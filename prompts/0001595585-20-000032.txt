ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Our goal is to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease, or CKD, through the treatment of metabolic acidosis. We are a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of our drug candidate, veverimer (also known as TRC101), a non-absorbed, orally-administered polymer designed to treat metabolic acidosis by binding and removing acid from the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract. Metabolic acidosis is a serious condition commonly caused by CKD and is believed to accelerate the progression of kidney deterioration. It can also lead to bone loss, muscle wasting and impaired physical function. Metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD is typically a chronic disease and, as such, requires long-term treatment to mitigate its deleterious consequences.
There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for treating chronic metabolic acidosis. We estimate that metabolic acidosis affects approximately 3 million patients with CKD in the United States, and we believe that treating metabolic acidosis and slowing the progression of CKD in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD represents a significant unmet medical need and market opportunity.
Veverimer is an in-house discovered, new chemical entity. We have a broad intellectual property estate that we believe will provide patent protection for veverimer until at least 2034 in the United States, the European Union, Japan, China, India and certain other markets.
Tricida is led by a seasoned management team that includes the founder of Ilypsa, Inc. and Relypsa, Inc. Our management team has extensive experience in the development and commercialization of therapeutics, with deep expertise in developing polymers for the treatment of kidney-related diseases.
Metabolic acidosis observed in patients with CKD is most often caused by an imbalance in acid production relative to acid excretion. The human body generates acid every day through normal food intake and metabolism. Sources of acid include amino acids and nucleic acids from daily dietary intake and digestion of proteins. The daily load of nonvolatile acids from metabolic processes amounts to approximately 1 milliequivalent, or mEq, per kilogram, or kg, of body weight, or 50 to 100 mEq per day for adults. A healthy kidney excretes this acid daily, but in patients with CKD acid excretion is compromised, and as a result, acid accumulates in the body. Over time, a vicious cycle of worsening metabolic acidosis and accelerated progression of kidney disease can result.
Acid binding is a novel approach to treating metabolic acidosis without introducing deleterious counterions or metals. This approach mimics the physiologic response to acid removal seen with persistent vomiting or nasogastric suction that results in an elevated serum bicarbonate level. To achieve the desired effect of increasing serum bicarbonate with a convenient daily dose of less than 10 grams per day, an acid binding polymer should have an amine capacity to bind at least 5 mEq of proton/gram. Once protonated, the acid binding polymer needs to preserve the effect of the proton binding by not removing anions such as fatty and bile acids that represent precursors metabolized to bicarbonate in the blood. The complementary anion to be bound that ensures net acid removal from the GI tract is chloride, the smallest anion present in the GI tract.
Veverimer is a low-swelling, spherical polymer bead that is approximately 100 micrometers in diameter. It is a single, high molecular weight, crosslinked polyamine molecule. The size of veverimer prevents systemic absorption from the GI tract. The high degree of cross-linking within veverimer limits swelling and the overall volume in the GI tract, with the goal of facilitating good GI tolerability. The high amine content of veverimer provides proton binding capacity of approximately 10 mEq/gram of polymer. The size exclusion built into the three-dimensional structure of the polymer enables preferential binding of chloride versus larger inorganic and organic anions, including phosphate, citrate, fatty acids and bile acids. This size exclusion mechanism allows a majority of the binding capacity to be used for hydrochloric acid binding.
Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for veverimer as a chronic treatment for metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, through the Accelerated Approval Program. The FDA has indicated that it is currently planning to hold a Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee, or CRDAC, meeting to discuss the application. The FDA has assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date of August 22, 2020 for the potential approval to market veverimer in the United States. We are currently conducting a confirmatory postmarketing trial, VALOR-CKD (also known as TRCA-303), as part of the Accelerated Approval Program.
Results from our positive Phase 3, 12-week efficacy trial, TRCA-301, and a follow-on 40-week extension trial, TRCA-301E, formed the primary clinical basis of our NDA submission. The Lancet published the results of the TRCA-301 trial in March 2019 and the results of the TRCA-301E trial in June 2019.
The TRCA-301 trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized 217 patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD and metabolic acidosis. The trial met both its primary and secondary endpoints in a highly statistically significant manner (p<0.0001 for both the primary and secondary endpoints). Veverimer was well tolerated in our TRCA-301 trial. The primary endpoint of the trial measured improvements in serum bicarbonate levels in veverimer-treated patients versus placebo. Serum bicarbonate is a surrogate measure of metabolic acidosis and a persistent serum bicarbonate level below 22 mEq/L indicates metabolic acidosis. After 12 weeks of treatment, 59.2% of subjects in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 22.5% of subjects in the placebo group, had an increase in serum bicarbonate level of at least 4 mEq/L or achieved a serum bicarbonate level in the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, which was the primary endpoint of the trial. The secondary endpoint of the trial, the least squares, or LS, mean change from baseline to week 12 in serum bicarbonate, was 4.42 mEq/L in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 1.78 mEq/L in the placebo group. The mean change in serum bicarbonate from baseline to week 12 was 4.5 mEq/L in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 1.7 mEq/L in the placebo group. 
The TRCA-301E trial was a blinded, 40-week extension of the 12-week TRCA-301 trial. One hundred ninety-six subjects, consisting of 114 subjects in the veverimer group and 82 subjects in the placebo group, elected and were qualified to continue in the extension trial. The primary endpoint of the TRCA-301E trial was an assessment of the long-term safety profile of veverimer versus placebo. We observed fewer discontinuations, fewer serious adverse events and a comparable rate of GI adverse events on veverimer versus placebo. The trial further demonstrated that the effect of veverimer on increasing serum bicarbonate was sustained over one year. The differences between veverimer and placebo on the two endpoints related to serum bicarbonate increase were highly statistically significant compared to placebo in both the TRCA-301 trial and the TRCA-301E trial.
The statistical analysis plan for the TRCA-301E trial included a pre-specified comparison of the veverimer and placebo groups for the time to first occurrence of any event in the composite clinical endpoint of all-cause mortality, dialysis/renal replacement therapy or a confirmed ≥50% decline in eGFR, or DD50. Although the trial was not designed or powered to assess all-cause mortality or the progression of CKD outcomes, we nevertheless observed a 65% reduction in the annualized DD50 event rate for veverimer-treated subjects compared with subjects on placebo. Over the combined 52-week treatment period, the annualized DD50 incidence rate was 12.0% in the placebo group versus 4.2% in the veverimer group (p=0.0224). There were 7 confirmed eGFR reductions ≥50%, 4 deaths and 1 dialysis initiation that occurred in 10 of the 82 subjects on placebo versus 5 confirmed eGFR reductions of greater than or equal to 50%, 0 deaths and 1 dialysis initiation that occurred in 5 of the 124 subjects on veverimer.
Patients with CKD are often frail and have impaired physical function, and metabolic acidosis is one factor that has been implicated as a potential contributor. Metabolic acidosis has direct effects on skeletal muscle catabolism and bone demineralization. Two large retrospective cohort analyses found that low serum bicarbonate level was independently associated with adverse health outcomes related to physical functioning, such as gait speed, quadriceps strength, failure to thrive and fractures/falls (Abramowitz et al., 2011; Reaven et al., 2019). Prospective studies of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD have shown that treatment of metabolic acidosis increased muscle mass (de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2009; Dubey et al., 2018) and improved muscle function (Abramowitz et al., 2013), and physical function related quality of life (de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2015).
We also assessed physical functioning both subjectively and objectively in our TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E studies. The subjective physical function endpoint examined the effect of treatment with veverimer on self-reported responses to the physical function subpart of the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life Short Form, or the KDQOL-SF, survey. This survey is a validated questionnaire for patients with kidney disease designed to assess health-related quality of life; the physical function subpart is based on activities of daily living. Subjects in the trial responded to 10 questions, each with a value of 10 points, resulting in a maximum score of 100 total points. After one year of treatment, there was no improvement in the placebo group, whose mean score decreased from a baseline score of 56 points to 55 points. However, subjects on veverimer had an 11-point improvement, on average, moving from a mean score of 53 points to 64 points (p<0.0001). The objective physical function endpoint examined the effect of treatment with veverimer on results of the Repeated Chair Stand Test. In this test, subjects were asked to stand up and sit down five times as quickly as possible, and the time for these five repetitions was recorded. At the end of one year of treatment, the average time for performing the Repeated Chair Stand Test decreased by 4.3 seconds on veverimer compared to 1.4 seconds on placebo compared to a baseline of 22 seconds and 21 seconds, on average, for the veverimer and placebo groups, respectively (p<0.0001).
An interesting concept has emerged in the academic literature that describes CKD as a clinical model of premature aging, indicating that patients with CKD often experience many of the complications of aging, but at younger ages than the general population. This includes elevated rates of aging-related disorders, including markedly reduced physical function compared to adult populations of the same age. This is a major problem because impaired physical function leads to significant morbidity, including high rates of falls and fractures, and is also a risk factor for death. Therefore, preserving physical function is critical in patients with CKD. Dr. Matthew Abramowitz, Associate Professor of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, has conducted a post-hoc analysis of age-related physical function improvements that were observed with veverimer in our TRCA-301E long-term extension trial. First, the analysis showed that at baseline, 45% of our study population was slower in performing the Repeated Chair Stand Test than the average 80- to 89-year old, despite an average age of 62 years. Second, the mean improvement of 4.3 seconds in the Repeated Chair Stand Test time observed in veverimer-treated subjects in the TRCA-301E study was greater than the difference in mean expected test-time performance between individuals in their 80s and those in their 60s, suggesting that the 4.3 second improvement in test time observed in veverimer-treated subjects is equivalent to an approximately 20-year reduction in aging-related physical functioning. Dr. Abramowitz concluded that interventions that improve physical function in patients with CKD have the potential to restore a substantial proportion of age-predicted loss of performance.
We believe the data from our TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E trials provide strong evidence that veverimer can effectively raise serum bicarbonate levels in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, and potentially slow progression of CKD as well as provide a clinically meaningful difference in physical function related quality of life and daily physical functioning. 
Given the high unmet medical need for an FDA-approved chronic treatment for metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, the broad understanding among nephrologists that treatment of metabolic acidosis can slow CKD progression, the favorable response from nephrologists to veverimer’s target product profile, and the potential health and economic benefits from treating metabolic acidosis, we believe that there is a significant opportunity for veverimer in the U.S. market, if approved, as the first and only FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of metabolic acidosis and slowing of kidney disease progression in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with CKD.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to develop and commercialize veverimer as the first and only FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of metabolic acidosis and slowing of kidney disease progression in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with CKD for the large population of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. Key elements of our strategy are to:
•Obtain FDA approval of veverimer. The veverimer NDA is currently under review through the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program. The FDA has assigned a PDUFA goal date of August 22, 2020 for the potential approval to market veverimer in the United States. 
•Expand awareness of, and educate nephrologists on, the consequences of untreated metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD. We are building a team of 15 to 20 Medical Science Liaisons, or MSLs, to facilitate education and answer questions from nephrologists about metabolic acidosis and veverimer.
•Commercialize veverimer in the United States. If veverimer is approved by the FDA, we plan to initially commercialize it in the United States by deploying an 80- to 90-person specialty sales force targeting that subset of nephrologists most focused on treating patients with CKD. With this approach, we believe we can reach a majority of the approximately 600,000 patients with metabolic acidosis and Stage 3 to 5 CKD that are cared for by nephrologists. 
•Commercialize veverimer outside of the United States with one or more partners. We believe there is a significant commercial opportunity for veverimer in markets outside the United States. To address these markets, we plan to seek one or more partners with international sales expertise who can commercialize veverimer in target markets, if approved.
Chronic Kidney Disease and Metabolic Acidosis Represent a Major Health Crisis
Overview of CKD
CKD is a serious condition characterized by the gradual loss of essential kidney functions over time. In patients with CKD, normal fluid and electrolyte balance can no longer be maintained, and the excretion of metabolic end products, toxins and drugs is impaired. Furthermore, production and secretion of certain enzymes and hormones are disturbed.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, more than 37 million people in the United States are afflicted with CKD, representing an overall prevalence in the adult population of approximately 15%. The incidence of CKD is primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes and hypertension. The treatment of CKD adds a tremendous financial burden to the United States, with annual Medicare expenses for CKD in 2018 totaling approximately $114 billion, including approximately $79 billion on CKD costs and approximately $35 billion for end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, costs. ESRD is total and permanent kidney failure that is treated with kidney dialysis or with a kidney transplant. There are approximately 750,000 people in the United States living on kidney dialysis or with a kidney transplant and approximately 125,000 new ESRD cases occur annually. Each year kidney disease kills more people than breast cancer or prostate cancer. According to the 2019 United States Renal Data System report, there were approximately 105,000 deaths from ESRD in 2017. There is a significant medical need to slow progression of kidney disease and reduce the number of patients progressing to kidney failure.
To help improve the diagnosis and management of kidney disease, the National Kidney Foundation, or NKF, has divided CKD into five stages. The severity of CKD at each stage is identified by the estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR. Treatment during the first four stages of CKD focuses on ways to preserve kidney function for as long as possible. ESRD is the final stage of CKD in which the patient typically requires renal replacement therapy, i.e., dialysis or a kidney transplant, for survival.
Stages of CKD
Overview of Metabolic Acidosis
Diabetes and hypertension have long been recognized as modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD. More recently, metabolic acidosis, a serious condition in which the body has accumulated too much acid, has also been identified as a key modifiable risk factor for the progression of CKD.
The human body generates acid every day through normal food intake and metabolism. Sources of acid include amino acids and nucleic acids from daily dietary intake and digestion of proteins. A healthy kidney counteracts these sources of acid through excretion mechanisms that rid the body of the excess acid and by restoring bicarbonate, a base 
that buffers acid. Metabolic acidosis results when the kidneys can no longer excrete sufficient acid or reabsorb sufficient bicarbonate back into the blood stream to balance acid production. If left untreated, metabolic acidosis can result in accelerated kidney disease progression and has also been shown to negatively impact bone and muscle health.
Metabolic acidosis can be diagnosed by measuring the level of bicarbonate in the serum, which is routinely analyzed as part of a standard metabolic panel. Properly functioning kidneys will maintain a serum bicarbonate level of between 22 to 29 milliequivalents per liter, or mEq/L. A persistent serum bicarbonate level below 22 mEq/L indicates metabolic acidosis.
The prevalence and severity of metabolic acidosis in people with CKD progressively rises as kidney function declines. We estimate the prevalence of metabolic acidosis to be 9.4% of the estimated 15 million patients with Stage 3a CKD, 18.1% of the estimated 6 million patients with Stage 3b CKD and 31.5% of the estimated 2 million patients with Stage 4 and Stage 5 CKD (non-dialysis patients), resulting in a total estimated prevalence of approximately 3 million patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD in the United States.
Metabolic Acidosis Poses a Significant Health Risk to Approximately 3 Million Patients with CKD in the United States
Metabolic acidosis can accelerate kidney disease progression and lead to bone demineralization and muscle wasting. In patients with CKD, adaptations by the kidneys in response to an accumulating acid load result in increased acid excretion per nephron by the remaining nephrons, but over time these adaptations have deleterious effects on kidney tissue, resulting in further kidney damage. The specific mechanisms that link metabolic acidosis to accelerated progression of kidney disease involve a cascade of events whereby acid accumulation leads to increased production of select peptides and hormones, including endothelin-1, aldosterone and angiotensin II, that increase the secretion of acid through the proximal and distal renal tubules of the remaining healthy nephrons in the compromised kidney. This provides a short-term beneficial impact on acid excretion, however, sustained over-production of these hormones results in long-term consequences, including inflammation, renal fibrosis, tubular atrophy and proteinuria. Over time, a vicious cycle of worsening metabolic acidosis and accelerated progression of kidney disease can result.
An increased risk of fractures and renal osteodystrophy as well as muscle wasting and reduced physical functioning have also been associated with worsening metabolic acidosis. In patients with CKD whose kidney function is not sufficient to excrete their daily acid load, bone and muscle provide buffers for circulating acid, resulting in loss of bone density and increased muscle protein catabolism. Two large retrospective cohort analyses found that low serum bicarbonate level was independently associated with adverse health outcomes related to physical functioning, such as gait speed, quadriceps strength, failure to thrive and fractures/falls (Abramowitz et al., 2011; Reaven et al., 2019). Prospective studies of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD have shown that treatment of metabolic acidosis increased muscle mass (de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2009; Dubey et al., 2018), improved muscle function (Abramowitz et al., 2013), and improved physical function related quality of life (de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2015).
The importance of treating metabolic acidosis has been noted in both National and International kidney disease treatment guidelines. The NKF’s Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, or KDOQI, guidelines and the International Society of Nephology’s Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, or KDIGO, guidelines recommend that in patients with CKD, serum bicarbonate be maintained above 22 mEq/L. Serum bicarbonate concentrations <22 mEq/L are associated with increased risk of CKD progression and increased risk of death.
There is Substantial Evidence that Low Serum Bicarbonate Levels are Associated with Increased Risk of CKD Progression and that Treating Metabolic Acidosis Can Slow the Progression of CKD
Several prospective clinical studies have shown that treating metabolic acidosis can slow the progression of CKD. In addition, multiple retrospective studies provide qualitative and quantitative evidence for the relationship between metabolic acidosis and the risk of progression of CKD across a wide range of baseline eGFRs and serum bicarbonate levels. 
In particular, five prospective trials (Garneata et al., 2016; de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2009; Phisitkul et al., 2010; Dubey et al., 2018; Di Iorio et al., 2019) studying patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD and metabolic acidosis demonstrated slowing of CKD progression following an increase in serum bicarbonate with three different interventions, comprising a very low-protein diet, oral sodium bicarbonate and oral sodium citrate. Increases in serum bicarbonate resulted in improved clinical outcomes, including fewer patients who progressed to ESRD and/or experienced significant declines of eGFR. Additionally, clinical trials reported by Goraya et al., 2013 and 2014 and Mahajan et al., 2010 showed that, in patients with Stages 2 to 4 CKD due to hypertensive nephropathy, increasing serum bicarbonate levels with sodium bicarbonate or a low protein diet rich in fruits and vegetables resulted in reduced markers of kidney injury and slower decline in eGFR. It should be noted that these trials were open-label trials that generally did not enroll patients with diabetes, heart failure, edema, uncontrolled hypertension, obesity, clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease, and other conditions related to sodium sensitive comorbidities. As such, the patients in these trials did not fully represent the general population of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. It is estimated that approximately 90% of late stage patients with CKD have sodium sensitive comorbidities.
Four large published retrospective database analyses show an association between higher serum bicarbonate levels and slower progression of CKD, independent of baseline eGFR and other factors such as age, sex, proteinuria, hypertension and diabetes (Dobre et al., 2013; Raphael et al., 2011; Shah et al., 2009; Tangri et al., 2011). In these four distinct large cohorts of patients with CKD, the analyses all demonstrate that clinical outcomes for patients with CKD with serum bicarbonate levels that are below normal (i.e., <22 mEq/L) are significantly worse compared to patients with normal serum bicarbonate levels (i.e., 22 to 29 mEq/L).
A validated model which is an accepted standard for predicting the risk of kidney disease progression has been published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA (Tangri et al., 2011). This model includes serum bicarbonate as one of the key variables predicting chronic kidney disease progression. Dr. Navdeep Tangri, Associate Professor of Medicine in the Department of Medicine and Community Health Sciences and the Scientific Director of the Chronic Disease Innovation Center at University of Manitoba, presented data at the NKF 2018 Spring Clinical Meeting that describes an analysis of the relationship between serum bicarbonate and a composite renal outcome (≥40% reduction in eGFR or ESRD). This work demonstrated the quantitative relationship between an increase in serum bicarbonate and the reduction in risk of kidney disease progression. The relationship between serum bicarbonate and the renal outcome was approximately linear, independent of baseline kidney function (eGFR), and consistent across subgroups of patients with reduced eGFR and those with established metabolic acidosis. Furthermore, it showed that each 1 mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate is associated with a 6% to 9% reduction in the risk of CKD progression.
The Unmet Medical Need for the Chronic Treatment of Metabolic Acidosis
The need to treat metabolic acidosis to slow the progression of CKD is well established, yet there are no FDA-approved therapies for the chronic treatment of metabolic acidosis. Kidney disease treatment guidelines recommend treating metabolic acidosis when serum bicarbonate falls below 22 mEq/L, but in the absence of an FDA-approved treatment, physicians are left with recommending either protein-restricted diets to reduce acid intake or unapproved, over-the-counter supplements that have not undergone the scrutiny of rigorous clinical examination, including evaluation of safety, efficacy and their interactions with other drugs. 
Several analyses of retrospective databases show that, despite its prevalence, metabolic acidosis has gone largely untreated. One recent analysis of the diagnosis and treatment rates of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD indicates that it is both underdiagnosed and undertreated. At the ASN Kidney Week 2019 Meeting, Dr. Tangri, presented an analysis of data from the Symphony Health Solutions Integrated Dataverse®, or IDV, which quantified the diagnosis and treatment rates of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD. This analysis, which was derived from a cohort of approximately 87,000 patients, showed that only 21% of patients with confirmed laboratory evidence of metabolic acidosis and CKD had been diagnosed with metabolic acidosis and only 15% of these patients had been treated for metabolic acidosis. 
Three other analyses indicate that oral alkali supplements are used in less than 10% of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. An evaluation of data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort, or CRIC, study (Dobre et al., 2012) showed that less than 3%, or 28 of 1,039 patients with CKD and serum bicarbonate levels ≤22mEq/L were receiving an oral alkali supplement. A retrospective cohort study of adults in Manitoba, Canada, (Tangri et al., 2020), concluded that less than 6% of 5,368 patients with CKD and serum bicarbonate values between 12-22 mEq/L were receiving an oral alkali supplement. Because the Canadian health care system includes oral alkali supplements in their formulary, the analysis included an evaluation of the adherence to oral alkali supplements. The data show that, more than two thirds of patients (68%) had discontinued oral alkali therapy at one year. The use of oral alkali supplements in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD who were enrolled in the TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E clinical trials was less than 10% of subjects enrolled in the study (Wesson et al., 2019).
Oral Alkali Use is Low in Patients with Metabolic Acidosis and CKD
Dobre, 2012, Tangri 2020, Wesson, 2019, Tangri 2019.
Our primary research indicates that most nephrologists understand the importance of treating metabolic acidosis to slow kidney disease progression, yet the analyses of actual treatment rates indicate a serious gap between the understanding and actual diagnosis and treatment. We believe that this gap is due to the lack of an FDA-approved chronic treatment for metabolic acidosis that can be used in the broad population of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, including those with sodium-sensitive comorbidities. 
The low use of oral alkali supplements may be explained by the lack of supportive data from blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials that confirm the efficacy and safety of these unapproved supplements. While clinical research studies conducted in carefully selected patient populations have shown that oral alkali supplementation can result in slowing of CKD progression in patients with metabolic acidosis, two recent multicenter, placebo-controlled studies that used doses of sodium bicarbonate typically used in clinical practice, i.e., 0.5 to 1.0 grams, three times daily, both achieved very little difference in mean serum bicarbonate level between the active and placebo groups (approximately 1 mEq/L difference after 2 years) and showed no clinical benefits of sodium bicarbonate treatment (the BiCARB Study, Witham et al., ERA-EDTA Poster Presentation 2019; Melamed et al., 2019). The doses of sodium bicarbonate used in these trials may not have been large enough to achieve sufficient separation in serum bicarbonate in active- versus placebo-treated subjects. These doses may have been chosen because of concern for the deleterious effect of sodium that is delivered with orally administered alkali supplements, particularly in the CKD patient population. Each gram of sodium bicarbonate delivers 274 mg of sodium.
Approximately 90% of patients with later-stage CKD suffer from sodium-sensitive comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, heart failure or edema, and require a sodium-restricted diet. KDIGO guidelines recommend that patients with CKD consume less than 2 grams of total sodium per day, but according to the CDC, the average diet in the United States includes approximately 3.4 grams of sodium each day. It has been demonstrated that achieving a 2 to 3 mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate requires 4 to 6 grams of sodium bicarbonate (for an 80 kilogram, or kg, patient) which results in an additional 1.1 to 1.6 grams of sodium added to the patient’s daily intake, which is already in excess of guideline recommendations (Abramowitz et al., 2013).
The effects of oral alkali supplementation on overall health and wellbeing also require further evaluation. One of the first multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo (Witham et al., ERA-EDTA Poster Presentation 2019) was commissioned by the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment Programme to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of oral sodium bicarbonate in the management of older people with CKD and mild metabolic acidosis. The trial enrolled 300 non-dialysis patients with Stage 4 or 5 CKD with serum bicarbonate concentrations <22 mEq/L recruited from 27 sites in the United Kingdom. Subjects were randomized to treatment with approximately 1.5 to 3 grams of sodium bicarbonate per day or placebo. The primary outcome and additional outcome measures were designed to assess physical function improvements and health related quality of life measures. Following 12 months of treatment, there was no significant treatment effect for the primary outcome of the between-group difference in the Short Physical Performance Battery at 12 months (-0.4 points; 95% CI -0.9 to 0.1, p=0.15). There was no significant treatment benefit seen for any of the secondary outcomes. Adverse events were more frequent in the sodium bicarbonate arm (457 versus 400) and the time to commencing renal replacement therapy was similar in both groups (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.02, p=0.43). Sodium bicarbonate provided no significant treatment effect and adverse events were more frequent in the bicarbonate arm. Health economic analysis showed lower quality of life and higher costs in the sodium bicarbonate arm at one year. In addition, placebo dominated sodium bicarbonate for all sensitivity analyses of incremental cost-effectiveness. The discontinuation rates in the BICARB trial were 25% and 30% at Year 1 in the sodium bicarbonate group and placebo group, respectively, and 47% and 46% at Year 2 in the sodium bicarbonate group and placebo group, respectively. 
Effects of sodium bicarbonate treatment on GI tolerability, blood pressure and volume status have been observed in some clinical trials. For example, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, open-label single-site study conducted by Dubey et al., 2018, six months of treatment with sodium bicarbonate was less well tolerated than placebo. This study evaluated a broader population of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, including those with sodium-sensitive comorbidities. Overall, adverse events occurred in significantly (p=0.01) more subjects in the sodium bicarbonate group compared to the control group. The safety profile of oral sodium bicarbonate showed that more subjects experienced GI side effects, fluid retention and worsening hypertension compared to placebo, despite significantly higher use of diuretics in the sodium bicarbonate group (p=0.008).
The use of sodium-based alkali supplements may also impact the effectiveness of other medications important to the treatment of many patients with CKD. In particular, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors, or RAASi, are one of the only classes of agents that have been proven to slow CKD progression. Higher sodium intake has been 
associated with significant reductions in the effectiveness of these agents. A study by Lambers Heerspink and colleagues (Lambers Heerspink et al., 2012) evaluated the impact of low, medium and high levels of 24-hour sodium/creatinine ratio in patients administered angiotensin II receptor blockers, or ARBs, versus non-RAASi treated patients. They concluded that “The renal and cardiovascular protective effects of ARB therapy compared with non-RAASi–based therapy attenuated in subjects with larger consumption of sodium so that in subjects with the highest sodium intake the treatment effects on hard renal and cardiovascular outcomes were completely annihilated.” Approximately 70% of patients with CKD are treated with RAASi to manage their hypertension.
Given the lack of a proven safe and efficacious agent to effectively raise serum bicarbonate and treat metabolic acidosis, we believe there is a significant unmet medical need for an FDA-approved agent to chronically treat metabolic acidosis in the approximately 3 million patients in the United States that are afflicted with metabolic acidosis and CKD. 
Our Solution—Veverimer
Veverimer is a novel, non-absorbed, orally-administered polymer that is designed to bind hydrochloric acid in the GI tract and remove it from the body through excretion in the feces, thereby decreasing the total amount of acid in the body and increasing serum bicarbonate. Veverimer is administered orally as a suspension in water. Veverimer removes acid without delivering additional sodium or other counterions, such as potassium or calcium, which, if approved, would allow for the chronic treatment of patients with common sodium-sensitive comorbidities such as hypertension, edema and heart failure.
Veverimer Target Product Profile
We have designed veverimer to target the following product profile:
•Effectively Treat Metabolic Acidosis: Bind and remove sufficient amounts of acid such that a majority of the patients will achieve a clinically meaningful increase in serum bicarbonate.
•Well-Tolerated: Based on our long-term TRCA-301E trial results, patients reported GI-related adverse events at a similar rate to placebo. These events were generally mild, self-limited and did not require treatment or dose adjustment of veverimer.
•Suitable for a Broad Population of Patients, including Patients with Sodium-Sensitive Comorbidities: Treat metabolic acidosis without delivering sodium or other counterions.
•Compatible with Other Medications: Allow concomitant dosing of common CKD medications. Veverimer’s unique characteristics include a particle size designed to prevent systemic absorption and size-exclusion that provides high selectivity for hydrochloric acid.
•Convenient, Once-Daily, Oral Administration: In our pivotal TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E trial, subjects self-administered 3-, 6- or 9-gram doses, once daily, with high overall compliance.
•Room-Temperature Stable: Current data demonstrate 12-month room temperature stability and we plan to have data supporting 24-month shelf-life at room temperature at the time of the commercial launch.
Veverimer Mechanism of Action
The human body generates acid every day through normal food intake and metabolism. Sources of acid include amino acids and nucleic acids from daily dietary intake and digestion of proteins. The daily load of nonvolatile acids from metabolic processes amounts to approximately 1 mEq per kg of body weight, or 50 to 100 mEq per day for adults. Prior studies with alkali supplementation have shown that neutralization of 40% to 80% (20 to 80 mEq) of the daily acid produced can increase serum bicarbonate levels (de Brito-Ashurst et al., 2009; Phisitkul et al., 2010).
Acid binding is a novel approach to treating metabolic acidosis and increasing serum bicarbonate levels without introducing deleterious counterions or metals. This approach mimics the physiologic response to acid removal seen with persistent vomiting or nasogastric suction that results in an elevated serum bicarbonate level. To achieve the desired effect of increasing serum bicarbonate with a convenient daily dose of less than 10 grams per day, an acid binding polymer should have an amine capacity to bind at least 5 mEq of proton/gram. Once protonated, the acid binding polymer needs to preserve the effect of the proton binding by not removing anions such as fatty and bile acids that represent precursors metabolized to bicarbonate in the blood. The complementary anion to be bound that ensures net acid removal from the GI tract is chloride, the smallest anion present in the GI tract.
Veverimer is a low-swelling, spherical polymer bead that is approximately 100 micrometers in diameter. It is a single, high molecular weight, crosslinked polyamine molecule. The size of veverimer prevents systemic absorption from the GI tract. The high degree of cross-linking within veverimer limits swelling and the overall volume in the GI tract, with the goal of facilitating good GI tolerability. The high amine content of veverimer provides proton binding capacity of approximately 10 mEq/gram of polymer. Size exclusion built into the three-dimensional structure of the polymer enables preferential binding of chloride versus larger inorganic and organic anions, including phosphate, citrate, fatty acids and bile acids. This size exclusion mechanism allows a majority of the binding capacity to be used for hydrochloric acid binding.
The mechanism of action of veverimer is illustrated below:
Veverimer Mechanism of Action
Our Development Program for Veverimer
Overview
Our NDA for veverimer is under review by the FDA through the Accelerated Approval Program for potential approval as the first and only FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of metabolic acidosis and slowing of kidney disease progression in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with CKD. It has been assigned a PDUFA goal date of August 22, 2020 for the potential approval to market veverimer in the United States. The FDA has indicated that it is currently planning to hold a CRDAC meeting to discuss the NDA. The key clinical trials included in the NDA are our successful 135-subject, Phase 1/2 trial, TRCA-101, a successful 217-subject, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, TRCA-301 and a successful 196-subject, Phase 3 extension trial, TRCA-301E.
Both TRCA-101 and the pivotal study, TRCA-301, utilized change from baseline in serum bicarbonate as their primary endpoint. Eligible subjects who completed the 12-week treatment period in the pivotal TRCA-301 trial were invited to continue in our extension trial, TRCA-301E. The primary endpoint of the TRCA-301E trial was the assessment of the long-term safety profile of veverimer versus placebo. We believe that the data from the TRCA-101, TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E clinical trials will provide sufficient clinical evidence of safety and efficacy to support the approval of our NDA for veverimer pursuant to the Accelerated Approval Program.
As part of the Accelerated Approval Program, we are currently conducting a confirmatory postmarketing trial, known as the VALOR-CKD trial, or TRCA-303, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of veverimer in delaying CKD progression in subjects with metabolic acidosis. We initiated the VALOR-CKD confirmatory postmarketing trial in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Veverimer Clinical and Nonclinical Results
TRCA-301 Phase 3 Clinical Trial and TRCA-301E Extension Clinical Trial
TRCA-301 Phase 3 Clinical Trial
In May 2018, we completed our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, TRCA-301, and in March 2019, the results of this trial were published in The Lancet. The double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 217 subjects with Stage 3b or 4 CKD (an estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, of 20 to 40 mL/min/1.73m2) and low serum bicarbonate levels (between 12 and 20 mEq/L). At the beginning of the 12-week treatment period, subjects were randomized in a 4:3 ratio to receive once-daily, or QD, veverimer or placebo. Subjects in the active group initially received a QD dose of 6 grams of veverimer (2 packets). After week 4, bi-directional blinded dose adjustments to 3 grams/day (1 packet) or 9 grams/day (3 packets) were allowed in order to maintain serum bicarbonate in the normal range. Subjects in the placebo group initially received 2 packets of placebo, with the same ability for bi-directional dose adjustments after 4 weeks. The dose titration algorithm required down-titration at serum bicarbonate values of ≥ 27 to ≤ 30 mEq/L. Subjects with a serum bicarbonate level >30 mEq/L underwent an interruption of the study drug in accordance with the titration algorithm. Subjects were permitted to continue their existing oral alkali supplement during the trial, provided dosing remained stable. We conducted the trial at 47 sites in the United States and Europe, of which 37 sites enrolled patients.
TRCA-301 Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial
The underlying comorbid conditions of veverimer-treated subjects and subjects in the placebo group in the TRCA-301 trial were well-balanced and included 97% hypertension, 65% type 2 diabetes, 44% left ventricular hypertrophy, and 31% congestive heart failure. During the three months prior to baseline, 12% of subjects had shortness of breath with exertion and 9% had edema or fluid overload. Nine percent of the total patient population in the trial reported the use of oral alkali therapy at baseline.
TRCA-301 Pivotal Phase 3 Trial Results
Primary and Secondary Endpoints
The serum bicarbonate levels of subjects were measured on day 1, week 1, week 2, and bi-weekly thereafter, up to and including week 14, which was a final post-treatment visit for those subjects not continuing into the TRCA-301E extension trial. The primary endpoint of the trial was an increase in serum bicarbonate level of at least 4 mEq/L or achieving a serum bicarbonate level in the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, at the end of the 12-week treatment period. The secondary endpoint of the trial was the change from baseline in serum bicarbonate at the end of the 12-week treatment period.
Analysis of our TRCA-301 pivotal Phase 3 trial demonstrated that treatment with veverimer resulted in statistically significant increases in serum bicarbonate, meeting both the primary and secondary endpoints. After 12 weeks of treatment, 59.2% of subjects in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 22.5% of subjects in the placebo group, had an increase in serum bicarbonate level of at least 4 mEq/L or achieved a serum bicarbonate level in the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, which was the primary endpoint of the trial. The secondary endpoint of the trial, the least squares, or LS, mean change from baseline to week 12 in serum bicarbonate, was 4.42 mEq/L in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 1.78 mEq/L in the placebo group. The mean change in serum bicarbonate from baseline to week 12 was 4.5 mEq/L in the veverimer-treated group, compared with 1.7 mEq/L in the placebo group. The results of the primary and secondary endpoints were both highly statistically significant (p<0.0001).
Summary Data for Our Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial, TRCA-301
Safety
The overall safety profile of veverimer observed in our pivotal Phase 3 trial, TRCA-301, is consistent with that expected for the general population of patients with Stage 3 to 5 non-dialysis CKD and with similar non-absorbed polymer drugs with a site of action in the gastrointestinal tract. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and balanced in the two treatment groups. The types of serious adverse events were consistent with those expected in the study population, and none of the serious adverse events were assessed to be related to treatment by the trial investigator, Medical Monitor or Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team. There were two deaths in the study and both of these occurred in the placebo group.
Veverimer was well tolerated in our pivotal Phase 3 trial, TRCA-301. In total, over 95% of subjects in each of the groups completed the trial. Overall treatment-related adverse events occurred in 9.7% of subjects in the placebo group and 13.7% of veverimer-treated subjects. The most common treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate GI disorders, which occurred in 5.4% of subjects in the placebo group and 12.9% of veverimer-treated subjects. The treatment-related GI adverse events that occurred in more than one subject in the trial included diarrhea, flatulence, nausea and constipation. The only other treatment-related adverse event that occurred in more than one subject was paresthesia (1.1% of subjects in the placebo group and 0.8% of veverimer-treated subjects). There were no apparent effects of veverimer on serum parameters, such as sodium, calcium, potassium, phosphate, magnesium, or low-density lipoprotein observed in the trial that would indicate off-target effects of veverimer. A high serum bicarbonate level, defined as greater than 30 mEq/L, was observed transiently in 2 subjects, or 0.9%. Discontinuation of veverimer per the protocol-defined dosing algorithm resulted in normalization of serum bicarbonate in these subjects.
TRCA-301E Extension Trial
The TRCA-301E trial was a blinded, 40-week extension of the 12-week TRCA-301 trial, which randomized 217 subjects with non-dialysis dependent CKD and metabolic acidosis to treatment with veverimer (N=124) or placebo (N=93). Two hundred eight (208; 95.9%) subjects completed the 12-week treatment period in the TRCA-301 trial and had the option to continue into the extension trial and receive the same blinded treatment (veverimer or placebo) to which they were assigned in the parent study. Of these, one hundred ninety-six subjects (196; 94.2%), (114 in the veverimer group and 82 in the placebo group) elected and were qualified to continue in the extension trial. One hundred eleven (111; 97.4%) subjects in the veverimer group and 74 (90.2%) subjects in placebo group completed the one year treatment period. 
TRCA-301E Phase 3 Extension Clinical Trial
TRCA-301E Clinical Trial Results
The TRCA-301E trial met its primary and all secondary endpoints. The primary endpoint of the TRCA-301E trial was the assessment of the long-term safety profile of veverimer versus placebo. Fewer subjects on veverimer than on placebo discontinued the 40-week treatment period prematurely (2.6% versus 9.8%, respectively). The incidence of serious adverse events was 1.8% for subjects in the veverimer group and 4.9% for subjects in the placebo group, and none were assessed to be related to study drug by the trial investigator, Medical Monitor or Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team. The only adverse event with a between-group frequency difference of >5% was headache, which was more common in the placebo group. Gastrointestinal disorders adverse events occurred in 21.4% of subjects in the veverimer group and in 25.9% of subjects in the placebo group. No subjects in the veverimer group discontinued study treatment due to an adverse event. One subject (1.2%) in the placebo group discontinued study treatment due to an adverse event of end-stage renal disease.
The statistical analysis plan for the TRCA-301E trial also specified a comparison of the veverimer and placebo groups for the time to the composite clinical endpoint of death (all-cause mortality), dialysis/kidney transplant (renal replacement therapy) or a ≥50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, (taken together, DD50) over the combined (TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E) 52-week treatment period. Of the 124 subjects randomized to the veverimer group, 5 (4.0%) subjects had a DD50 event. There were no deaths in the veverimer group and one veverimer-treated subject initiated dialysis during the 52-week treatment period. Of the 93 subjects randomized to the placebo group, 10 (10.8%) subjects had a DD50 event, including four subjects who died and one who initiated dialysis during the 52-week treatment period. The time to DD50 was prolonged in the veverimer group compared to the placebo group, with an annualized DD50 incidence rate, calculated as 100 times the number of events divided by the total person-years, of 4.2% in the veverimer group versus 12.0% in the placebo group (p = 0.0224). The TRCA-301/TRCA-301E clinical trials were not designed or powered to assess all-cause mortality and/or the progression of CKD outcomes; they enrolled only 217 subjects and followed them over a one-year treatment period to support the long-term safety and efficacy profile of veverimer. Nevertheless, a 65% reduction in the annualized event rate of the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and progression of CKD (DD50) in veverimer-treated subjects versus subjects in the placebo group was observed.
TRCA-301 / TRCA-301E Trial Results (52 Weeks)
Prespecified Time-to-Event Analyses
The secondary endpoints of the TRCA-301E trial assessed the durability of effect of veverimer, both on serum bicarbonate levels and on measures of physical function, over the 52-week treatment period for those subjects who participated in the TRCA-301E trial. All were met with high statistical significance.
The durability of effect of veverimer was assessed by comparing the changes in serum bicarbonate from baseline between veverimer versus placebo subjects who completed the 52-week treatment period. Sixty-three percent of the 110 veverimer subjects treated for 52 weeks exhibited an increase in serum bicarbonate level of at least 4 mEq/L or achieved a serum bicarbonate level in the normal range of 22 to 29 mEq/L, compared with 38% of the 74 placebo subjects who completed 52 weeks of treatment (p=0.0015). The LS mean change in serum bicarbonate from baseline to end of treatment in the veverimer group was 4.7 mEq/L, compared with 2.7 mEq/L in the placebo group (p=0.0002). In veverimer-treated subjects, the proportion of subjects achieving an increase of at least 4 mEq/L or normalization of serum bicarbonate and the magnitude of the change in serum bicarbonate levels from baseline to Week 52 were both similar at Week 12 (61% and 4.6 mEq/L, respectively) and Week 52 (63% and 4.7 mEq/L, respectively). We believe these results provided evidence of the long-term durability of serum bicarbonate effect of veverimer-treated group compared to placebo. 
Measures of physical function were assessed through the self-reported responses to the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand Test. Improvement from baseline to end of treatment in the self-reported responses to the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey was significantly greater in the veverimer group (11.4 points) compared to the placebo group (-0.7 points), with a between-group difference of 12.1 points in favor of veverimer (p<0.0001). The 11.4-point improvement in the veverimer group far exceeded the 3- to 5-point change cited in the literature as the minimal clinically important difference for KDQOL subscales. 
Improvement from baseline to end of treatment in physical function using the Repeated Chair Stand Test was also significantly greater in the veverimer group (4.3 seconds faster) compared to the placebo group (1.4 seconds faster), with a between-group difference of 2.9 seconds in favor of veverimer (p<0.0001). The placebo-adjusted improvements in favor of veverimer-treated subjects in the two measures of physical function at week 52 approximately doubled compared to the results at week 12 observed in the parent trial, TRCA-301. The 4.3-second improvement in the time to complete the Repeated Chair Stand Test far exceeded the 1.7-second improvement cited in the literature as the minimal clinically important difference for improvement in this measure of objective physical function. We believe the 
results from the KDQOL Physical Functioning Survey and the Repeated Chair Stand Test are consistent with each other and both indicate a clinically meaningful improvement in physical function and related aspects of quality of life for veverimer-treated subjects.
TRCA-301 / TRCA-301E Trial Results (52 Weeks)
Clinically Meaningful Improvement in Physical Function
An interesting concept has emerged in the academic literature that describes CKD as a clinical model of premature aging, indicating that patients with CKD often experience many of the complications of aging, but at younger ages than the general population. This includes elevated rates of aging-related disorders, including markedly reduced physical function compared to adult populations of the same age. This is a major problem because impaired physical function leads to significant morbidity, including high rates of falls and fractures, and is also a risk factor for death. Therefore, preserving physical function is critical in patients with CKD. Dr. Matthew Abramowitz, Associate Professor of Medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, has conducted a post-hoc analysis of age-related physical function improvements that were observed with veverimer in our TRCA-301E long-term extension trial. First, the analysis showed that at baseline, 45% of our study population was slower in performing the Repeated Chair Stand Test than the 
average 80 to 89-year old, despite an average age of 62 years. Second, the mean improvement of 4.3 seconds in Repeated Chair Stand Test time observed in veverimer-treated subjects in the TRCA-301E study was greater than the difference in mean expected test-time performance between individuals in their 80s and those in their 60s, suggesting that the 4.3 second improvement in test time observed in veverimer-treated subjects is equivalent to an approximately 20-year reduction in aging-related physical functioning. Dr. Abramowitz concluded that interventions that improve physical function in patients with CKD have the potential to restore a substantial proportion of age-predicted loss of performance.
TRCA-101 Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial
In 2016, we completed our Phase 1/2 trial, TRCA-101, a 135-subject, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of veverimer. In this trial, subjects received either placebo or one of four different dosing regimens of veverimer for two weeks as shown in the diagram below:
Veverimer Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial
The subjects were patients with Stage 3 or 4 CKD with serum bicarbonate levels at baseline between 12 and 20 mEq/L. The treatment groups were demographically well matched, and the mean serum bicarbonate levels at baseline ranged between 17.5 and 18.0 mEq/L across the treatment groups. Comorbid conditions of the subjects enrolled in TRCA-101 included 93% of patients with hypertension, 70% with type 2 diabetes, 29% with left ventricular hypertrophy and 21% with congestive heart failure. We conducted the trial at five in-patient clinical research units where the subjects were monitored for the duration of the 2-week treatment period. During the 16-day in-unit residence (including the 14-day treatment period), clinical trial subjects were given a diet controlled for protein, caloric content, anions, cations and fiber, in accordance with dietary recommendations for patients with CKD. The potential renal acid load, or PRAL, value was calculated for the daily meal plans to ensure that the trial diet was neither acidic nor basic. Daily PRAL values averaged 0.8 mEq/day. Average protein intake during the trial was 0.7 g/kg/day.
The serum bicarbonate levels of subjects were measured on a daily basis. Statistically significant increases in serum bicarbonate levels were observed in all veverimer-treated groups within 24 to 72 hours of initiation of therapy. After 14 days of treatment, the mean increase in serum bicarbonate levels from baseline in each of the veverimer-treated groups was between 2.95 and 3.83 mEq/L, with a mean serum bicarbonate increase of 3.3 mEq/L in the combined veverimer group. All these results were highly statistically significant (p-value < 0.0001), as were the increases from baseline as compared to the placebo group, whose mean serum bicarbonate level decreased by 0.18 mEq/L. The serum bicarbonate levels of all subjects were measured during the off-treatment follow-up period. In the veverimer-treated groups, the mean levels had reverted to near baseline levels after two weeks off treatment.
Veverimer Significantly Increased Mean Serum Bicarbonate Throughout the
2-week Treatment Period, with Serum Bicarbonate Rapidly Returning
Toward Baseline After Treatment Discontinuation
In our Phase 1/2 trial, veverimer was well-tolerated. All subjects completed treatment and remained in the trial through the applicable follow-up period. All treatment emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, were mild or moderate, and there were no serious adverse events. The most common TEAE was diarrhea which was reported by 20.2% of veverimer-treated subjects as compared to 12.9% of subjects in the placebo group. All cases of diarrhea were mild, self-limited, and none required treatment. There were no apparent effects of veverimer on parameters, such as sodium, calcium, potassium, phosphate, magnesium, or low-density lipoprotein observed in the trial that would indicate off-target effects of veverimer. There were no apparent effects on vital signs, such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate or temperature, or body weight. The results of this trial were published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (Bushinsky, et al., 2018).
Nonclinical Studies
We have conducted a range of nonclinical in vivo and in vitro studies to assess the mechanism of action, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of veverimer.
Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies demonstrated robust proton and chloride binding and retention by the veverimer polymer resulting in removal of hydrochloric acid from the body. In vitro studies demonstrated that veverimer can selectively bind and retain chloride under conditions that mimic the pH, transit times, and ionic content of various compartments of the GI tract. The marked binding capacity and selectivity for chloride observed with veverimer in vitro translates into in vivo pharmacological effects. Removal of acid by veverimer results in a dose-dependent increase in mean serum bicarbonate, as observed in rats with adenine-induced nephropathy and low serum bicarbonate. A significant increase in fecal chloride relative to controls suggests that veverimer retained its functional integrity during transit through the rat GI tract. This study in an animal model of CKD illustrated the potential of veverimer to correct depleted serum bicarbonate levels, the hallmark of metabolic acidosis.
Safety pharmacology assessments of the central nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and GI systems did not identify any veverimer-related adverse effects at oral doses up to 4 g/kg (central nervous system, respiratory) and up to 2 g/kg (GI) in rats and at 2 g/kg (cardiovascular) in dogs.
Lack of veverimer absorption from the GI tract was demonstrated in both rats and dogs administered a single oral dose of radiolabeled [ 14 C]-veverimer. Because radioactivity was not observed in the plasma of either species, metabolism was not evaluated. The lack of absorption, in conjunction with the in vivo pharmacology study in rats, supports that veverimer is not metabolized or degraded but maintains functional, and therefore, structural integrity during transit through the GI tract following oral administration. The results of the radiolabeled veverimer absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, or ADME, studies demonstrating a lack of oral bioavailability is consistent with the physicochemical properties of veverimer (insolubility in aqueous and organic solvents, particle size averaging 100 micrometers in diameter, and particle stability).
Repeat-dose, GLP toxicology studies of up to 26 weeks duration in rats and 39 weeks duration in dogs demonstrated that veverimer has a very low order of toxicity and was well tolerated. There were no effects on male or female reproductive organs and local GI tolerance was good. The no observed adverse effect level, or NOAEL, in both the rat and dog in the chronic toxicity studies was the highest dose of 2 g/kg/day; this dose of veverimer is 13-fold higher than the highest proposed human dose of 9 g/day (0.15 g/kg/day based on a 60-kg patient). We also established that the polymer has no effect on the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as A, D2, D3, and E. Reproductive toxicity studies indicate there are no adverse veverimer-related effects on maternal reproductive function. We are currently discussing the embryofetal development and teratogenicity data with the FDA with respect to pregnancy label language. We do not expect these discussions to lead to any change in the pregnancy risk statement in the anticipated label due to the non-absorbed nature of veverimer. Veverimer was not mutagenic or clastogenic when evaluated in genotoxicity studies. Given the non-absorbed nature of veverimer, we were granted a waiver from FDA for fertility and early embryonic development (Segment I) and peri/postnatal development (Segment III) reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity studies.
Drug-drug Interaction Studies
As part of our NDA filing, we submitted data evaluating the potential for drug-drug interactions, or DDIs, to occur with veverimer. Veverimer is not systemically absorbed; therefore, its potential for DDIs is limited to those that occur in the GI tract (i.e., direct binding or indirect effects resulting from transient increases in gastric pH). We assessed the potential for DDIs with veverimer both in vitro and in vivo in healthy subjects. 
In vitro binding to veverimer was evaluated with 16 drugs of varying molecular weight and charge. Human DDI studies were conducted with the 2 drugs (furosemide, aspirin) that showed the most in vitro binding to veverimer. The effect of veverimer on gastric pH was measured continuously in vivo in healthy subjects using a microelectrode pH probe placed in the gastric compartment. Human DDI studies were conducted with 3 orally administered drugs with pH-dependent solubility (dabigatran, furosemide, warfarin).
Veverimer did not bind to any of the positively charged, neutral or zwitterionic drugs tested in vitro. It bound to 3 small (Molecular Weight <332 Da), negatively charged drugs (aspirin, ethacrynic acid, furosemide); these interactions were reduced or eliminated in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of chloride. We tested aspirin and furosemide in vivo in human DDI studies conducted in healthy volunteers and these drugs showed a change in exposure of < 20% when co-administered with veverimer.
Veverimer increased gastric pH by approximately 3 and 1.5 pH units in fasted and fed subjects, respectively. The increase in gastric pH was short-lived, with a peak within 1 hour after dosing and a return to baseline after approximately 1.5 hours and approximately 3 hours under fasting and fed conditions, respectively. The effect of veverimer on gastric pH was similar in the presence and absence of omeprazole. The bioavailability of orally administered drugs that are weak acids and weak bases can be affected by changes in gastric pH. Therefore, the clinical relevance of the transient increase in gastric pH caused by veverimer was evaluated in vivo in human DDI studies conducted in healthy volunteers using three drugs with pH-dependent solubility: furosemide (weak acid), dabigatran (weak base) and warfarin (weak acid). These drugs showed a change in exposure of < 20% when co-administered with veverimer.
Based on the results of our DDI studies, we do not believe we need to recommend dosing separation for co-administered drugs with veverimer, either due to direct binding interactions or due to pH sensitivity. We believe it is reasonable to propose dosing instructions for veverimer that do not include any dose separation recommendations for 
other oral medications. However, ultimate label instructions regarding co-administration of veverimer with other oral medications will be subject to FDA review and approval.
Veverimer Regulatory Pathway and Confirmatory Postmarketing Trial, VALOR-CKD
Our Development of Veverimer Pursuant to the Accelerated Approval Program
The FDA is reviewing the NDA for veverimer through the Accelerated Approval Program. The FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program allows for drugs for serious conditions that address an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints are used instead of clinical outcomes in some clinical trials. Surrogate endpoints are used when the clinical outcomes might take a very long time to study, or in cases where the clinical benefit of improving the surrogate endpoint, such as controlling blood pressure, is well understood. Clinical trials are needed to show that surrogate endpoints can be relied upon to predict, or correlate with, clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints that have undergone this testing are called validated surrogate endpoints and those are accepted by the FDA as evidence of benefit.
Surrogate endpoints that the FDA determines are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit may be used to support approval, in some cases, but are not yet validated. This is accomplished through the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program, which is intended to provide patients with serious diseases more rapid access to promising therapies. Because such surrogate endpoints have not been validated, sponsors relying on them are generally required to verify the predicted clinical benefit of their products with confirmatory postmarketing clinical trials.
Veverimer is currently under review for approval pursuant to the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Program based upon meeting the following three criteria:
•Treatment of a Serious Condition: There is evidence that the progression of CKD to ESRD is a serious condition and the chronic treatment of metabolic acidosis may slow the progression of CKD.
•Meaningful Advantage over Available Therapy: There is an unmet need for chronic therapies that slow progression to ESRD in patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis. There are no FDA-approved chronic treatments for metabolic acidosis and there exists a large population of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. 
•Demonstrates an Effect on an Endpoint That Is Reasonably Likely to Predict Clinical Benefit: There are a number of prospective and retrospective studies that show that serum bicarbonate is an appropriate surrogate endpoint and that increasing serum bicarbonate is reasonably likely to predict slowing of progression of CKD.
Our TRCA-301 Phase 3 trial serves as the pivotal trial in our NDA submission for veverimer. 
VALOR-CKD Clinical Trial 
As a condition of filing our NDA pursuant to the Accelerated Approval Program, we have committed to conduct our confirmatory postmarketing trial, VALOR-CKD, which is designed to demonstrate that veverimer provides a clinical benefit (i.e., improves how the patient feels, functions or survives) in addition to increasing serum bicarbonate levels. If we receive FDA approval for veverimer, but do not complete the postmarketing trial with due diligence, or if the postmarketing trial fails to show a clinical benefit of veverimer treatment, the FDA may revoke its approval of veverimer.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we initiated the VALOR-CKD postmarketing trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of veverimer in delaying CKD progression in subjects with metabolic acidosis. 
VALOR-CKD Postmarketing Clinical Trial
The protocol for the VALOR-CKD trial was designed in collaboration with a steering committee of international key opinion leaders in the fields of chronic kidney disease progression and metabolic acidosis and with input from the FDA. It is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of subjects with Stage 3b or 4 CKD (eGFR of 20 to 40 mL/min/1.73m2) and metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate levels of 12 to 20 mEq/L). The eligibility criteria for the VALOR-CKD trial are similar to those used in our pivotal Phase 3 trial, TRCA-301. Based on observations from the TRCA-301 trial, we have strengthened the screening requirements in the VALOR-CKD trial to enable enrollment of subjects with confirmed metabolic acidosis at baseline. Subjects will be treated with veverimer (3, 6 or 9 g QD) or placebo, with titration to attempt to maintain serum bicarbonate in the normal range (22 to 29 mEq/L).
The primary endpoint of the VALOR-CKD trial compares the time to first renal event, with a renal event defined as a ≥ 40% reduction in eGFR, progressing to ESRD, or renal death, in veverimer-treated subjects versus subjects in the placebo group. Subjects will be followed in the trial until the independent blinded Clinical Endpoint Committee has positively adjudicated the targeted number of primary endpoint events, which we estimate will be approximately four years following full enrollment. Based on the magnitude of the increase in serum bicarbonate observed in our pivotal Phase 3 trial, TRCA-301, and the inverse relationship between serum bicarbonate and risk of renal events described by the Predictive MA Model, we have determined that randomizing 1,600 subjects to veverimer or placebo in a 1:1 ratio will result in 90% power to show a 30% to 35% reduction in renal events in the VALOR-CKD trial.
The VALOR-CKD protocol specifies that a blinded event rate interim analysis may be performed two years after the last subject is randomized and is designed to enable an increase in the size of the trial based on total number of events at the time of the blinded interim analysis. The protocol also specifies an interim analysis may be performed when at least half of the planned number of primary endpoint events have occurred. At such time, the trial may be stopped early for efficacy, the sample size may be increased, or the trial may continue without changes. We estimate that the interim analysis may occur when all patients have been on treatment for approximately two to three years.
We plan to complete the VALOR-CKD trial after the FDA’s review of our NDA for veverimer and potential approval of veverimer. VALOR-CKD is a time-to-event study, and we estimate it will take approximately 4 years after randomization is complete to accrue the number of events necessary to complete the study. Assuming successful completion of the VALOR-CKD trial, we plan to file a supplemental NDA, or sNDA, that incorporates results from the VALOR-CKD trial.
Market Opportunity 
We estimate that there are approximately 3 million patients in the United States afflicted with metabolic acidosis and Stage 3 to 5 non-dialysis CKD and that approximately 1.1 million of such patients are under the care of a physician. Our initial target market will be focused on the approximately 600,000 patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD that are under the care of a nephrologist. We have identified approximately 5,000 nephrologists who treat approximately 80% of these patients. Given the demographics of the CKD patient population, these nephrologists are geographically concentrated on the west coast, the northeast and the southeast of the United States. 
We have conducted multiple surveys of practicing nephrologists designed to understand their knowledge of the link between treating metabolic acidosis and the slowing of CKD progression. In a survey of 100 nephrologists, conducted in 2019, we found that over 80% believed that treating metabolic acidosis was moderately, very or extremely important to slow kidney disease progression.
We have also conducted multiple surveys of practicing nephrologists to quantify the expected market for veverimer, if approved. In a survey of 100 nephrologists, conducted in 2019, 79% indicated that they would definitely or probably 
prescribe veverimer, based on a veverimer target product profile which included information from the results of our TRCA-301E clinical trial that were published in The Lancet in June 2019. 
We have also evaluated, through health and economic outcomes analyses, the potential savings to third-party payers and health benefits that could be derived through the treatment of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD. In 2019, we completed a retrospective health economic study of pre-dialysis patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD. The study evaluated renal outcome events and healthcare costs for 51,558 pre-dialysis patients with Stage 3 to 5 CKD derived from electronic health records, or EHRs, and corresponding medical claims from a national de-identified electronic medical record dataset over a 10-year period (2007 to 2017). The results of the study showed the following health impacts of metabolic acidosis over a 2-year period: 
•3 times higher likelihood of death: 31% of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD at baseline died versus 10% of patients with CKD with normal serum bicarbonate at baseline; 
•3.6 times higher likelihood of starting dialysis: 18% of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD at baseline started dialysis versus 5% of patients with CKD with normal serum bicarbonate at baseline; and 
•1.5 times higher likelihood to progress by 1 or more CKD stages: 38% of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD at baseline progressed 1 or more stages of CKD versus 25% of patients with CKD with normal serum bicarbonate at baseline.
In addition, the results of the study showed that healthcare costs were approximately $40 thousand per patient per year higher for patients with metabolic acidosis versus patients that had normal serum bicarbonate levels. The results of the study also suggest that each 1 mEq/L increase in serum bicarbonate can be associated with a 7% decrease in monthly all-cause healthcare costs (p<0.0001). The potential savings to payers and health benefits derived through these analyses were independent of the patient’s status with regard to CKD stage, albumin-to-creatine ratio, sex, age, race, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension or Charlson Comorbidity Score (an index of comorbidity burden).
Due to the absence of an FDA-approved product for chronic metabolic acidosis, we cannot model a treated versus untreated population for these health economic studies. As such, we relied on evaluating similar patient populations, contrasting those with metabolic acidosis and those with a normal serum bicarbonate level.
Additionally, we have conducted multiple surveys of third-party payers representing healthcare coverage for over 200 million U.S. lives. Based on our surveys, as the first and only potential FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of metabolic acidosis and slowing of kidney disease progression in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with CKD, we believe the majority of third-party payers will provide coverage for veverimer, which may be subject to prior authorization and/or other forms of utilization management. We also plan to offer veverimer through both retail and specialty-pharmacy providers to help ensure appropriate physician support and patient access to therapy. In addition, we have evaluated the healthcare insurance coverage mix of our target patient population and we estimate that the majority of these patients will have healthcare insurance coverage through 1) Medicaid programs, Medicare with low-income subsidy programs or Veterans Administration/Department of Defense programs which typically cover prescriptions with a low co-pay obligation for patients or 2) a commercial healthcare insurance plan where we typically can provide co-pay assistance to patients.
Given the high unmet need for an FDA-approved chronic treatment for patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD, the broad understanding among nephrologists that treatment of metabolic acidosis can slow CKD progression, the favorable response from nephrologists to veverimer’s target product profile, the potential health and economic benefits from treating metabolic acidosis, and our survey results which suggest that health insurers are open to providing coverage for veverimer, we believe that there is a significant opportunity for veverimer in the United States, if approved, as the first and only FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of metabolic acidosis and slowing of kidney disease progression in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with CKD. 
In addition, we believe there is a significant market opportunity for veverimer outside the United States, if approved. We intend to seek one or more partners with international sales expertise who can obtain regulatory approval and sell veverimer in target markets. We anticipate that, in certain markets, additional clinical trials of veverimer may be required to obtain regulatory approval and/or ensure market access.
Commercial Strategy and Plan
We plan to initially focus our commercial launch of veverimer, if approved, on a subset of 5,000 nephrologists in the United States who care for approximately 80% of the 600,000 patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD seen by nephrologists. In anticipation of our potential approval, we have hired our commercial leadership team and initiated our disease awareness campaign. 
In 2019 we expanded our disease awareness campaign with a major presence at the 2019 American Society of Nephrology ASN Kidney Week meeting, where we interacted with over 1,000 attendees. We also initiated extensive disease awareness outreach to engage with nephrologists through our MetabolicAcidosisInsights.com website, sponsoring disease-related publications, and our Neph+ app, which provides easy access to publicly available kidney disease treatment guidelines, commonly used calculations for kidney disease and other informational resources for nephrologists. 
We plan to hire a specialty sales force of approximately 80 to 90 individuals whom we plan to deploy in mid-2020 to further our disease awareness efforts and, subject to approval, detail veverimer to our target market of 5,000 nephrologists. Our comprehensive disease awareness and education campaign is designed to communicate the existing evidence that increasing serum bicarbonate in patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD slows the progression of CKD and can potentially improve how patients feel and function. We believe the broad understanding of this evidence will help to establish and increase the urgency to treat patients with this serious condition.
If veverimer is approved, we plan to engage with nephrologists through multiple communication channels to provide them with the veverimer prescribing information and appropriate supplemental marketing materials to augment that information. This will include branded materials for distribution to nephrologists, a branded website, a nephrologist-focused digital marketing campaign, participation in congresses and nephrology-focused events, and speaker programs that educate nephrologists on current disease knowledge and treatment options.
We are currently engaging with third-party payers to seek favorable coverage for veverimer, if approved. In 2018 and 2019, we presented information about the design and results of our health economic study and shared veverimer clinical trial data in three separate third-party payer forums: 1) through an in-person survey involving 15 third-party payers covering over 200 million patient lives, 2) through a Payer Working Group Meeting involving four third-party payers representing over 150 million lives and 3) through face-to-face individual meetings with 34 third-party payers representing approximately 220 million lives. Health insurance payers have indicated their perception of the likelihood of veverimer coverage is influenced by the following potential attributes of veverimer: first and only FDA-approved treatment, disease modifying, safe and efficacious and significant direct healthcare cost savings. We have hired a team of 12 market access professionals to continue appropriate engagement with third-party payers. We are proactively targeting third-party payers that represent 95% of covered lives in the United States. Our goal is to meet with approximately 100 third-party payers in the United States prior to the PDUFA goal date for veverimer of August 22, 2020. 
We plan to engage in scientific exchange with nephrologists through our Medical Affairs team. We have trained and plan to deploy our MSL team at the end of March 2020, concurrent with the National Kidney Foundation Spring Meeting. We intend to increase the size of our team of MSLs to 20 in 2020.
A number of peer-reviewed publications will provide support for our disease awareness campaign and the launch of veverimer, if approved. In 2019, the results of our TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E were published in The Lancet (March 2019 and June 2019). A compilation of the clinical evidence that treatment of metabolic acidosis slows CKD progression was published in Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (Goraya and Wesson, 2019) and a meta-analysis of the effects of treatment of metabolic acidosis in CKD was published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, or CJASN (Navaneethan et al., 2019). A critical assessment of the data related to clinical effects of sodium from sodium chloride versus sodium bicarbonate in patients with CKD-induced metabolic acidosis was published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases, or AJKD (Bushinsky, 2019). A review of the mechanisms underlying metabolic acidosis-induced kidney damage in CKD was published in the Journal of American Society of Nephrology, or JASN (Wesson et al., 2020). Six presentations reporting veverimer mechanism of action and clinical data as well as health economics and clinical outcomes research related to metabolic acidosis were reported at the 2019 ASN Kidney Week Meeting. 
Manufacturing
Veverimer drug substance is a room-temperature stable, free flowing powder, composed of low-swelling, polymeric beads, approximately 100 micrometers in diameter. As a non-absorbed polymeric drug, veverimer is designed to be insoluble in water and organic solvents, and is characterized by its desired function, including high hydrochloric acid 
binding capacity and selectivity, and physical properties, such as minimal swelling. Characterization of the isolated intermediate and careful control of each process step define the structure of the polymer. Because the process to manufacture veverimer fundamentally defines the key polymer attributes for safety and efficacy, the process has been carefully monitored and optimized during scale-up.
Veverimer is manufactured using an efficient two-step process. This two-step approach enables, in step one, the preparation of a crosslinked polymer having a high binding capacity, and in step two, further crosslinking for low swelling and selectivity for hydrochloric acid binding.
The resulting veverimer drug substance is converted into drug product by filling it into packets without the addition of excipients. Veverimer drug product is stored at room temperature. Stability studies demonstrated that veverimer is stable at room temperature for at least 12 months, and we are conducting registration stability studies that we anticipate will enable us to indicate on our label, if approved, that veverimer is stable at room temperature for up to 24 months.
We contract with third-party service providers to manufacture veverimer drug substance and veverimer drug product and to perform analytical testing services. We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We developed the process to manufacture veverimer drug substance in-house and have successfully transferred it to three manufacturers. We believe that there are a limited number of experienced contract manufacturers in the world capable of manufacturing a polymeric drug substance such as veverimer. We currently rely on Patheon Austria GmbH & Co KG, or Patheon, a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., as our sole supplier for drug substance manufacturing and we have used two suppliers for drug product manufacturing. We entered into a multi-year Manufacturing and Commercial Supply Agreement with Patheon in October 2019. Patheon has agreed to manufacture and supply us with veverimer to support our commercialization efforts and clinical needs. We intend to initially commercialize with a single supplier for drug substance and a single supplier for drug product. Our business plan assumes that we will establish a regionally diverse and volume-appropriate portfolio of third-party manufacturers to reduce our dependency on single suppliers for drug substance and drug product in the future. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials for the commercial manufacture of veverimer if it is approved by regulatory authorities.
We are validating the veverimer drug substance manufacturing process at Patheon to produce veverimer in a batch size of approximately 700 kg. In addition, we have manufactured sufficient amounts of drug substance to support our confirmatory post marketing trial, VALOR-CKD, for the next 12 months and to support the anticipated commercial demands for veverimer for the next 12 months, if approved. 
Polymeric-based drugs like veverimer generally require large quantities of drug substance, as compared to small molecule drugs. Accordingly, we will require larger scale and/or multiple manufacturers of drug substance and drug product in order to manufacture sufficient quantities of veverimer to meet our anticipated market demand. We believe that our current production process can be optimized to meet our anticipated commercial needs without introducing changes to key veverimer properties, including binding capacity, selectivity for hydrochloric acid and non-absorption. We use acid binding, competitive anion binding and particle size measurement assays to confirm these properties. The scale of the first step in our drug substance manufacturing process, step one, is approximately 640 kg, and the scale of the second step in our drug substance manufacturing process, step two, is approximately 700 kg. We are continuing to work with our current manufacturer to further optimize and scale our drug substance manufacturing process with the intention of achieving additional manufacturing capacity as well as working to secure a second manufacturer of drug substance. 
Our third-party service providers, their facilities and the veverimer used in our clinical trials or for commercial sale are required to be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and packaging containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The facilities manufacturing and testing our products must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy FDA or other authorities before any product is approved and before we can manufacture commercial products. Our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of veverimer to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties. These actions could have a material impact on the availability of veverimer. Contract manufacturers at times encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, manufacturing and process discoveries, and other know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, trademark protection and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Veverimer was discovered by us utilizing our proprietary technology. We have filed several non-provisional and provisional patent applications, all owned by us, relating to veverimer in the United States, certain foreign countries, and the World Intellectual Property Organization that are directed to compositions-of-matter, dosage unit forms, methods-of-treatment, medical use, and methods of manufacture.
Our patent portfolio, which is solely owned by us, includes two issued U.S. composition of matter patents (U.S. Patent No. 9,205,107 B2 and No. 9,925,214 B2), four issued U.S. method of treatment patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,993,500 B2, 10,391,118 B2, 10,363,268 B2, and 10,369,169 B1), an issued Australian medical use patent (AU 2014274817 B2), an issued Australian composition of matter patent (AU 2019219800 B1), an issued European medical use patent (EP3 003 327 B1), an issued European composition of matter patent (EP3 287 133 B1), an issued European method of manufacture patent (EP3 229 816 B1), an issued Mexican medical use patent (MX 364785 B), an issued Hong Kong medical use patent (HK 1223288 A1) and an issued Japanese medical use patent (JP6,453,860 B2). Each of these issued patents is expected to expire in 2034 (with the exception of EP3 229 816 B1, which is expected to expire in 2035), excluding any additional term resulting from patent term extension if the appropriate maintenance fees are paid.
In addition, we solely own other patent applications relating to veverimer (for example, composition of matter, dosage unit form, method-of-treatment, medical use and method of manufacture patent applications, where applicable) that are currently pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Russia, and the United States. Certain of these patent applications are also pending in Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan. These currently pending patent applications, if they mature into issued patents in one or more of such jurisdictions, are expected to expire between 2034 and 2038, if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other government fees are paid.
Additional patent term for the presently-issued or later-issued patents may be awarded on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. For example, additional patent term for U.S. patents may be awarded as a result of the patent term extension provision of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act. In the European Union member countries, a supplementary protection certificate, if obtained, provides a maximum five years of market exclusivity. In Japan, the term of a patent may be extended by a maximum of five years in certain circumstances. 
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the USPTO delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
We also protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or other contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us.
Research and Development
We are conducting development activities to support our NDA for veverimer and manufacturing of commercial supply of veverimer. We invested $133.0 million, $85.6 million and $35.9 million in research and development for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our development experience, commercialization expertise and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions and others.
Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly than veverimer, or they may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.
There are no therapies approved by the FDA for the chronic treatment of metabolic acidosis, and we are not aware of any active clinical development programs other than ours for a treatment in the United States. The FDA has approved generic intravenous sodium bicarbonate solutions for the treatment of acute metabolic acidosis which may occur in severe renal disease, uncontrolled diabetes, and certain other disorders accompanied by a significant loss of bicarbonate; however, those therapies are used for short-term, hospital-based treatments and are not used in clinical practice to treat chronic metabolic acidosis. For many nephrologists, first-line management of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD is to recommend a protein-restrictive diet. Retrospective analyses show that 3% to 15.0% of patients with metabolic acidosis and CKD use oral alkali supplementation, such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate or, less frequently, potassium citrate. These supplements have not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metabolic acidosis.
Government Regulation
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, postmarketing monitoring and reporting, and import and export of drug products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and implementing regulations. These laws and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, postmarketing monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of drug products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending regulatory applications, 
warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for a new product;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection, if conducted, of the facility or facilities where the product candidate is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency;
•potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites;
•potential FDA inspection of us and vendors involved in the generation of the data in support of the NDA; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA.
Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidate or disease. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific trials or all trials conducted under the IND.
Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product candidate’s chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product candidate’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The trial protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must also be submitted to an ethics committee/institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An ethics committee/IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the ethics committee/IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the product candidate is usually into healthy human subjects, and the product candidate is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects 
associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the product candidate for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a product candidate demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the product candidate and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product candidate. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate. A single Phase 3 trial may be sufficient in certain circumstances.
A drug product candidate being studied in clinical trials may be made available for treatment of individual patients, in certain circumstances. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational product for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational product.
During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points; specifically, prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support the approval of the new product candidate.
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf life. After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product candidate’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to annual prescription drug program fees. These fees are typically increased annually. On August 3, 2017, Congress passed the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or FDARA, which reauthorizes the various user fees to facilitate the FDA’s product review and oversight.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and the resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review product candidates are reviewed within ten months of the date the FDA files the NDA; most applications for priority review product candidates are reviewed within six months of the date the FDA files the NDA. Priority review can be applied to a product candidate that the FDA determines has the potential to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would be a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available therapies. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. This late-submitted information is typically requested by FDA.
Among other things, the FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may also refer applications for novel product candidates, or product candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA may inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. To assure GCP and cGMP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditures of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive. The FDA may disagree with our trial design or interpret data from nonclinical studies and clinical trials differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the application identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug in the United States with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. In addition, the FDA may require confirmatory postmarketing trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Foreign Clinical Studies to Support an IND or NDA
The FDA will accept as support for an IND or NDA a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign clinical trial if it was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data from the trial through an on-site inspection, if necessary. A sponsor or applicant who wishes to rely on a non-IND foreign clinical trial must submit supporting information to the FDA to demonstrate that the trial conformed to GCP.
Regulatory applications based solely on foreign clinical data meeting these criteria may be approved if the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, the trials have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by FDA or, if FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Failure of an application to meet any of these criteria may result in the application not being approvable based on the foreign data alone.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track Designation, Priority Review Designation, Accelerated Approval Program and Breakthrough Therapy Designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing product candidates. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may 
later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be lengthened. Generally, product candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track Designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of product candidates to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority Review Designation is designed to give a product candidate that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness, an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of within ten months of the date the FDA files the NDA.
Although Fast Track Designation and Priority Review Designation do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track Designation product candidate and expedite review of the application for a Priority Review Designation product candidate.
In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was signed into law in July 2012, the U.S. Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of product candidates under the Accelerated Approval Program. The law required the FDA to issue related guidance and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. In May 2014, the FDA published a final Guidance for Industry titled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics,” which provides guidance on the FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new product candidates as well as threshold criteria generally applicable to concluding that a product candidate is a candidate for these expedited development and review programs.
In addition to the Fast Track Designation and Priority Review Designation Programs discussed above, the FDA also provided guidance on a new program for Breakthrough Therapy Designation, established by FDASIA to subject a new category of product candidates to expedited approval. A sponsor may seek Breakthrough Therapy Designation of a product candidate if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other therapeutics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A request for Breakthrough Therapy Designation should be submitted concurrently with, or as an amendment to, an IND, but ideally no later than the End-of-Phase 2 meeting.
Accelerated Approval Program
Under the accelerated approval provisions of the FFDCA and the FDA’s implementing regulations, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Products approved through the Accelerated Approval Program must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
The Accelerated Approval Program is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, while the effect on the surrogate endpoint occurs more rapidly. The FDA will not grant approval through the Accelerated Approval Program to products that meet standards for traditional approval.
The evidence to support the determination that an endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit may include epidemiological, pathophysiological, therapeutic, pharmacologic, or other evidence developed using biomarkers, for example, or other scientific methods or tools. The FDA considers all relevant evidence and may consult external experts, as needed. Important factors for the agency’s consideration include the disease process and the relationship between the drug’s effect and the disease process.
Approval through the Accelerated Approval Program is subject, however, to the requirement that the applicant conduct additional postmarketing clinical trials to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit, where there is uncertainty as to the relationship of the surrogate endpoint to the clinical benefit, or of the observed clinical endpoint to ultimate outcome. Typically, clinical benefit is verified when postmarketing clinical trials show that the drug provides a clinically meaningful positive therapeutic effect, that is, an effect on how a patient feels, functions, or survives. The FDA may require that any confirmatory postmarketing trial be initiated or substantially underway prior to the submission of an application through the Accelerated Approval Program. And, if such confirmatory postmarketing trial fails to confirm the drug’s clinical profile or risks and benefits, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. The FDA may also withdraw 
the approval if other evidence demonstrates that the product is not safe or effective. All promotional materials for product candidates approved through the Accelerated Approval Program are subject to prior review by the FDA. The FDA has issued labeling instructions specific to the program. For example, if a drug is approved based on a surrogate endpoint through the program, its labeling should include a succinct description of the limitations of usefulness of the drug and any uncertainty about anticipated clinical benefits. False or misleading promotional materials may also lead to expedited withdrawal of approval.
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
After approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch- Waxman Act. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the product’s testing phase-the time between IND and NDA submission-and all of the review phase-the time between NDA submission and approval, up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the product candidate covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a product candidate for which an NDA has not been submitted.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FFDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FFDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A product candidate is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product candidate containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the product candidate substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such product candidate where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FFDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing product candidate. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for product candidates containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Postmarketing Requirements
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may under some circumstances require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA under some circumstances has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarketing programs.
Veverimer, which will be manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals, is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:
•record-keeping requirements;
•reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product;
•providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
•therapeutic sampling and distribution requirements;
•notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes;
•registration and listing requirements; and
•complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.
Manufacturers, their subcontractors, and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of veverimer, if approved, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP, including data integrity requirements, and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers engaged by us if veverimer is approved. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations would also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizures of products, injunctive actions or other civil penalties.
In addition, drug manufacturers in the United States must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities, and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate product.
New Legislation and Regulations
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and veverimer. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (such as the Office of Inspector General and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and anyone in a position to purchase or recommend the product on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, ordering or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify 
for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the PPACA , to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA (discussed below).
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. For instance, historically, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Additionally, to the extent that veverimer may in the future be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
We expect that veverimer, if approved, may be eligible for coverage under Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. In addition, veverimer may be covered and reimbursed under other government programs, such as Medicaid and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in 
the program. As part of the requirements to participate in these government programs, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price. There are penalties for failing to provide timely and accurate price reporting to the government, and the Right Rebate Act (effective April 2019) imposes additional penalties for knowingly misclassifying a covered outpatient drug under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, within the PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to "Covered Recipients", or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, Covered Recipients and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The term Covered Recipients currently includes U.S.-licensed-physicians and teaching hospitals, and, for reports submitted on or after January 1, 2022, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of veverimer, if approved. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of veverimer, if and when we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payers include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, commercial health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payers are critical to new product acceptance.
Our ability to commercialize veverimer successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payer’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan;
•safe, effective and medically necessary;
•appropriate for the specific patient;
•cost-effective; and
•neither experimental nor investigational.
We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for veverimer and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the indications for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, veverimer, if approved.
Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for veverimer may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of veverimer, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Veverimer may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payer is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payer supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of veverimer on a payer-by-payer basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payers and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. It is difficult to predict how Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies will be applied to veverimer in the future and coverage and reimbursement under different federal healthcare programs are not always consistent. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize veverimer.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross- border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of veverimer, if approved, for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to effectively sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, have undertaken efforts to contain healthcare costs, improve quality, and expand patient access to 
healthcare items and services. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
For example, the PPACA substantially changed and continues to impact healthcare financing and delivery by both government payers and private insurers. Among the PPACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price, or AMP, for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and a cap on the total rebate amount for single source and innovator drugs at 100.0% of the product's AMP;
•the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, where as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D program, manufacturers must agree to offer 70.0% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period;
•extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
•expansion of the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 138.0% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
•expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
•a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
•requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;
•a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
•establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending; and
•a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.
There have been legal and judicial, Congressional, and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal and replace certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed at least two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law, including the repeal, effective January 1, 2019, of the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Although two courts have ruled that this repeal renders the individual mandate unconstitutional, this decision is subject to further appeal and the courts are continuing to assess whether this means that the PPACA as a whole is 
unconstitutional. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain third-party providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on nonexempt medical devices. Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50.0% to 70.0% the point-of-sale discount to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In the future, there may be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA. It remains to be seen precisely what new legislation will provide, when it will be enacted, and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, including the cost of pharmaceutical products. 
We anticipate that the PPACA, if substantially maintained in its current form, will continue to result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for veverimer, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize veverimer. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend legislation that would reduce the deficit by at least $1.5 trillion, but at a minimum $1.2 trillion, from fiscal years 2012 to 2021. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not reach an agreement and, as a result, Congress did not enact a “joint committee bill” with the requisite deficit reduction by the law’s deadline, triggering the law’s automatic reductions to several government programs. This includes automatic reductions in Medicare payments for all items and services, including prescription drugs, of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation designed to, among other things, lower drug pricing, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize veverimer, if approved.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic 
Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Other Regulations
We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
European Union/Rest of World Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials, manufacturing and any future commercial sales, promotion and distribution of veverimer. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval to market veverimer, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the products in those countries.
Even if a product obtains FDA marketing approval, most foreign jurisdiction require that the investigational product undergo national requirements related to clinical trials and authorization processes, similar to those in the United States. With respect to clinical trials, certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, much like the IND, prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, before starting a clinical trial, a valid request for authorization must be submitted by the sponsor to the competent authority of the EU Member State(s) in which the sponsor plans to conduct the clinical trial, as well as to independent Ethics Committee(s). A clinical trial may commence only once the relevant Ethics Committee(s) has (have) issued a favorable opinion and the competent authority of the EU Member State(s) concerned has (have) not informed the sponsor of any grounds for non-acceptance. Failure to comply with the EU requirements may subject a company to the rejection of the request and the prohibition to start a clinical trial. Clinical trials conducted in the European Union (or used for marketing authorization application in the European Union) must be conducted in accordance with applicable laws, GCP and GMP rules, International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, guidelines and be consistent with ethical principles. Competent authorities of EU Member States regularly conduct GCP inspections to verify the sponsor’s compliance with applicable rules. The sponsor is required to record all adverse events which are reported to it by investigators and submit, upon request, such records to the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is being conducted. The sponsor is also required to record and report to the relevant national competent authorities and to the Ethics Committee information about suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions (i) as soon as it becomes aware of suspected serious unexpected reactions, and (ii) yearly of all suspected serious unexpected reactions having occurred over the past year and to report on the subjects’ safety.
The authorization of a clinical trial may be suspended or revoked by EU Member States in their territory if the conditions in the request for an authorization are no longer met, or if an EU Member State has information raising doubts about the safety or scientific validity of the clinical trial. Various penalties exist in EU Member States for non-compliance with the clinical trial rules and related requirements, for example with respect to data protection and privacy. If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable EU regulatory requirements, we may also be subject to damage compensation and civil and criminal liability. The way clinical trials are conducted in the European Union will undergo a major change when the new EU Clinical Trial Regulation (Regulation 536/2014) comes into application in 2019.
The way clinical trials are conducted in the European Union will undergo a major change when the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation (Regulation 536/2014) comes into application, according to the European Commission currently expected in late 2021 or 2022. The new Clinical Trials Regulation is aimed at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The new EU Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the EU portal; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different EU Member States. The current regime under the EU Member States’ national legislation implementing the Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC) will, however, still apply three years from the date of entry into 
application of the Clinical Trials Regulation to (i) clinical trials applications submitted before the entry into application and (ii) clinical trials applications submitted within one year after the entry into application if the sponsor opts for old system.
As in the United States, no medicinal product may be placed on the EU market unless a marketing authorization has been issued. Medicinal products may be authorized in different ways in the EU, depending on certain criteria: the national authorization procedure (i.e., via the EU Member States’ national authorization procedure, which later allows for application via the mutual-recognition procedure), the centralized authorization procedure (i.e., at EU level), or the decentralized authorization procedure (i.e., authorization of a product that is not yet authorized in the EU, which can simultaneously be authorized in several EU Member States). Products submitted for approval via the national procedure must follow the national authorization procedures, which vary from Member State to Member State. Products submitted for approval via the centralized procedure (only available and compulsory for certain products and indications; e.g., human medicines containing a new active substance to treat HIV or AIDS, advanced-therapy medicines, and orphan medicines) are assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, a committee within the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. The CHMP assesses, inter alia, whether a medicine meets the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements and whether it has a positive risk-benefit balance. Products submitted for approval via the decentralized procedure, as for the mutual-recognition procedure, must first undergo an assessment performed by one Member State, or reference Member State, which another Member State may approve.
Various penalties and sanctions exist in different EU Member States for non-compliance with the EU marketing authorization procedure. In addition, for centrally authorized products the European Commission may also impose financial penalties on the holders of marketing authorizations if they fail to comply with certain obligations in connection with the authorizations as well as pharmacovigilance rules (a fine up to 5% of the marketing authorization holder’s turnover in the EU in the preceding business year for an infringement; daily penalty payments up to 2,5 % of the marketing authorization holder’s average daily turnover in the EU in the preceding business year, pending cessation of an infringement; and a fine up to 0.5% of the marketing authorization holder’s turnover in the EU in the preceding business year for e.g. failure to cooperate or supply of misleading information to authorities). If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable EU or other foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
As described above, coverage and reimbursement status of veverimer, if approved, are provided for by the national laws of EU Member States. The requirements may differ significantly across the EU Member States. Also, at EU Member State level, actions have been taken to enact transparency laws regarding payments between pharmaceutical companies and health care professionals, or HCPs.
We are subject to European data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR (as implemented by EU Member States and the UK). The GDPR which came into effect on May 25, 2018, establishes requirements applicable to the processing of personal data (i.e., data which identifies an individual or from which an individual is identifiable), affords various data protection rights to individuals (e.g., the right to erasure of personal data) and imposes potential penalties for serious breaches of up to 4.0% annual worldwide turnover or €20 million, whichever is greater. Individuals (e.g., study subjects) also have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses (e.g., distress). The GDPR increases our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and additional mechanisms put in place to address compliance with the GDPR must be kept under review as the legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection in Europe continues to evolve.
For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, privacy and data protection, pricing and reimbursement also vary from country to country.
