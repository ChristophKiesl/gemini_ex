Product Pipeline
Exclusive and Partnered Commercial Products
The following table summarizes our exclusive and partnered commercial products and is followed by detailed descriptions of each product:
INGREZZA (valbenazine)
We launched INGREZZA in the U.S. in May 2017, after receiving FDA approval for INGREZZA as the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in April 2017. INGREZZA provides a once-daily dosing treatment option for tardive dyskinesia and has two dosing options (40 mg and 80 mg capsules), with 40 mg taken for the first seven days of treatment and an option to take 40 mg or 80 mg thereafter, depending on the patient’s dosing needs.
In February 2021, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharmaceutical Company, or MTPC, reported positive top-line results from the J-KINECT Phase III study, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of valbenazine in tardive dyskinesia. Detailed results from this trial will be presented at a future medical conference. With positive data in hand, a marketing authorization with the Ministry of Health and Welfare is planned for 2021 in Japan. In addition, MTPC submitted filings for marketing authorizations in South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia in 2020.
Tardive dyskinesia is defined by hyperkinetic involuntary movements which arise after months or years of treatment with dopamine receptor blocking agents, such as antipsychotics used for treating schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, and certain treatments for nausea, vomiting and gastric emptying in patients with gastroparesis. While the prevalence rates of tardive dyskinesia can vary greatly in accordance with the population being studied, it is estimated that over 500 thousand individuals are affected by tardive dyskinesia in the U.S. alone (Kantar Health).
INGREZZA net product sales totaled $993.1 million, $752.9 million and $409.6 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and represented the significant majority of our total net product sales for 2020 and all of our net product sales for 2019 and 2018.
ONGENTYS (opicapone)
We launched ONGENTYS in the U.S. in September 2020, after receiving FDA approval for ONGENTYS as an adjunctive therapy to levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors in adult Parkinson's disease patients in April 2020. We acquired the U.S. and Canada rights to ONGENTYS from BIAL – Portela & Ca, S.A., or BIAL, in the first quarter of 2017. 
ONGENTYS is a novel, once-daily, peripherally acting, highly selective Catechol-O-methyltransferase, or COMT, inhibitor utilized as an adjunct therapy to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson’s disease experiencing motor fluctuations. COMT inhibitors are utilized to prolong the duration of effect of levodopa, the primary treatment option for Parkinson’s disease patients, during periods of the day where the effects of levodopa wear off and motor symptoms worsen, also referred to as “off-time.” Parkinson’s disease is a chronic and progressive movement disorder that affects approximately 1 million individuals in the U.S. alone.
ORILISSA (elagolix)
AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie, launched ORILISSA in the U.S. and Canada in August and November 2018, respectively, after receiving FDA and Health Canada approval for ORILISSA for the management of moderate to severe endometriosis pain in women in July and October 2018, respectively. Discovered and developed through Phase II clinical studies by us, we out-licensed the global rights to elagolix to AbbVie in 2010. 
The World Endometriosis Research Foundation estimates that there are over 170 million women worldwide who suffer from endometriosis, including approximately 7.5 million women in the U.S. alone.
ORIAHNN (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate; elagolix)
AbbVie launched ORIAHNN in the U.S. in June 2020, after receiving FDA approval for ORIAHNN as the first FDA-approved non-surgical, oral medication option for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women in May 2020. We out-licensed the global rights to elagolix to AbbVie in 2010.
Uterine fibroids are benign hormonally responsive tumors that form in the wall of the uterus with a prevalence rate of at least 25% (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) and are a leading indication for hysterectomy in the U.S., with approximately 250,000 hysterectomies performed each year related to uterine fibroids (Whiteman et al AJOG 2008, 198, e1).
Clinical Development Pipeline
The following table summarizes our clinical development pipeline and is followed by detailed descriptions of each program:
Neurology
valbenazine – VMAT2 Inhibitor
VMAT2 is a protein concentrated in the human brain that is essential for the transmission of nerve impulses between neurons. VMAT2 is primarily responsible for packaging and transporting monoamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine) in neurons. Specifically, dopamine enables neurotransmission among nerve cells that are involved in voluntary and involuntary motor control. Disease states such as tardive dyskinesia, Tourette syndrome, Huntington’s chorea, schizophrenia, and tardive dystonia are characterized in part by a hyperdopaminergic state in the brain, and modulation of neuronal dopamine levels may provide symptomatic benefits for patients with these conditions, among others.
We are currently conducting the KINECT-HD study, a Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center Phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of valbenazine for the treatment of chorea in 120 patients with Huntington’s disease, or HD, with Phase III top-line data expected in the fourth quarter of 2021.
HD is a hereditary progressive neurodegenerative disorder, in which neurons within the brain break down, resulting in motor, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. Symptoms generally appear between the ages of 30 to 50 and worsen over a 10 to 25-year period. Many patients with HD experience chorea, a troublesome involuntary movement disorder, in which patients develop abnormal, abrupt or irregular movements. Chorea can affect various body parts, and interfere with speech, swallowing, posture and gait. HD is estimated to affect approximately 30,000 adults in the U.S., with more than 200,000 at risk of inheriting the disease (NORD).
NBI-921352 (XEN901) – Nav1.6 Sodium Channel Inhibitor
NBI-921352 is a potent, highly selective Nav1.6 sodium channel inhibitor being developed to treat pediatric patients with SCN8A-DEE and other potential indications, including adult focal epilepsy.
The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of NBI-921352 have been evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I study using a powder-in-capsule formulation of NBI-921352 in healthy adult subjects. 
Xenon has developed a pediatric-specific, granule formulation of NBI-921352, and completed juvenile toxicology studies to support pediatric development activities.
In October 2020, the FDA requested additional non-clinical data to support the IND we submitted in August 2020 in support of a Phase II clinical study for NBI-921352 in patients with SCN8A-DEE. Based on feedback received in January 2021, we plan to initiate a Phase II clinical study in adolescent patients (aged 12 years and older) with SCN8A-DEE in the third quarter of 2021, and the study protocol will be amended to include younger pediatric patients (aged 2-11 years) with SCN8A-DEE as soon as the FDA has reviewed and approved additional non-clinical information. We are also advancing clinical plans to initiate a Phase II clinical study of NBI-921352 for the treatment of adult focal epilepsy in 2021. In addition, in October 2020, we announced the FDA granted us Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for NBI-921352 for the treatment of SCN8A-DEE.
SCN8A-DEE is a rare, extremely severe, single-gene epilepsy caused by mutations in the SCN8A gene that activates Nav1.6, the most highly expressed sodium channel in the excitatory pathways of the central nervous system, or CNS. Children born with SCN8A-DEE typically start experiencing seizures between birth and 18 months of age, and most have multiple seizures per day. Other symptoms include learning difficulties, muscle spasms, low or high muscle tone, poor coordination, developmental delay, and features similar to autism. An estimated 10% of people with SCN8A are reported to have experienced sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. The prevalence of SCN8A-DEE is estimated to be 1% of all developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (Larsen et al, Neurology 2015, 84, 480). As SCN8A mutations were discovered only recently (i.e., in 2012), the number of SCN8A-DEE cases is expected to increase as awareness of and access to genetic surveillance increases. SCN8A-DEE is generally refractory to anti-epilepsy treatments.
We are developing NBI-921352 with Xenon Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Xenon, as part of a strategic collaboration announced in December 2019.
NBI-827104 (ACT-709478) – T-type Calcium Channel Blocker
We acquired the global rights to NBI-827104 from Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd., or Idorsia, in May 2020. NBI-827104 is a potent, selective, orally active and brain penetrating T-type calcium channel blocker, being developed for the treatment of a rare pediatric epilepsy and other potential indications, including essential tremor.
In November 2020, we initiated a Phase II clinical study for NBI-827104 in a rare pediatric epileptic encephalopathy known as Continuous Spike and Wave During Sleep, or CSWS. CSWS typically impacts children initially between the ages of two and four years old and manifests itself via a variety of seizure types, including atypical absence seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and focal seizures that usually occur during sleep. In addition, children with CSWS often present with cognitive, behavioral and developmental regression or delay. Due to the differentiated mechanism of action of this molecule, when compared to non-selective calcium channel inhibitors, treatment with NBI-827104 could lead to an enhanced benefit risk profile for patients with this rare pediatric form of epilepsy. In parallel we are advancing clinical plans to initiate a Proof of Concept clinical study of NBI-827104 for the treatment of essential tremor in 2021.
Endocrinology
crinecerfont (NBI-74788) – CRF1 Antagonist
Crinecerfont is a potent, selective, orally active, corticotropin-releasing factor1, or CRF1, receptor antagonist as demonstrated in a range of in vitro and in vivo assays. CRF1, is a hypothalamic hormone released directly into the hypophyseal portal vasculature which acts on the CRF1 receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor, or GPCR, in the anterior pituitary to stimulate the release of adrenocorticotropin hormone, or ACTH. The primary role of ACTH is the stimulation of the synthesis and release of adrenal steroids, including cortisol. Cortisol from the adrenals have a negative feedback role at the level of the hypothalamus that decreases CRF1 release as well as at the level of the pituitary to inhibit the release of ACTH. This tight control loop is known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Blockade of CRF1 receptors at the pituitary has been shown to decrease the release of ACTH, which in turn decreases the production of adrenal steroids including androgens, and potentially the symptoms associated with classic CAH. Lower ACTH levels would also reduce the amount of exogenous corticosteroid necessary for classic CAH patients to thrive avoiding the side-effects currently associated with excessive steroid therapy. 
Classic CAH is a group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders that affects approximately 30 thousand people in the U.S. and approximately 50 thousand people in the EU, and results in an enzyme deficiency altering the production of adrenal steroids. Because of this deficiency, the adrenal glands have little to no cortisol biosynthesis resulting in a potentially life-threatening condition. If left untreated, classic CAH can result in salt wasting, dehydration, and eventually death. Even with cortisol replacement, persistent elevation of ACTH from the pituitary gland results in excessive androgen levels leading to virilization of females including precocious puberty, menstrual irregularity, short stature, hirsutism, acne and fertility problems.
Corticosteroids are the current standard of care for classic CAH and are used chronically to both correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency and to reduce the excessive ACTH levels and androgen excess. However, the dose and duration of steroid use required to suppress ACTH is well above the normal physiological level of cortisol; resulting in metabolic syndrome, bone loss, growth impairment, and Cushing’s syndrome as common and serious side effects. We have been granted orphan drug designation for crinecerfont in the treatment of classic CAH in the U.S. and the EU.
In June 2020, positive data from a completed Phase II, open-label, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic clinical study of crinecerfont in adult patients with classic CAH, which assessed key pharmacodynamic biomarkers including ACTH, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), androgen and cortisol levels collected the morning following bedtime dosing on Day 1 and Day 14, demonstrated meaningful reductions in elevated ACTH and 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) levels (by 54% to 75%) at all doses studied, together with a dose-related decrease in androstenedione (A4) levels, ranging from 21% to 64%. At the highest dose of crinecerfont (100 mg twice daily), 75% of patients showed a response of at least 50% reduction from baseline for each of the three hormone markers at day 14. Treatment with crinecerfont was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile with no related serious adverse events reported. Adverse events reported in two or more participants included headache, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, contusion, insomnia and nausea.
In July 2020, we initiated the CAHtalyst study, a global registrational Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of crinecerfont in 165 adult patients with classic CAH, followed by an open-label treatment period. 
In July 2019, we initiated a Phase IIa proof-of-concept, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of crinecerfont in pediatric patients with classic CAH. We plan to initiate a single global registrational Phase III clinical study for crinecerfont in pediatric patients with CAH in 2021.
elagolix – GnRH Antagonist
The gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH, is the endogenous peptide that binds to the GnRH receptor and stimulates the secretion of the pituitary hormones that are responsible for sex steroid production and normal reproductive function. Researchers have found that chronic administration of GnRH agonists, after initial stimulation, reversibly shuts down this transmitter pathway and is clinically useful in treating hormone-dependent diseases such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, or PCOS.
AbbVie initiated a Phase II clinical study of elagolix in patients with PCOS in mid-2019. The study is designed to evaluate whether there is a potential impact on disordered hormonal dynamics in women with PCOS. We out-licensed the global rights to elagolix to AbbVie in 2010.
PCOS is one of the most common hormonal disorders among women of reproductive age, affecting approximately 3.5 million women in the U.S. PCOS occurs when the ovaries or adrenal glands produce more male hormones (androgens) than normal. Women with PCOS experience irregular menstrual periods, infertility, pelvic pain, weight gain, acne and excess hair growth on the face, chest, stomach and thighs. There is no cure for PCOS, and treatment options are limited. If left untreated, PCOS can lead to certain cancers, diabetes and coronary artery disease. 
Psychiatry
We acquired the global rights to develop and commercialize NBI-1065844 (TAK-831), NBI-1065845 (TAK-653) and NBI-1065846 (TAK-041) from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, in June 2020.
NBI-1065844 (TAK-831) – DAAO Inhibitor
NBI-1065844 is a potential first-in-class D-Amino Acid Oxidase, or DAAO, inhibitor that has completed multiple Phase I clinical studies and is currently in on-going Phase II clinical studies, including the Phase II INTERACT proof-of-concept clinical study in negative symptoms of schizophrenia, with Phase II top-line data expected in the first quarter of 2021.
According to the World Health Organization, or WHO, 20 million people across the globe are affected by schizophrenia. In the U.S., the prevalence of schizophrenia is estimated to be approximately 0.6% of the population. The negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia describe a lessening or absence of behaviors and functions related to motivation and interest, or verbal and emotional expression. There are currently no approved treatment options in the U.S. for patients with predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
NBI-1065844 is currently designated as a royalty-bearing product for Takeda. Takeda retains a one-time opt-in right for a 50:50 profit share arrangement upon achievement of a certain development event.
NBI-1065845 (TAK-653) – AMPA Potentiator
NBI-1065845 is a potential first-in-class Alpha-Amino-3-Hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-Isoxazole Propionic Acid, or AMPA, potentiator with the potential to be developed for treatment-resistant depression. NBI-1065845 has completed multiple Phase I clinical studies. We plan to initiate a Phase II clinical study of NBI-1065845 in treatment-resistant depression in 2021.
According to the WHO, major depressive disorder, or MDD, is one of the leading causes of disability. While there are a number of marketed treatments for MDD, approximately 1/3 of patients do not benefit from them. There is a significant need to develop new therapies with improved, faster onset of efficacy that are well tolerated. 
NBI-1065845 is currently designated as a 50:50 profit share product with Takeda. Takeda retains a one-time opt-out right to convert the designation to a royalty-bearing product dependent on a certain development event.
NBI-1065846 (TAK-041) – G Protein-Coupled Receptor 139 Agonist
NBI-1065846 is a potential first-in-class G Protein-Coupled Receptor 139, or GPR139, agonist with the potential to be developed for the treatment of anhedonia in depression. NBI-1065846 has completed multiple Phase I clinical studies. We plan to initiate a Phase II clinical study of NBI-1065846 in anhedonia in 2021.
Anhedonia is a psychological condition characterized by the inability to experience pleasure. In patients with depression, anhedonia often does not improve with current treatments and predicts lack of functional improvement. 
NBI-1065846 is currently designated as a 50:50 profit share product with Takeda. Takeda retains a one-time opt-out right to convert the designation to a royalty-bearing product dependent on a certain development event.
Research Programs
We invest in research and development in order to address diseases and disorders of the central nervous and endocrine systems, which include therapeutic categories ranging from hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal disorders to stress-related disorders and neurological/neuropsychiatric diseases. CNS and endocrinology drug therapies are among the largest therapeutic categories, accounting for over $110 billion in drug sales in the U.S. alone according to IQVIA (2018).
Business Strategy
Our mission is to improve the lives of patients living with serious and under-addressed neurological, neuro-endocrinology and psychiatry related diseases and disorders. The following are the key elements of our business strategy:
Commercializing Our Product Portfolio. In April 2017, we received approval from the FDA for INGREZZA for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. In April 2020, we received FDA approval for ONGENTYS as an adjunctive therapy to levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors in adult Parkinson's disease patients. We market INGREZZA and ONGENTYS in the U.S. The commercial launch of INGREZZA occurred in May 2017 and ONGENTYS occurred in September 2020. We have built a specialty sales force in the U.S. of approximately 250 experienced sales professionals. This specialty sales force focuses on promotion to physicians, primarily psychiatrists and neurologists. Our commercial team is comprised of experienced professionals in marketing, access and reimbursement, managed markets, market research, commercial operations, and sales force planning and management. In addition, our commercial infrastructure includes capabilities in manufacturing, medical affairs, quality control and compliance. We intend to retain commercial rights to certain products, including INGREZZA, that we can effectively and efficiently develop, secure regulatory approval and commercialize, which includes products with a concentrated prescriber base and well-defined patient population that can be accessed with an efficient patient and prescriber outreach program.
Advancing Life-Changing Discoveries in Neurology, Neuro-Endocrinology and Psychiatry. We believe that by continuing to advance and extend our product pipeline, we can mitigate some of the clinical development risks associated with drug development. We currently have multiple programs in various stages of research and development, including symptomatic disease modifying and curative treatments. We take a portfolio approach to managing our pipeline that balances the size of the market opportunities with clear and defined clinical and regulatory paths to approval. By doing so, we focus our internal development resources on innovative therapies with improved probabilities of technical and commercial success.
Discovering Novel Medicines to Address Unmet Patient Needs. We seek to identify and validate new medicines on novel targets for internal development or collaboration. We believe the creativity and productivity of our discovery research group will continue to be a critical component for our ongoing success.
Acquiring Rights to Commercial Products, Drug Development Candidates and Technologies. We plan to continue to selectively acquire rights to programs at all stages of development and commercial products to take advantage of our drug development and commercial capabilities.
Corporate Collaborations and Strategic Alliances
One of our business strategies is to utilize strategic alliances to enhance our development and commercialization capabilities. The following is a summary of our significant collaborations/alliances:
Takeda. In June 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda, which became effective in July 2020, to develop and commercialize certain compounds in Takeda’s early to mid-stage psychiatry pipeline. Specifically, Takeda granted us an exclusive license to the following seven assets: (i) NBI-1065844 (TAK-831) for schizophrenia, (ii) NBI-1065845 (TAK-653) for treatment-resistant depression, (iii) NBI-1065846 (TAK-041) for anhedonia (which together with the NBI-1065845 are referred to as the Phase II Ready Assets), and (iv) four non-clinical stage assets, or the Non-Clinical Assets.
NBI-1065844 is deemed a royalty-bearing product under the license agreement pursuant to which we will be responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the development, manufacture, and commercialization of such asset, subject to certain exceptions, and Takeda will be eligible to receive development and commercial milestones and royalties with respect to such asset, or a Royalty-Bearing Product, and Takeda will retain the right to opt-in to a profit sharing arrangement pursuant to which we and Takeda will equally share in the operating profits and losses related to such asset, subject to certain exceptions, in lieu of receiving milestones and royalties, or a Profit-Share Product. Subject to specified conditions, Takeda may elect to exercise such opt-in right for NBI-1065844 before we initiate a Phase III clinical trial. Each of the Phase II Ready Assets is deemed a Profit-Share Product and Takeda will retain the right to opt-out of the profit-sharing arrangement for such asset pursuant to which such asset would become a Royalty-Bearing Product. Takeda may elect to exercise such opt-out rights with respect to a Phase II 
Ready Asset immediately following the completion of the second Phase II clinical trial for such Phase II Ready Asset. In addition, under certain circumstances related to the development and commercialization activities to be performed by us, Takeda may elect to opt-out of the profit-sharing arrangement for a Profit-Share Product before the initiation of a Phase III clinical trial for such product.
Each of the Non-Clinical Assets will be Royalty-Bearing Products pursuant to which we will be responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the development, manufacture, and commercialization of such assets, subject to certain exceptions.
Unless earlier terminated, the license agreement will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the date on which, (i) for any Royalty-Bearing Product, the royalty term has expired in such country; and (ii) for any Profit-Share Product, for so long as we continue to develop, manufacture, or commercialize such licensed product. We may terminate the license agreement for convenience in its entirety or in one or more (but not all) of the United States, Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, or the Major Markets, on 6 months’ written notice to Takeda (i) with respect to all licensed products prior to the first commercial sale of the first licensed product for which first commercial sale occurs, or (ii) with respect to all licensed products in one or more given target classes, as defined in the agreement, prior to the first commercial sale of the first licensed product in such target class(es) for which first commercial sale occurs.

Takeda may terminate the license agreement, subject to specified conditions, (i) if we challenge the validity or enforceability of certain Takeda intellectual property rights or (ii) on a target class-by-target class basis, in the event that we do not conduct any material development or commercialization activities with respect to any licensed product within such target class for a specified continuous period. Subject to a cure period, either party may terminate the license agreement in the event of any material breach, solely with respect to the target class of a licensed product to which such material breach relates, or in its entirety in the event of any material breach that relates to all licensed products.
Idorsia. We acquired the global rights to NBI-827104 from Idorsia in May 2020. NBI-827104 is a potent, selective, orally active and brain penetrating T-type calcium channel blocker, being developed for the treatment of a rare pediatric epilepsy and other potential indications, including essential tremor. The agreement also included a research collaboration to discover and identify additional novel T-type calcium channel blockers as development candidates. Under the terms of the agreement, we are responsible for all manufacturing, development and commercialization costs of any collaboration product. We may terminate the collaboration and licensing agreement, in its entirety or with respect to a particular compound or development candidate, by providing 90 days’ written notice to Idorsia. Further, in the event a party commits a material breach and fails to cure such material breach within 90 days after receiving written notice thereof, the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement in its entirety immediately upon written notice to the breaching party.
Xenon. In December 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Xenon to identify, research, and develop sodium channel inhibitors, including clinical candidate NBI-921352 and three preclinical candidates, which compounds we will have the exclusive right to further develop and commercialize under the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement.
We will be solely responsible, at our sole cost and expense, for all development and manufacturing of the compounds and any pharmaceutical product that contains a compound, subject to Xenon’s right to elect to co-fund the development of one product in a major indication and thus receive a mid-single digit percentage increase in royalties owed on the net sales of such product in the U.S. If Xenon exercises such option, the parties will share equally all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development of such product in the applicable indication, except costs and expenses that are solely related to the development of such product for regulatory approval outside the U.S.
Unless earlier terminated, the term of the license and collaboration agreement will continue on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the royalty term for such product in such country. Upon the expiration of the royalty term for a particular product and country, the exclusive license granted by Xenon to us with 
respect to such product and country will become fully paid, royalty free, perpetual, and irrevocable. We may terminate the license and collaboration agreement by providing at least 90 days’ written notice, provided that such unilateral termination will not be effective for certain products until we have used commercially reasonable efforts to complete certain specified clinical studies. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach in whole or in part, subject to specified conditions.
Voyager. We entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Voyager, a clinical-stage gene therapy company, which became effective in March 2019. The agreement is focused on the development and commercialization of four programs using Voyager’s proprietary gene therapy platform. The four programs consist of the following: NBIb-1817 for Parkinson’s disease, the Friedreich’s ataxia program and two undisclosed programs.
Pursuant to development plans agreed to by us and Voyager, unless Voyager exercises its co-development and co-commercialization rights as provided for in the agreement, we will be responsible for all development costs. Further, upon the occurrence of a specified event for each program, we will assume responsibility for the development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities of such program.
On February 2, 2021, we notified Voyager of our termination of the NBIb-1817 for Parkinson’s disease program. The effective date of this termination will be August 2, 2021. The termination does not apply to any other development program other than NBIb-1817 for Parkinson’s disease, and our collaboration and license agreement with Voyager will otherwise continue in effect. With respect to the other programs, we may terminate the collaboration and license agreement with Voyager upon 180 days written notice to Voyager prior to the first commercial sale of any collaboration product or upon 1 year after the date of notice if such notice is provided after the first commercial sale of any collaboration product. Unless terminated earlier, the agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the last to expire royalty term with respect to any collaboration product or the last expiration or termination of any exercised co-development and co-commercialization rights by Voyager as provided for in the agreement.
BIAL. We acquired the U.S. and Canada rights to ONGENTYS from BIAL in the first quarter of 2017. We launched ONGENTYS in the U.S. in September 2020, after receiving FDA approval for ONGENTYS as an adjunctive therapy to levodopa/DOPA decarboxylase inhibitors in adult Parkinson's disease patients in April 2020.
Under the terms of the agreement, we are responsible for the commercialization of ONGENTYS in the U.S. and Canada. Further, we rely on BIAL for the commercial supply of ONGENTYS. Upon our written request prior to the estimated expiration of the term of a licensed product, the parties shall negotiate a good faith continuation of BIAL’s supply of such licensed product after the term. After the term, and if BIAL is not supplying a certain licensed product, we shall pay BIAL a trademark royalty based on the net sales of such licensed product.
Upon commercialization of ONGENTYS, we determined certain annual sales forecasts. In the event we fail to meet the minimum sales requirements for a particular year, we would be obligated to pay BIAL an amount equal to the difference between the actual net sales and minimum sales requirements for such year.
Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will continue on a licensed product-by-product and country-by-country basis until a generic product in respect of such licensed product under the agreement is sold in a country and sales of such generic product are greater than a specified percentage of total sales of such licensed product in such country.
Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and does not cure the breach within a specified notice period, or upon the other party’s insolvency. BIAL may terminate the agreement if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to submit a new drug application, or NDA, for a licensed product by a specified date, in the event we fail to meet the minimum sales requirements for any two years, or under certain circumstances involving a change of control of Neurocrine Biosciences. Under certain circumstances where BIAL elects to terminate the agreement in connection with a change of control of Neurocrine Biosciences, BIAL would be obligated to pay us a termination fee. We may terminate the agreement at any time for any reason upon nine months’ written notice to BIAL.
MTPC. In March 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with MTPC for the development and commercialization of INGREZZA for movement disorders in Japan and other select Asian markets.

In May 2020, AbbVie received approval from the FDA for ORIAHNN for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in pre-menopausal women.
Under the terms of the agreement, AbbVie is responsible for all third-party development, marketing, and commercialization costs. We are entitled to a percentage of worldwide sales of GnRH Compounds for the longer of ten years or the life of the related patent rights. AbbVie may terminate the collaboration at its discretion upon 180 days’ written notice to us.
Intellectual Property
We actively seek to protect our products and product candidates and related inventions and improvements that we consider important to our business. We own a portfolio of U.S and non-U.S. patents and patent applications and have licensed rights to a number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications. Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications cover or relate to our products and product candidates, including certain formulations, used to treat particular conditions and methods of administration, drug delivery technologies and delivery profiles and methods of manufacturing.
We own or have licensed rights to the following U.S. patents relating to INGREZZA and our other products and product candidates in our pipeline (in addition to non-U.S. patents and certain patents covering our early-stage product candidates):
•INGREZZA, our highly selective VMAT2 inhibitor for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, is covered by eight issued U.S. patents that are listed in the FDA’s Orange Book and are set to expire between 2027 and 2037. There is also a potential patent term extension of up to an additional two years for U.S. Patent No. 8,039,627, which is currently set to expire in 2029 and is the earliest patent covering valbenazine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient contained in INGREZZA. In Japan and certain other East Asian markets, we are actively pursuing most of the patents corresponding to those listed in the FDA’s Orange Book entry for INGREZZA.
•ONGENTYS, a highly selective COMT inhibitor for Parkinson’s disease, is covered by nine issued U.S. patents that are listed in the FDA’s Orange Book and set to expire between 2026 to 2035 (not including a potential patent term extension of up to an additional four years for one of these patents).

•NBI-1065846, a GPR139 agonist for the treatment of anhedonia in depression, is covered by U.S. Patent No. 9,556,130, among others, which expires in 2035 (not including a potential patent term extension of up to an additional five years).
In addition to the potential patent term extensions referenced above, the products and product candidates in our pipeline may be subject to additional terms of exclusivity that we might obtain by future patent issuances.
Separately, the U.S., the European Union, or EU, and Japan all provide data and marketing exclusivity for new medicinal compounds. If this protection is available, no competitor may use the original applicant’s data as the basis of a generic marketing application during the period of data and marketing exclusivity, which is measured from the date of marketing approval by the FDA or corresponding foreign regulatory authority. This period of exclusivity is generally five years in the U.S., six years in Japan and ten years in the EU, except that for biologics, this period of exclusivity in the U.S. is twelve years under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act. In addition, if granted orphan drug designation, certain of our product candidates, including crinecerfont, may also be eligible for market exclusivity in the U.S. and EU for seven years and ten years, respectively.
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently rely on, and intend to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers for the production of INGREZZA and our product candidates. Raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, and other supplies required for the production of INGREZZA and our product candidates are procured from various third-party manufacturers and suppliers in quantities adequate to meet our needs. Continuing adequate supply of such raw materials and API is assured through our long-term commercial supply and manufacturing agreements with multiple manufacturers and our continued focus on the expansion and diversification of our third-party manufacturing relationships. In addition, under the terms of our agreement with BIAL, we rely on BIAL and its suppliers to supply all drug product for the commercialization of ONGENTYS.
We believe our outsource manufacturing strategy enables us to direct our financial resources to the maximization of our opportunities with INGREZZA and ONGENTYS, investment in our internal R&D programs and expansion of our clinical pipeline through business development opportunities.
Our third-party manufacturers, suppliers and service providers may be subject to routine current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions. We depend on our third-party partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
Our sales force in the U.S. consists of approximately 250 experienced sales professionals focused on educating health care professionals, including psychiatrists and neurologists, who treat patients with tardive dyskinesia and Parkinson’s disease.
For INGREZZA, our customers in the U.S. consist of a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers that deliver INGREZZA to patients by mail and a specialty distributor that distributes INGREZZA primarily to closed-door pharmacies and government facilities. For ONGENTYS, our customers in the U.S. consist primarily of wholesale distributors. We rely on third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the packaging, storage and distribution of INGREZZA and ONGENTYS.
Government Regulation
Our business activities are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. and other countries. Regulation by government authorities in the U.S. and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, distribution, tracking, marketing and sale of our proposed products and in our ongoing research and product development activities. All of our products in development will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In addition, federal and state healthcare laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, without limitation, federal and state fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. We have a comprehensive compliance program designed to ensure our business practices remain compliant.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.
Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and the federal civil monetary penalties law, which prohibit among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed and knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or to avoid or decrease an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
In addition, we may be subject to HIPPA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their privacy and security regulations, which impose certain obligations, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect individually identifiable health information on covered entities subject to HIPPA (i.e., health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers) and their business associates that perform certain services for or on their behalf involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information as we as their covered subcontractors.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable entities to report ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, such obligations will include payments and other transfers of value provided in the previous year to certain other healthcare professionals, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.
Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and additional reporting requirements and regulatory oversight, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Development and Marketing Approval for Products
Preclinical studies generally are conducted in laboratory animals to evaluate the potential safety and efficacy of a product. Drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies to the FDA as a part of an investigational new drug, or IND, application before clinical trials can begin in humans. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three-phase process.

Phase I | Clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile, maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetic properties of the product in human volunteers and for certain products, such as gene therapies, in patients with the target disease.
Phase II | Clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. 
Phase III | Larger, multi-center, comparative clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine safety and efficacy as primary support for regulatory approval by the FDA to market a product candidate for a specific disease. 

The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the U.S. and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Institutional Review Boards, Institutional Ethics Committees, and Data Safety Monitoring Boards also closely monitor the conduct of our trials and may also place holds on our clinical trials or recommend that we voluntarily do so. Clinical trials conducted in foreign countries are also subject to oversight by regulatory authorities in those countries.
Once Phase III trials are completed, drug developers submit the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA in the form of an NDA or a biologics license application, or BLA, for approval to commence commercial sales. In most cases, the submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of filing of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. The FDA generally has a six-month review goal of priority NDAs.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 as amended and reauthorized, certain applications or supplements to an application must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The risk evaluation and mitigation strategy could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or additional elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs and BLAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the facility in which it is 
manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with Good Clinical Practice requirements.
After evaluating the NDA or BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
We will also have to complete an approval process similar to that in the U.S. in order to commercialize our product candidates in each foreign country. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional testing. Foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the U.S. The resulting prices may not be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or our corporate collaborators.
In the EU, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any EU member state: a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure, identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies. Regulatory review is led by one member state (the reference-member state), and its assessment—based on safety, quality and efficacy—is reviewed and approved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other member states from which the applicant is seeking approval (the concerned-member states). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products of Human Use, or CHMP, adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the European Commission for final decision on grant of the marketing authorization. While the EC generally follows the CHMP’s opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or if it affects more than 200,000, there is no reasonable expectation that sales of the drug in the U.S. will be sufficient to offset the costs of developing and making the drug available in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If the FDA approves a sponsor’s marketing application for a designated orphan drug for use in the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the sponsor is eligible for a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, during which the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for a drug with the same active moiety and intended for the same use or indication as the approved orphan drug, except in limited circumstances, such as if a subsequent sponsor demonstrates its product is clinically superior. During a sponsor’s orphan drug exclusivity period, competitors, however, may receive approval for drugs with different active moieties for the same indication as the approved orphan drug, or for drugs with the same active moiety as the approved orphan drug, but for different indications. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for a drug with the same active moiety intended for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that grounds for withdrawal of the orphan drug exclusivity exist, or that our product is clinically superior. Further, if a designated orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received orphan drug designation, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Legislation similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries outside of the United States, including the EU. The orphan legislation in the EU is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons, are life‑threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and for which no satisfactory treatment is authorized. The market exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product does not justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess 
new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Additional Regulation for Gene Therapy Products
In addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of standards that apply to gene therapy. FDA has issued various guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which outline factors that FDA will consider at each of the stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical assessment of gene therapies; the chemistry, manufacturing and controls information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects who have been exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high. For instance, FDA usually recommends that sponsors observe all surviving subjects who receive treatment using gene therapies that are based on adeno-associated virus vectors in clinical trials for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a minimum five-year period, followed by 10 years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire. FDA does not require the long-term tracking to be complete prior to its review of the BLA.
In addition to FDA oversight and oversight by institutional review boards, gene therapy clinical trials are also subject to review and oversight by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment.
Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products.
In the U.S., third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our drug products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our products or product candidates, including INGREZZA, may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective.
Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
The marketability of any product or product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.
We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private third-party payor.
There remain legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, the Trump administration signed several executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. Legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, includes a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The 
U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, although it is unclear when a decision will be made. It is also unclear how such litigation will impact the ACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include, among others, aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030, except for a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through May 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken.
Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several Congressional hearings and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. Both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate Finance Committee passed legislation in 2019 to reform pharmaceutical pricing in a variety of meaningful ways, and we expect legislative efforts to reform drug pricing to continue in 2021.
At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the Trump administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Additionally, the Trump administration previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs. On July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to drug pricing that sought to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, effective November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. This rule is undergoing legal challenge.
Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. This rule has been stayed until 2023 while pending litigation is heard in the courts.
On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. Two additional lawsuits in other jurisdictions are challenging the legality of this rule. 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and intense technological change. We face, and will continue to face, competition in the development and marketing of our products and product candidates from academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than we do.
Competition may also arise from, among other things, new drug development technologies, new or improved treatment options for preventing or reducing the incidence of disease in diseases our products treat and new small 
molecule or other classes of therapeutic agents. Such developments by competitors could reduce or eliminate the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates.
Additional information about the competition that our marketed products face is set forth below.
Tardive Dyskinesia. INGREZZA competes with AUSTEDO (deutetrabenazine), which was approved by the FDA for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in adults in August 2017 and is marketed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and several clinical development-stage programs targeting tardive dyskinesia and related movement disorders. Additionally, there are a number of commercially available medicines used to treat tardive dyskinesia off-label, such as Xenazine® (tetrabenazine) and generic equivalents, and various antipsychotic medications (e.g., clozapine), anticholinergics, benzodiazepines (off-label), and botulinum toxin.
Parkinson’s Disease. ONGENTYS competes with two other FDA-approved COMT inhibitors and their generic equivalents. Additionally, there are a number of alternative adjunctive treatment options (FDA-approved and in clinical development) for Parkinson’s patients which compete with ONGENTYS, including various L-dopa preparations, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors and others. In terms of potential future competition, there are several programs in late-stage clinical development.
Endometriosis and Uterine Fibroids. ORILISSA and ORIAHNN each compete with several FDA-approved products for the treatment of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, infertility, and central precocious puberty. Additionally, there is also competition from surgical intervention, including hysterectomies and ablations. Separate from these options, there are many programs in clinical development which serve as potential future competition. Lastly, there are numerous medicines used to treat the symptoms of disease (vs. endometriosis or uterine fibroids directly) which may also serve as competition: oral contraceptives, NSAIDs and other pain medications including opioids.
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia. For CAH, high doses of corticosteroids are the current standard of care to both correct the endogenous cortisol deficiency as well as reduce the excessive ACTH levels. In the U.S. alone, there are more than two dozen companies manufacturing steroid-based products. In addition, there are several clinical development-stage programs targeting CAH and several companies developing medicinal treatments for CAH.
Epilepsy. Our investigational treatments for potential use in epilepsy may in the future compete with numerous approved anti-seizure medications, or ASMs, and development-stage programs being pursued by several other companies. Commonly used ASMs, among others, include phenytoin, levetiracetam, brivaracetam, cenobamate, carbamazepine, clobazam, lamotrigine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, lacosamide, perampanel and cannabidiol. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments specifically indicated for the early infantile epileptic encephalopathies SCN8A-DEE and EE-CSWS; however, a number of different ASMs are currently used in these patient populations. 
Schizophrenia. The investigational treatment NBI-1065844 for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia may in the future compete with off-label antipsychotic and antidepressant medicines, including cariprazine, clozapine, fluoxetine, citalopram, sertraline, and amisulpride. In addition, there are several development-stage programs being pursued by other companies, including pimavanserin, roluperidone, RO6889450 and sodium benzoate. Currently, there are no-FDA approved treatments specifically indicated for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
Other. Our investigational treatments for potential use in endocrinology, neurology, and psychiatry, as well as our investigational gene therapies, may in the future compete with numerous approved products and development-stage programs being pursued by several other companies.
