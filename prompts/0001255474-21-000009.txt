Item 1. Business
Overview
We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in development, production and acquisition activities primarily in the Rocky Mountains region of the United States where we are focused on developing our large resource play in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana. 
On April 1, 2020, we and certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) commenced voluntary cases (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On June 30, 2020, the Debtors filed the Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Whiting Petroleum Corporation and its Debtor affiliates (as amended, modified, and supplemented, the “Plan”). On August 14, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan and on September 1, 2020 (the “Emergence Date”), the Debtors satisfied all conditions required for Plan effectiveness and emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases. Upon emergence, we adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 852 – Reorganizations, which specifies the accounting and financial reporting requirements for entities reorganizing through chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The application of fresh start accounting resulted in a new basis of accounting and us becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result of the implementation of the Plan and the application of fresh start accounting, the consolidated financial statements after the Emergence Date are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements before that date and the historical financial statements on or before the Emergence Date are not a reliable indicator of our financial condition and results of operations for any period after our adoption of fresh start accounting. Refer to the “Fresh Start Accounting” footnote in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. References to “Successor” refer to the Whiting entity and its financial position and results of operations after the Emergence Date. References to “Predecessor” refer to the Whiting entity and its financial position and results of operations on or before the Emergence Date. 
Since our inception, we have built a strong asset base through a combination of property acquisitions, development of proved reserves and exploration activities. Our current operations and capital programs are focused on drilling opportunities and on the development of previously acquired properties, specifically on projects that we believe provide the greatest potential for repeatable success, while selectively pursuing acquisitions that complement our existing core properties. As a result of the sharp decline in commodity prices during 2020 as well as our chapter 11 reorganization, we significantly reduced our level of capital spending during 2020 to more closely align with our reduced cash flows from operating activities. We concentrated our capital program on projects that we expect to generate acceptable rates of return in the current price environment. We continually evaluate our property portfolio and sell properties when we believe that the sales price realized will provide an above average rate of return for the property or when the property no longer matches the profile of properties we desire to own, such as the activity discussed below under “Acquisitions and Divestitures.”
As of December 31, 2020, our estimated proved reserves totaled 260.2 MMBOE and our 2020 average daily production was 98.6 MBOE/d.
The following table summarizes by core area, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2020 with the corresponding pre-tax PV10% values, our fourth quarter 2020 average daily production rates, and our total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of December 31, 2020:

(2) | Pre-tax PV10% may be considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC and is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows (the “Standardized Measure”), which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV10% is computed on the same basis as the Standardized Measure but without deducting future income taxes. We believe pre-tax PV10% is a useful measure for investors when evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. We further believe investors may utilize our pre-tax PV10% as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to other companies because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Our management uses this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and gas properties and acquisitions. However, pre-tax PV10% is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our pre-tax PV10% and Standardized Measure do not purport to present the fair value of our proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves.

During 2020, we incurred $209 million in exploration and development (“E&D”) expenditures, which consisted of $185 million incurred by the Predecessor and $24 million incurred by the Successor, and includes $208 million for the drilling and completion of 54 gross (30.4 net) wells. 
Our current 2021 E&D budget is a range of $228 million to $252 million, which we expect to fund with net cash provided by operating activities and cash on hand. Our level of E&D expenditures is largely discretionary, although a portion of our E&D expenditures are for non-operated properties where we have limited control over the timing and amount of such expenditures, and the amount of funds we devote to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly depending on commodity prices, cash flows, available opportunities and development results, among other factors. To the extent net cash provided by operating activities is higher or lower than currently anticipated, we would generate more or less free cash flow than we currently anticipate, adjust our E&D budget accordingly or adjust borrowings outstanding under our credit facility.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
2020 Acquisitions and Divestitures. In January 2020, we completed the divestiture of our interests in 30 non-operated, producing oil and gas wells and related undeveloped acreage located in McKenzie County, North Dakota for aggregate sales proceeds of $25 million (before closing adjustments). The divested properties consisted of less than 1% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 and 1% of our average daily production for the year ended December 31, 2019.
There were no significant acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
2019 Acquisitions and Divestitures. In July 2019, we completed the divestiture of our interests in 137 non-operated, producing oil and gas wells located in McKenzie, Mountrail and Williams counties of North Dakota for aggregate sales proceeds of $27 million (before closing adjustments). 
In August 2019, we completed the divestiture of our interests in 58 non-operated, producing oil and gas wells located in Richland County, Montana and Mountrail and Williams counties of North Dakota for aggregate sales proceeds of $26 million (before closing adjustments).
On a combined basis, the divested properties consisted of less than 1% of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 and our April 2019 average daily production.
There were no significant acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2019.
2018 Acquisitions and Divestitures. In July 2018, we completed the acquisition of approximately 54,800 net acres in the Williston Basin, including interests in 117 producing oil and gas wells and undeveloped acreage located in Richland County, Montana and McKenzie County, North Dakota for an aggregate purchase price of $130 million (before closing adjustments). The producing properties had estimated proved reserves of 25.7 MMBOE as of the acquisition date, 84% of which were crude oil and NGLs. 
There were no significant divestitures during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Business Strategy
Our goal is to generate meaningful growth in shareholder value through the development, production and acquisition of oil and gas projects with attractive rates of return on invested capital. Specifically, we have focused, and plan to continue to focus, on the following:
Efficiently Developing and Producing our Existing Properties. The development of our large resource play at our Williston Basin project in North Dakota and Montana continues to be our central objective. We have assembled approximately 729,700 gross (478,400 net) developed and undeveloped acres in this area. During 2020, we completed and brought online 46 gross (27.6 net) operated Bakken and Three Forks wells in the Williston Basin. As a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices in 2020, we suspended all drilling and completion activity and terminated our drilling rig contracts in April 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we resumed completion activity, and in February 2021, we brought on a drilling rig. Under our current 2021 capital program, we expect to TIL approximately 56 gross (36.8 net) wells in this area during the year.
At our Redtail field in the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Weld County, Colorado, we have assembled approximately 82,700 gross (71,600 net) developed and undeveloped acres. We completed and TIL 2 gross (1.9 net) wells in our Redtail field during 2020. 
Disciplined Financial Approach. Our goal is to remain financially strong, yet flexible, through the prudent management of our balance sheet and active management of our exposure to commodity price volatility. We have historically funded our acquisition and development activity through a combination of internally generated cash flows, equity and debt issuances, bank borrowings and certain oil and gas property divestitures, as appropriate, to maintain our financial position. As a result of the sharp decline in commodity prices during 2020 as well as our chapter 11 reorganization, we significantly reduced our level of capital spending and implemented various cost reduction measures during 2020 to more closely align our expenditures with our reduced cash flows from operating activities. We have concentrated our capital program on projects that we expect to generate acceptable rates of return in the current price environment. From time to time, we monetize non-core properties and use the net proceeds from these asset sales to repay debt under our credit agreement or fund our E&D expenditures. For example, during 2020 and 2019 we sold certain oil and gas properties operated by third parties that no longer matched the profile of properties we desire to own. In addition, to support cash flow generation on our existing properties and help ensure expected cash flows from newly acquired properties, we periodically enter into derivative contracts. Typically, we use costless collars and swaps to provide an attractive base commodity price level. 
Commitment to Safety and Social Responsibility. We are committed to developing the resources the world needs in a safe and responsible way. We seek ways to better protect habitats and communities, find alternatives to freshwater use, reduce the lifecycle methane emissions of our operations and encourage waste reduction programs. Additionally, we are committed to transparency in reporting our environmental, social and governance performance. See our Sustainability Report published on our website for sustainability performance highlights and additional information.  Information contained in our Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Growing Through Accretive Acquisitions. Since 2010, we have completed 7 separate significant acquisitions of producing properties for total estimated proved reserves of 240.2 MMBOE, as of the effective dates of the acquisitions. Our experienced team of management, land, engineering and geoscience professionals has executed an acquisition program designed to increase reserves and complement our existing properties, including closing purchases and effectively managing the properties we acquire. We intend to selectively pursue the acquisition of properties that are complementary to our core operating areas, as well as explore opportunities in other basins where we can apply our existing knowledge and expertise to build production and add proved reserves.
Competitive Strengths
We believe that our key competitive strengths lie in our focused asset portfolio, our experienced management and technical teams, our commitment to the effective application of new technologies and our commitment to cost management.
Focused, Long-Lived Asset Base. As of December 31, 2020, we had interests in 5,011 gross (2,175 net) productive wells on approximately 856,900 gross (567,000 net) developed acres across our geographical areas. We believe the concentration of our operated assets presents us with multiple opportunities to successfully execute our business strategy by enabling us to leverage our technical expertise and take advantage of operational efficiencies. 
Experienced Management and Technical Teams. Our management team averages 24 years of experience in the oil and gas industry. Our personnel have extensive experience in our core geographical areas, all of our operational disciplines and the evaluation, acquisition and operational assimilation of oil and gas properties.
Commitment to Technology. In each of our core operating areas, we have accumulated extensive engineering, operational, geologic and geophysical technical knowledge. Our technical team has access to an abundance of digital well log, seismic, completion, production and other subsurface information, which is analyzed in order to accurately and efficiently characterize the anticipated performance of 

10




our oil and gas reservoirs. In addition, our information systems enable us to monitor and update our production databases through field automation. This commitment to technology has increased the productivity and efficiency of our field operations and development activities. Administratively, we have leveraged information systems to reduce duplications of data which has increased information reliability and minimized redundant processes.
We continue to advance our completion techniques by utilizing custom, right-sized completion designs based on calibrated models for each of our prospect areas, incorporating multivariate analysis and piloting and adopting the latest completion technologies available. Our multivariate analysis workflow leverages public and proprietary data to solve for production and cost, using those results to optimize well design details for maximum asset value. We plan to continue to use right-sized completion designs on wells we drill in 2021 and to expand our application of data analytics and multivariate analysis to unlock value across the business. Additionally, we plan to continue to reduce time-on-location and total well cost while maximizing our lateral footage through drilling best practices including utilizing top tier drilling rigs, advanced downhole motor and drill bit technology and our custom drilling fluid system.
Commitment to Cost Management. We are committed to cost reduction strategies to become a lower-cost basin operator. As a result of the sharp decline in commodity prices during 2020 as well as our chapter 11 reorganization, we significantly reduced our operating and overhead costs during 2020. In September 2020 and August 2019, we executed workforce reductions as part of our organizational redesign and cost reduction strategies to better align our business with the current operating environment. During 2020, we reduced lease operating expenses across all of our properties and maintained base production with improved artificial lift techniques and targeted workovers. These cost reduction and production maintenance efforts resulted in reducing saltwater disposal costs by 40%, extending well runtimes by 7.5% and reducing down oil volume by 35% from year-end 2019 to year-end 2020. 
We expect that our ongoing cost management efforts will result in sustainable operations and long-term value to our shareholders.

Marketing
We principally sell our oil and gas production to end users, marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline or rail takeaway. In areas where there is no practical access to gathering pipelines, oil is trucked or transported to terminals, market hubs, refineries or storage facilities. We believe that the loss of any individual purchaser would not have a long-term material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations, as alternative customers and markets for the sale of our products are readily available in the areas in which we operate.
Title to Properties
Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens securing indebtedness, liens incident to operating agreements, liens for current taxes and other burdens, including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions. Our credit agreement is also collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of our assets. We do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with the use of our properties or the operation of our business.
We believe that we have satisfactory rights or title to all of our producing properties. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, limited investigation of title is made at the time of acquisition of undeveloped properties. In most cases, we investigate title and obtain title opinions from counsel only when we acquire producing properties or before commencement of drilling operations.
Competition
The oil and gas industry is a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, obtaining investment capital, securing oil field goods and services, marketing oil and natural gas products and attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our resources permit. In addition, the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, completion crews or other equipment and services could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to obtain necessary capital as well as evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment.
In addition, the oil and gas industry as a whole competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. The price and availability of alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar, nuclear and electric power, as well as the emerging impact of climate change activism, fuel conservation measures and governmental requirements for renewable energy sources, could adversely affect our revenue.
Human Capital
We believe that in order to execute our strategy in the highly competitive oil and gas industry we need to attract, develop and retain a highly effective and diverse employee workforce. Our ability to do so ties to a number of factors, including compensation plans, benefits programs, talent development efforts, career opportunity generation and our work environment. As of January 31, 2021, we had approximately 405 full-time employees, 245 of which were field employees and none of which were represented by any labor unions.
Competitive Compensation and Benefits. The objective of our compensation program is to maintain a strong pay-for-performance culture in order to attract, retain and motivate employees. Our program includes competitive market-based salaries, short-term incentives that tie to corporate and individual performance, long-term incentives and market-competitive health and other benefits. 
Training, Development and Career Opportunities.  We are committed to the personal and professional development of our employees, with the belief that a greater level of knowledge, skill and ability is of personal benefit to the employee and fosters a more creative, innovative, efficient and therefore competitive company. We strive to empower our employees to develop the skills they need to perform their current jobs while developing acumen for future opportunities. We want our talent pool to identify a successful and fulfilling career progression within our company. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We recognize the advantages of a company culture that embraces diversity, constructive debate and differing viewpoints. We believe that a workforce diverse in background and experience will create such a culture. We recruit, hire, promote and perform personnel actions without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information or any other applicable status by federal, state or local law. 
Safety. “Safety Always” is one of our core, foundational values. We strive to create a culture of safety that promotes transparency and accountability by providing the tools and resources that empower our people to identify and report potential hazards and stop work when 

12




necessary. During 2020, we improved both our Total Recordable Incident Rate and our Days Away, Restricted and/or Transferred Rate from 2019. Our goal is zero safety incidents and we continuously work toward that goal.
Government Regulation
Regulation of Production
The production of oil and gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and periodic report submittals during operations. All of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and gas wells, the regulation of well spacing and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations that we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production or sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas within its jurisdiction.
Currently, none of our production volumes are produced from offshore leases, however, some of our prior offshore operations were conducted on federal leases that are administered by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (the “BOEM”).  Among other things, BOEM regulations, along with regulations of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”), govern the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal of production facilities from these leases.  We are therefore required to comply with the regulations and orders issued by the BOEM and BSEE under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.  
The Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”) establishes the basis for onshore royalty payments due under federal oil and gas leases through regulations issued under applicable statutory authority. State regulatory authorities establish similar standards for royalty payments due under state oil and gas leases. The basis for royalty payments established by the BLM and the state regulatory authorities is generally applicable to all federal and state oil and gas lessees. Accordingly, we believe that the impact of royalty regulation on our operations should generally be the same as the impact on our competitors.
Regulation of Sale and Transportation of Oil
Our crude oil sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for crude oil transportation rates that allowed for an increase or decrease in the cost of transporting oil to the purchaser. The FERC’s regulations include a methodology for oil pipelines to change their rates through the use of an index system that establishes ceiling levels for such rates. The most recent mandatory five-year review period resulted in a 2020 order from the FERC for the index to be based on Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (the “PPI-FG”) plus 0.78 percent (PPI-FG+0.78%) for the five-year period from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2026. This represents a decrease from the PPI-FG plus 1.23% adjustment from the prior five-year period. The FERC uses a calculation based on a data source that reflects actual cost-of-service data. The regulations provide that each year the Commission will publish the oil pipeline index after the PPI-FG becomes available. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.
Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. In addition, the FERC has emergency authority under the Interstate Commerce Act to intervene and direct priority use of oil pipeline transportation capacity. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.
Transportation and safety of oil and hazardous liquid is subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) under the Pipeline Integrity, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2012. The Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), an agency within the DOT, enforces regulations on all interstate liquids transportation and some intrastate liquids transportation. The effect of regulatory changes under the DOT and their effect on interstate and intrastate oil and hazardous liquid transportation will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.

A portion of our crude oil production may be shipped to market centers using rail transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties. The DOT, generally, and PHMSA, more specifically, establish safety regulations relating to crude-by-rail transportation. In addition, third-party rail operators are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board of the DOT, the Federal Railroad Administration (the “FRA”) of the DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal regulatory agencies. 
In response to rail accidents occurring between 2002 and 2008, the U.S. Congress passed the Rail Safety and Improvement Act of 2008, which implemented regulations governing different areas related to railroad safety. In response to train derailments occurring in the United States and Canada in 2013 and 2014, U.S. regulators have taken a number of additional actions to address the safety risks of transporting crude oil by rail.
In February 2014, the DOT issued an emergency order requiring all persons to ensure crude oil is properly tested and classed prior to offering such product into transportation, and to assure all shipments by rail of crude oil be handled as a Packing Group I or II hazardous material. Also in February 2014, the Association of American Railroads entered into a voluntary agreement with the DOT to implement certain restrictions around the movement of crude oil by rail. In May 2014 (and extended indefinitely in May 2015), the DOT issued an Emergency Restriction/Prohibition Order requiring each railroad carrier operating trains transporting 1,000,000 gallons or more of Bakken crude oil to provide notice to state officials regarding the expected movement of the trains through the counties in each state. The PHMSA and FRA have also issued safety advisories and alerts regarding oil transportation and have issued a report focused on the increased volatility and flammability of Bakken crude oil as compared with other crudes in the U.S. In May 2015, PHMSA issued new rules applicable to “high-hazard flammable trains,” defined as a continuous block of 20 or more tank cars loaded with a flammable liquid or 35 or more tank cars loaded with a flammable liquid dispersed throughout a train. Among other requirements, the new rules require enhanced standards for newly constructed tank cars and retrofitting of existing tank cars, restricted operating speeds, a documented testing and sampling program, and routine assessments that evaluate certain safety and security factors. In December 2015, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (“FAST”) Act became law, further extending PHMSA’s authority to improve the safety of transporting flammable liquids by rail and pursuant to which new regulations phasing out the use of certain older rail cars were finalized in August 2016. In June 2016, the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (“PIPES”) Act became law. The PIPES Act strengthens PHMSA’s safety authority, including an expansion of its ability to issue emergency orders, which was adopted by rule in October 2016 and further enhanced by rule in October 2019. PHMSA continues to review further potential new safety regulations under the PIPES Act and the FAST Act.
We do not currently own or operate rail transportation facilities or rail cars. However, the adoption of any regulations that impact the testing or rail transportation of crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at favorable prices at market centers throughout the U.S., the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The effect of any such regulatory changes will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.
Regulation of Transportation, Storage, Sale and Gathering of Natural Gas
The FERC regulates the transportation and, to a lesser extent, the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and regulations issued under those Acts. In 1989, however, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas, effective January 1, 1993. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at unregulated market prices, in the future Congress could reenact price controls or enact other legislation with detrimental impact on many aspects of our business.
Our natural gas sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms of access to pipeline transportation and underground storage are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. From 1985 to the present, several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales. In addition, the FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry that remain subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies and certain underground storage facilities. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry by making natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. Owners of natural gas pipelines are responsible for administering FERC-approved tariffs which govern the availability, terms and costs of transportation on specific pipelines. Owners of natural gas pipelines may propose changes to these tariffs. Such proposals are subject to comment by interested parties and must be approved by FERC before taking effect. For example, in May 2020 Northern Border Pipeline Company proposed changes to the gas quality standards in its tariff which would have negatively impacted our interests and those of many other pipeline customers. FERC ultimately rejected that proposal in November 2020, but similar proposals could be presented to FERC in the future.
We cannot accurately predict whether the FERC’s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in the markets in which our natural gas is sold. Regulations implemented by the FERC could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain 

14




petroleum product pipelines. In addition, the natural gas industry has historically been heavily regulated. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers.
Transportation and safety of natural gas is subject to regulation by the DOT under the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2012. In addition, intrastate natural gas transportation is subject to enforcement by state regulatory agencies and PHMSA enforces regulations on interstate natural gas transportation. State regulatory agencies can also create their own transportation and safety regulations as long as they meet PHMSA’s minimum requirements. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any of the states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Likewise, the effect of regulatory changes by the DOT and their effect on interstate natural gas transportation will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.
The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. We use the latest tools and technologies to remain compliant with current pipeline safety regulations.
In October 2015, a failure at an underground natural gas storage facility in Southern California prompted PHMSA to issue an advisory bulletin reminding owners and operators of underground storage facilities to review operations, identify the potential for facility leaks and failures and to review and update emergency plans. The State of California proclaimed the underground natural gas storage facility an emergency situation in January 2016. A federal task force was also convened to make recommendations to help avoid such failures. An interim final rule of PHMSA became effective in January 2017 which adopted certain specific industry recommended practices into Part 192 of the Federal Pipeline Safety Regulations. PHMSA later reopened the post-promulgation comment period through November 2017 in response to petitions for reconsideration and has stated it would consider such comments further when it adopts a final rule. Under the interim final rule, if an operator fails to take any measures recommended it would need to justify in its written procedures why the measure is impracticable and unnecessary. PHMSA regulations had previously covered much of the surface piping up to the wellhead at underground natural gas storage facilities served by pipelines and did not extend in part to the “downhole” portion of these facilities. The adopted requirements cover design, construction, material, testing, commissioning, reservoir monitoring and recordkeeping for existing and newly constructed underground natural gas storage facilities as well as procedures and practices for newly constructed and existing underground natural gas storage facilities, such as operations, maintenance, threat identification, monitoring, assessment, site security, emergency response and preparedness, training, recordkeeping and reporting. These regulations and any further increased attention to and requirements for underground storage safety and infrastructure by state and federal regulators that may result from this incident will not affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers.
Environmental Regulations
General. Our oil and gas development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge or release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which often require costly compliance measures that carry substantial penalties for noncompliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling or facility construction commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various materials that can be released into the environment; limit or prohibit project siting, construction or drilling activities on certain lands; require remedial and closure activities to prevent pollution from former operations; and impose substantial liabilities for unauthorized pollution. The EPA and analogous state agencies may delay or refuse the issuance of required permits or otherwise include onerous or limiting permit conditions that may have a significant adverse impact on our ability to conduct operations. 
Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly material handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general. While we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with current applicable environmental laws and regulations, future environmental enforcement remains a material risk due to the potential magnitude of exposure in the event of a noncompliance. We have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, capital costs related to environmental compliance. Such expenditures are included within our overall capital and operating budgets and are not separately itemized.
The environmental laws and regulations which have the most significant impact on the oil and gas exploration and production industry are as follows:
Superfund. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”), and comparable state laws impose strict joint and several liability for sites contaminated by certain hazardous substances 

15




on classes of potentially responsible persons. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where a release occurred and anyone who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In the course of our ordinary operations, we may use, generate or handle material that may be regulated as “hazardous substances.” Consequently, we may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA or comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites where these materials have been disposed or released.
We currently own or lease, and in the past have owned or leased, properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas. Although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on, under or from other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, many of these owned and leased properties have been previously owned or operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons were not under our control and not known to us. Similarly, the disposal facilities where discarded materials are sent are also often operated by third parties whose waste treatment and disposal practices are similarly not under our control. While we only use what we consider to be reputable disposal facilities, we might not know of a potential problem if the problem itself is not discovered until years later. Current and formerly owned or operated properties, adjacent affected properties, offsite disposal facilities and substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required:

● | to investigate the source and extent of impacts from released hazardous substances;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to remove or remediate previously disposed materials, including materials disposed or released by prior owners or operators or other third parties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to clean up and remediate contaminated property, including both soils and contaminated groundwater;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination, including the plugging and abandonment of wells drilled and left inactive by prior owners and operators; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | to pay some or all of the costs of any such action.
--+----------------------------------------------------

At this time, we do not believe that we are a potentially responsible party with respect to any Superfund site and we have not been notified of any claim, liability or damages under CERCLA or any state analog.
Oil Pollution Act. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) and regulations issued under OPA impose strict, joint and several liability on “responsible parties” for removal costs and damages resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility and the lessee, permittee or holder of a right of use and easement of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA establishes a liability limit for onshore facilities of $350 million per spill, while the liability limit for offshore facilities is the payment of all removal costs plus $75 million per spill damages. These limits do not apply if the spill is caused by a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; the spill resulted from a responsible party’s violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation; a responsible party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a cleanup; or a responsible party fails to comply with an order issued under the authority of the Intervention on the High Seas Act. OPA requires the lessee or permittee of the offshore area in which a covered offshore facility is located to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility in the amount of $35 million to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such responsible party is statutorily responsible. The President of the United States may increase the amount of financial responsibility required under OPA by up to $150 million, depending on the risk represented by the quantity or quality of oil that is handled by the facility. Any failure to comply with OPA’s requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill response action may subject a responsible party to administrative penalties. We believe we are in compliance with all applicable OPA financial responsibility obligations. Moreover, we are not aware of any action or event that would subject us to liability under OPA.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements. Additionally, various federal, state and local agencies have jurisdiction over transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous waste in ways not preempted by federal law. We generate solid and hazardous wastes that are subject to RCRA and comparable state laws. Drilling fluid, produced water and many other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil or natural gas are currently exempt from RCRA’s hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be regulated as hazardous waste in the future. In September 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a petition with the EPA, requesting it to reconsider the RCRA hazardous waste exemption for exploration, production and development 

16




wastes. In December 2016, the court entered a Consent Decree resolving the litigation, under which the EPA would issue such a rulemaking or make a determination that it was not necessary by March 15, 2019. In response, in April 2019, the EPA issued a determination that rulemaking to address waste from oil and gas exploration and production operations was not necessary at this time. However, it is possible that the EPA will take up such regulatory changes at a later date. Any such change in the current RCRA exemption and comparable state laws could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes. Additionally, these exploration and production wastes will continue to be regulated by state agencies as solid waste. Also, non-exempt waste streams generated by us will continue to be subject to existing onerous hazardous waste regulations. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes (as they are presently classified) to be significant, any repeal or modification of the oil and gas exploration and production exemption by administrative, legislative or judicial process, or modification of similar exemptions in analogous state statutes would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and would cause us, as well as our competitors, to incur increased operating expenses.
Clean Water Act. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, as amended (“CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into state waters or other waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities.
Where required, costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater and/or the development and implementation of storm water pollution prevention plans. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. 
In addition, the CWA requires permits for discharges of dredged or filled materials into waters of the United States. These permits (“404 Permits”) are under the joint jurisdiction of the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers. 404 Permits may be required where development or construction activities have the potential to impact wetland areas that are considered waters of the United States. In 2020, the EPA revised the definition of waters of the United States to narrow its scope from the 2015 definition that had been promulgated under the Obama administration. In large part, this rulemaking codified that “waters of the United States” include only those waterbodies (including wetlands) that have a “significant nexus” to navigable waters of the United States. The rule is currently being challenged and it is expected that the Biden administration will once again look at rulemaking to address the scope of permitting authority under the CWA. Any expansion of the scope of the CWA could increase costs associated with permitting and regulatory compliance. However, it is expected that any such change would not disparately affect us and our competitors. 
Also, the U.S. Supreme Court in a 2020 case further expanded the reach of the CWA from what had been previously understood. In this case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that a CWA permit may be required when the addition of pollutants into the waters of the United States is the functional equivalent of a direct discharge into those waters. This interpretation could increase costs associated with CWA permitting or subject past activities to liability under the CWA. 
Air Emissions. The Federal Clean Air Act, as amended (the “CAA”), and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants from various industrial sources through air emissions permitting programs and also impose other monitoring and reporting requirements. New Source Performance Standards were promulgated for the oil and gas industry in 2012. These standards set limits for sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compound emissions and required application of reduced emission completion techniques by the industry. We may be required to incur certain capital or operating expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining pre-construction and operating permits and approvals for air emissions. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations.
In May 2016, the EPA issued a final rule regulating methane emissions from oil and natural gas operations (the “Subpart OOOOa Rule”). This rule applies to emissions from new, reconstructed and modified processes and equipment and also requires owners and operators to find and repair leaks to address fugitive emissions. However, in August 2020, the EPA enacted an amendment to the Subpart OOOOa Rule, which removes all methane-specific requirements from production and processing segments and removes VOC and methane emission standards from transmission and storage facilities. 
Certain states have also adopted, or are considering, regulations addressing methane releases from oil and gas operations. Colorado has adopted regulations reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations. Compliance with rules applicable to jurisdictions in which we operate could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may adversely impact our business.

Hydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight rock formations. The process involves the injection of mainly water and sand plus a de minimis amount of chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We expect that we will utilize hydraulic fracturing for the foreseeable future to complete or recomplete wells in areas in which we work. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated at the state level; however, the EPA issued guidance in 2014 to address hydraulic fracturing injections using diesel.
In addition, in June 2016, the EPA issued a final rule promulgating pretreatment standards for discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works. The EPA, along with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the U.S. Department of Interior and the White House Council for Environmental Quality continue to study various aspects of hydraulic fracturing. 
In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress from time to time to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. Multiple states, including Texas, Colorado and Wyoming have already adopted rules requiring disclosures of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and others have enacted regulations imposing additional requirements on activities involving hydraulic fracturing. Chemical disclosure regulations may increase compliance costs and may limit our ability to use cutting-edge technology in markets where disclosure is required. Further, laws such as those restricting the use of or regulating the time, place and manner of hydraulic fracturing (such as setback ordinances) may impact our ability to fully extract reserves. As an example of state governmental actions, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (“COGCC”) has adopted new regulations that will impose, as of January 2021, siting requirements or “setbacks” on certain oil and gas drilling locations based on the distance of a proposed well pad to occupied structures. Pursuant to the regulations, well pads cannot be located within 500 feet of an occupied structure without the consent of the property owner. As part of the permitting process, the COGCC will consider a series of siting requirements for all drilling locations located between 500 feet and 2,000 feet of an occupied structure. Alternatively, the operator may seek a waiver from each owner and tenant within the designated distance. We are currently evaluating the impact of these regulations on our business. At this time, we do not anticipate near-term changes to our development program in the DJ Basin based on these regulations. We may, however, experience increased costs to comply with such requirements or delays or curtailment in permitting, impacting our development or production activities. Such delays, curtailments, limitations, or prohibitions, if determined to be significant, could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows and results of operations and may negatively impact our reportable quantities of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves. No assurance can be given as to whether or not such measures might be adopted in additional jurisdictions in which our properties are located. If new laws, regulations or ordinances that significantly restrict or otherwise impact hydraulic fracturing are passed by Congress or adopted in the states or local municipalities where our properties are located, such legal requirements could prohibit or make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities.
Further, in May 2014, the EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to the disclosure of chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production. On July 11, 2014, the EPA extended the public comment period for the rulemaking to September 18, 2014. The EPA has not yet taken further action with respect to this rule. Depending on the precise disclosure requirements the EPA elects to impose, if any, we may be obliged to disclose valuable proprietary information, and failure to do so may subject us to penalties. In addition, we may be required to disclose information of third parties, that may be inaccurate or that we may be contractually prohibited from disclosing, which could also subject us to penalties.
In addition, in July 2014, a major university and U.S. Geological Survey researchers published a study purporting to find a connection between the deep well injection of hydraulic fracturing wastewater and a sharp increase in seismic activity in Oklahoma since 2008. This study, as well as subsequent studies and reports, may trigger new legislation or regulations that would limit or ban the disposal of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in deep injection wells. If such new laws or rules are adopted, our operations may be curtailed while alternative treatment and disposal methods are developed and approved.
Global Warming and Climate Change. In December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHG”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climate changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented regulations that restrict emissions of GHG under existing provisions of the CAA.
At present, the EPA may establish GHG permitting requirements for stationary sources already subject to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V requirements of the CAA. Certain of our equipment and installations may currently be subject to PSD and Title V requirements and hence, under the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling, may also be subject to the installation of controls to capture GHGs. For any equipment or installation so subject, we may have to incur increased compliance costs to capture related GHG emissions.
In October 2016, the EPA proposed revisions to the rule applicable to GHGs for PSD and Title V permitting requirements. The public comment period for the rulemaking concluded on December 16, 2016. While no final rule has been published, this may be taken up as a priority by the Biden administration.

In August 2015, the EPA issued a rule to reduce carbon emissions from electric generating units. The rule, commonly called the “Clean Power Plan,” required states to develop plans to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel-fired generating units commencing in 2022, with the reductions to be fully phased in by 2030. However, in February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan while it was being challenged in court. On October 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule that would repeal the Clean Power Plan and on August 18, 2018, the EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule as a replacement to the Clean Power Plan. The EPA issued the final ACE rule in June 2019. As expected, over 20 states and public health and environmental organizations challenged the rule and it was vacated on January 29, 2021. The matter has been remanded to the EPA and it is expected that the Biden administration will propose new rules in this area during the next four years.
In addition, both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHG, and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHG, primarily through the development of GHG inventories, GHG permitting and/or regional GHG “cap and trade” programs. Most of these “cap and trade” programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Also, in recent years, lawsuits have been brought against other energy companies for matters relating to climate change. Multiple states and localities have also initiated investigations in climate-change related matters. While the current suits focus on a variety of issues, at their core they seek compensation for the effects of climate change from companies with ties to GHG emissions. It is currently unknown what the outcome of these types of actions may be, but the costs of defending against such actions may be expected to rise. Finally, it should be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our assets and operations.
Consideration of Environmental Issues in Connection with Governmental Approvals. Our operations frequently require licenses, permits and/or other governmental approvals. Several federal statutes, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”), the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) and the Coastal Zone Management Act (“CZMA”), require federal agencies to evaluate environmental issues in connection with granting such approvals and/or taking other major agency actions. OCSLA, for instance, requires the U.S. Department of Interior to evaluate whether certain proposed activities would cause serious harm or damage to the marine, coastal or human environment. Similarly, NEPA requires the U.S. Department of Interior and other federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency would have to prepare an environmental assessment and potentially an environmental impact statement. Recent federal court cases involving natural gas pipelines have involved challenges to the sufficiency of the evaluation of climate change impacts in environmental impact statements prepared under NEPA. The CZMA, on the other hand, aids states in developing a coastal management program to protect the coastal environment from growing demands associated with various uses, including offshore oil and gas development. In obtaining various approvals from the U.S. Department of Interior, we must certify that we will conduct our activities in a manner consistent with all applicable regulations.
