ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

 NorthWestern Energy - Delivering a Bright Future
NorthWestern Corporation, doing business as NorthWestern Energy, provides essential energy infrastructure and valuable services that enrich lives and empower communities while serving as long-term partners to our customers and communities. We are working to deliver safe, reliable, and innovative energy solutions that create value for customers, communities, employees, and investors. This includes bridging our history as a regulated utility safely providing low-cost and reliable service with our future as a globally-aware company offering a broader array of services performed by highly-adaptable and skilled employees. We provide electricity and / or natural gas to approximately 743,000 customers in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Yellowstone National Park. We have provided service in South Dakota and Nebraska since 1923 and in Montana since 2002.
We manage our businesses by the nature of services provided, and operate principally in three business segments: electric utility operations; natural gas utility operations; and all other, which primarily consists of unallocated corporate costs. Our electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, transmission and distribution of electricity, and our natural gas utility operations include the production, purchase, transmission, storage, and distribution of natural gas. Our customer base consists of a mix of residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers. 
Our electric utility operations include the generation, purchase, transmission, and distribution of electricity. Our natural gas utility operations include the production, purchase, transmission, storage, and distribution of natural gas. Our electric and natural gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of our largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our utility operations are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on operating performance. Consumption of electricity is often greater in the summer and winter months for cooling and heating, respectively. Because natural gas is used primarily for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon weather patterns throughout our service territory, and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season. 
Environmental, Social and Governance
We are focused on meeting current energy infrastructure and service needs at a reasonable and fair cost for today’s customers while ensuring the ability to meet the needs of tomorrow’s customers. “Sustainability” requires meeting economic, societal, and environmental objectives. As a provider of essential infrastructure and service, a sustainable enterprise is vital to our customers and communities, as well as to our investors and employees. For a full description of our environmental, social, governance and sustainability activities, please see our reports at http://www.northwesternenergy.com.
We strive to balance legal requirements to provide cost-effective, reliable and stably priced energy with being good stewards of natural resources and a diligent focus on sustainability. We own a mix of clean and carbon-free energy resources balanced with traditional energy sources that are necessary for us to deliver affordable and reliable electricity to our customers 24/7. In 2020, approximately 65 percent of our retail needs originated from carbon-free resources, more than two times better than the total U.S. electric power industry (29 percent carbon-free). 
Montana - Commitment to Reduction in Carbon Intensity
Nearly 70% of the energy we supply in Montana comes from carbon-free sources, including hydro, wind and solar. In December 2019, we announced a commitment to reduce the carbon intensity of our electric energy portfolio for Montana by 90 percent by 2045 as compared with our 2010 carbon intensity as a baseline. Over the last decade, we have already reduced the carbon intensity of our Montana generation portfolio by more than 50 percent.

MONTANA ELECTRIC OPERATIONS

Our regulated electric utility business in Montana includes generation, transmission and distribution. Our service territory covers approximately 107,600 square miles, representing approximately 73 percent of Montana's land area. During 2020, we delivered electricity to approximately 384,700 customers in 208 communities and their surrounding rural areas, 11 rural electric cooperatives and, in Wyoming, to the Yellowstone National Park. In 2020, by category, residential, commercial, industrial, and other sales accounted for approximately 44%, 47%, 5%, and 4%, respectively, of our Montana retail electric utility revenue. 
Transmission and Distribution
Our electric system is composed of high voltage transmission lines and low voltage distribution lines as follows:

Electric Transmission Lines | 
Miles of 500 kV | 497 
Miles of 230 kV | 956 
Miles of 161 kV | 1,192 
Miles of 115 kV and lower voltage | 4,164 
Total Miles of Electric Transmission Lines | 6,809 
Electric Distribution Lines | 
Miles of overhead line | 13,071
Miles of underground line | 4,997 
Total Miles of Electric Distribution Lines | 18,068
Total Transmission and Distribution Substations | 398 

In addition to delivering energy to distribution systems to serve customers, we also transmit electricity for nonregulated entities owning generation, and utilities, cooperatives, and power marketers serving the Montana electricity market. Our total control area peak demand was approximately 1,799 MWs on January 14, 2020. Our control area average demand for 2020 was approximately 1,305 MWs per hour, with total energy delivered of more than 12.0 million MWHs. 
Our transmission system is directly interconnected with Avista Corporation; Idaho Power Company; PacifiCorp; the Bonneville Power Administration; WAPA; and Montana Alberta Tie Ltd. Such interconnections, coupled with transmission line capacity made available under agreements with some of the above entities, permit the interchange, purchase, and sale of power among all major electric systems in the west interconnecting with the winter-peaking northern and summer-peaking southern regions of the western power system. We provide wholesale transmission service and firm and non-firm transmission services for eligible transmission customers. Our 500 kV transmission system, which is jointly owned, along with our 230 kV and 161 kV facilities, form the key assets of our Montana transmission system. Lower voltage systems provide transmission for local area service needs.
Electric Supply
Our annual retail electric supply load requirements average approximately 750 MWs, with a peak load of approximately 1,200 MWs, and are supplied by owned and contracted resources and market purchases with multiple counterparties. 
Owned generation resources supplied approximately 60 percent of our retail load requirements for 2020. We expect that approximately 65 percent of our retail obligations will be met by owned generation resources in 2021. In addition, QFs provide a total of 388 MWs of contracted resources, including 87 MWs from waste petroleum coke and waste coal, 268 MWs from wind, 16 MWs from hydro, and 17 MWs from solar projects. We have several other long and medium-term power purchase 
agreements including contracts for 135 MWs of wind generation, 52 MWs of natural gas generation, and 21 MWs of seasonal base-load hydro supply. For 2021, including both owned and contracted resources, we have resources to provide over 90 percent of the energy necessary to meet our forecasted retail load requirements.
The following chart depicts the makeup of our current owned and long-term contracted resources within our Montana Electric generation portfolio. Hydro generation is by far our largest and most important resource, as it is reliable, dramatically lowers the portfolio's carbon intensity, and reduces economic risks associated with future carbon costs.
Owned Generation Facilities

Details of these generating facilities are described in the following tables.

Colstrip Unit 4 provides base-load supply and is operated by Talen Montana, LLC (Talen). Talen has a 30 percent ownership interest in Colstrip Unit 3. We have a reciprocal sharing agreement with Talen regarding the operation of Colstrip Units 3 and 4, in which each party receives 15 percent of the respective combined output and is responsible for 15 percent of the respective operating and construction costs, regardless of whether a particular cost is specified to Colstrip Unit 3 or 4. However, each party is responsible for its own fuel-related costs. Colstrip Unit 4 is supplied with fuel from adjacent coal reserves under a coal supply agreement in effect through 2025. See Item 1A Risk Factors "Regulatory, Legislative and Legal Risks" for further discussion regarding the service life of generation facilities. 
Resource Planning and Portfolio Standards
Resource planning is an important function necessary to meet our customers' future energy needs and is used to guide resource acquisition activities. We filed our latest resource plan with the MPSC in August 2019 and supplemented that plan in December 2020. We have significant projected generation capacity deficits and negative reserve margins. In Montana, approximately 46 percent of our peak electric requirements are served by market purchases, exposing our customers to greater market exposure (price and availability) than our regional peers. Based on current estimates, we forecast that our portfolio will be 725 MW short by 2025 (including reserve margins), considering expiring contracts and a modest increase in customer demand. 
We issued an all-source competitive solicitation request in February 2020 for up to 280 MWs of peaking and flexible capacity to be available for commercial operation in early 2023. In addition to our responsibility to meet peak demand, national reliability standards effective July 2016 increased the need for us to have greater dispatchable generation capacity available and be capable of increasing or decreasing output to address the irregular nature of intermittent generation such as wind or solar. Our generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy and capacity resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet our obligation to serve retail customers while maintaining reliability.
Renewable portfolio standards (RPS) enacted in Montana currently require that 15 percent of our annual electric supply portfolio be derived from eligible sources, including resources such as wind, biomass, solar, and small hydroelectric. Eligible 
resources used to serve our load generate RECs. Any RECs in excess of the annual requirements for a given year are carried forward for up to two years to meet future RPS needs. While our hydro generation assets are not eligible resources under the RPS, any qualifying additions would be eligible. Given contracts under negotiation and our portfolio resources, we expect to meet the Montana RPS requirements through the 2040s. The penalty for not meeting the RPS is up to $10 per MWH for each REC short of the requirement.
Western Energy Imbalance Market
We expect to enter the Western Energy Imbalance Market (EIM), operated by the California Independent System Operator (California ISO), in the second quarter of 2021. We studied the value and costs of the EIM for several years prior to the decision to participate in the Western EIM. Utilities in the western United States outside the California ISO have traditionally relied upon a combination of automated and manual dispatch within the hour to balance generation and load to maintain reliable supply. These utilities have limited capability to transact within the hour outside their balancing area. In contrast, energy imbalance markets use automated intra-hour economic dispatch of generation from committed resources to serve loads. The Western EIM is intended to reduce power supply costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, to integrate intermittent power more effectively, and to enhance reliability. Participation in the Western EIM is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the western United States. 

SOUTH DAKOTA ELECTRIC OPERATIONS

Our South Dakota electric utility business operates as a vertically integrated generation, transmission and distribution utility. We have the exclusive right to serve an area in South Dakota comprised of 25 counties. We provide retail electricity to more than 63,900 customers in 110 communities in South Dakota. In 2020, by category, residential, commercial and other sales accounted for approximately 39%, 59%, and 2%, respectively, of our South Dakota retail electric utility revenue.
Transmission and Distribution
Our electric system includes high voltage transmission and low voltage distribution lines as follows: 

Electric Transmission Lines | 
Miles of 345 kV | 25 
Miles of 230 kV | 18 
Miles of 115 kV and lower voltages | 1,265
Total Miles of Electric Transmission Lines | 1,308
Electric Distribution Lines | 
Miles of overhead line | 1,631
Miles of underground line | 683 
Total Miles of Electric Distribution Lines | 2,314
Total Transmission and Distribution Substations | 119 


Our South Dakota system is interconnected with the transmission facilities of Otter Tail Power Company; Montana-Dakota Utilities Co.; Xcel Energy Inc.; and WAPA. We have emergency interconnections with the transmission facilities of East River Electric Cooperative, Inc. and West Central Electric Cooperative. 
We are a transmission-owning member in the SPP. Each year, we review all new or modified transmission assets and transfer functional control of assets that qualify under the SPP Tariff to the SPP. This annual update goes into effect on April 1st each year. To date, we have transferred control of 333 line miles of 115 kV facilities and over 158 line miles of 69 kV facilities. The Coyote, Big Stone, and Neal power plants, which we jointly own, are connected directly to the MISO system. Our ownership rights in the transmission lines from these plants to our distribution system allow us to move the power to our customers. Along with operating the transmission system, SPP also coordinates regional transmission planning for all of its members.

Electric Supply
Our annual retail electric supply load requirements average approximately 200 MWs, with a peak load of 328 MWs, and are supplied by owned and contracted resources and market purchases. We use market purchases and peaking generation to provide peak supply in excess of our base-load capacity. We are a member of the SPP. As a market participant in SPP, we buy and sell wholesale energy and reserves in both day-ahead and real-time markets through the operation of a single, consolidated SPP balancing authority. We and other SPP members submit into the SPP market both offers to sell our generation and bids to purchase power to serve our load. SPP optimizes next-day and real-time generation dispatch across the region and provides participants with greater access to economic energy. Marketing activities in SPP are handled for us by a third-party provider acting as our agent. 
Our electric supply resources include 210 MWs from jointly owned coal plants and an 80 MW natural gas plant. Additional resources include several natural gas peaking units and an 80 MW wind facility. We also purchase the output of four wind projects, three of which are QFs, under power purchase agreements. Actual output for our wind resources varies based upon weather conditions. 
Owned Generation Facilities

Details of our generating facilities are described further in the following chart:

Generation Facilities | Fuel Source | OwnershipInterest | OwnedMW
Big Stone Plant, located near Big Stone City in northeastern South Dakota | Sub-bituminous coal | 23.4% | 111 
Coyote I Electric Generating Station, located near Beulah, North Dakota | Lignite coal | 10.0% | 43 
Neal Electric Generating Unit No. 4, located near Sioux City, Iowa | Sub-bituminous coal | 8.7% | 56 
Aberdeen Generating Units No. 1 and 2, located near Aberdeen, South Dakota | Natural gas & Liquid Fuel | 100.0% | 80 
Beethoven Wind Project, located near Tripp, South Dakota | Wind | 100.0% | 80 
Miscellaneous combustion turbine units and small diesel units (used only during peak periods) | Combination of fuel oil and natural gas | 100.0% | 41 
Total | | | 411 

The Big Stone, Coyote and Neal plants are owned jointly with unaffiliated parties. Each of the jointly owned plants is subject to a joint management structure, and we are not the operator of any of these plants. Based on our ownership interest, we are entitled to a proportionate share of the capacity of our jointly owned plants and are responsible for a proportionate share of the operating costs. 
The fuel for our jointly owned base-load generating plants is provided through supply contracts of various lengths with several coal companies. Coyote is a mine-mouth generating facility. Neal #4 and Big Stone receive their fuel supply via rail. The average delivered cost by type of fuel burned varies between generation facilities due to differences in transportation costs and owner purchasing power for coal supply. Changes in our fuel costs are passed on to customers through the operation of the fuel adjustment clause in our South Dakota tariffs.
Resource Planning
We have a resource plan that includes estimates of customer usage and programs to provide for the economic, reliable and timely supply of energy. We continue to update our load forecast to identify the future electric energy needs of our customers, and we evaluate additional generating capacity requirements on an ongoing basis. 
We submitted a plan to the SDPUC in 2018 to provide for the modernization of our generating fleet, which is focused on improving reliability and flexibility. Based on the results of associated competitive solicitation processes, we are currently constructing 60 MW of flexible reciprocating internal combustion engines at a brownfield site near Huron, South Dakota expected to be in service by late 2021, with construction costs of approximately $80 million, and a new 30-40 MW flexible generation facility in Aberdeen, South Dakota planned to be in service in early 2024, with a cost of approximately $60 million. 

NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS

Montana
Our regulated natural gas utility business in Montana includes production, storage, transmission and distribution. During 2020, we distributed natural gas to approximately 203,700 customers in 118 Montana communities over a system that consists of approximately 4,900 miles of underground distribution pipelines. We also serve several smaller distribution companies that provide service to approximately 37,000 customers. We transmit natural gas in Montana from production receipt points and storage facilities to distribution points and other nonaffiliated transmission systems. We transported natural gas volumes of approximately 42 Bcf during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Miles of Natural Gas Transmission | 2,165
Miles of Natural Gas Distribution | 4,892
City Gate Stations | 150 

 We have connections in Montana with four major, unaffiliated transmission systems: Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline, NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd., Colorado Interstate Gas, and Spur Energy. Twelve compressor sites provide more than 38,000 horsepower on the transmission line and an additional 15,000 horsepower at our storage fields, capable of moving more than 336,000 dekatherms per day. In addition, we own and operate two transmission pipelines through our subsidiaries, Canadian-Montana Pipe Line Corporation and Havre Pipeline Company, LLC.
Natural gas is used primarily for residential and commercial heating, and as fuel for two electric generating facilities. The demand for natural gas largely depends upon weather conditions. Our Montana retail natural gas supply requirements for the year ended December 31, 2020, were approximately 21.0 Bcf. Our Montana natural gas supply requirements for electric generation fuel for the year ended December 31, 2020, were approximately 2.8 Bcf. We have contracted with several major producers and marketers with varying contract durations to provide the anticipated supply to meet ongoing requirements. Our natural gas supply requirements are fulfilled through third-party fixed-term purchase contracts, short-term market purchases and owned production. Our portfolio approach to natural gas supply is intended to enable us to maintain a diversified supply of natural gas sufficient to meet our supply requirements. We benefit from direct access to suppliers in significant natural gas producing regions in the United States, primarily the Rocky Mountains (Colorado), Montana, and Alberta, Canada.
Owned Production and Storage - Since 2010, we have acquired gas production and gathering system assets as a part of an overall strategy to provide rate stability and customer value: as we own these assets, which are regulated, our customers are protected from potential price spikes in the market. As of December 31, 2020, these owned reserves totaled approximately 43.1 Bcf and are estimated to provide approximately 3.5 Bcf in 2021, or about 16 percent of our expected annual retail natural gas load in Montana. In addition, we own and operate three working natural gas storage fields in Montana with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 17.85 Bcf and maximum aggregate daily deliverability of approximately 203,400 dekatherms. 
South Dakota and Nebraska
We provide natural gas to approximately 48,000 customers in 62 South Dakota communities and approximately 42,700 customers in three Nebraska communities. In South Dakota, we also transport natural gas for nine gas-marketing firms and three large end-user accounts. In Nebraska, we transport natural gas for four gas-marketing firms and one end-user account. We delivered approximately 27.5 Bcf of third-party transportation volume on our South Dakota distribution system and approximately 3.7 Bcf of third-party transportation volume on our Nebraska distribution system during 2020.

Miles of Natural Gas Transmission | 55 
Miles of Natural Gas Distribution | 2,524

Our South Dakota natural gas supply requirements for the year ended December 31, 2020, were approximately 6.0 Bcf. We contract with a third party under an asset management agreement to manage transportation and storage of supply to minimize cost and price volatility to our customers. In Nebraska, our natural gas supply requirements for the year ended December 31, 2020, were approximately 4.3 Bcf. We contract with a third party under an asset management agreement that includes pipeline capacity, supply, and asset optimization activities. To supplement firm gas supplies in South Dakota and Nebraska, we contract for firm natural gas storage services to meet the heating season and peak day requirements of our customers. 
Municipal Natural Gas Franchise Agreements - We have municipal franchises to provide natural gas service in the communities we serve. The terms of the franchises vary by community. Our Montana franchises typically have a fixed 10-year term and continue for additional 10-year terms unless and until canceled, with 5 years notice. The maximum term permitted under Nebraska law for these franchises is 25 years while the maximum term permitted under South Dakota law is 20 years. Our policy generally is to seek renewal or extension of a franchise in the last year of its term. We continue to serve those customers while we obtain formal renewals. During the next five years, fifteen of our Montana franchises are scheduled to reach the end of their fixed term, which account for approximately 83,000 or 41 percent of our Montana natural gas customers. Five of our South Dakota franchises and one franchise in Nebraska, which account for approximately 30,500 or 34 percent of our South Dakota and Nebraska natural gas customers, are scheduled to reach the end of their fixed term during the next five years. We do not anticipate termination of any of these franchises.
 
REGULATION

Base rates are the rates that are intended to allow us the opportunity to collect from our customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to our cost of providing delivery and rate-based supply services, plus a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. We have both electric and natural gas base rates and cost tracking clauses. We may ask the respective regulatory commission to increase base rates from time to time. Rate increases are normally granted based on historical data and those increases may not always keep pace with increasing costs. For more information on current regulatory matters, see Note 3 - Regulatory Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following is a summary of our rate base (amounts we earn a return on) and authorized rates of return in each jurisdiction, estimated as of December 31, 2020: 

Jurisdiction and Service | Implementation Date | Authorized Rate Base (millions) | Estimated Rate Base (millions) | Authorized Overall Rate of Return | Authorized Return on Equity | Authorized Equity Level
Montana electric delivery and production (1) | April 2019 | $2,030.1 | $2,500.9 | 6.92% | 9.65% | 49.38%

 _____________________
(1)    The revenue requirement associated with the FERC regulated portion of Montana electric transmission and ancillary services are included as revenue credits to our MPSC jurisdictional customers. Therefore, we do not separately reflect FERC authorized rate base or authorized returns.
(2)    The Montana gas revenue requirement includes a step down which approximates annual depletion of our natural gas production assets included in rate base.
(3)    For those items marked as "n/a," the respective settlement and/or order was not specific as to these terms.
MPSC Regulation
Our Montana operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the MPSC with respect to rates, terms and conditions of service, accounting records, electric service territorial issues and other aspects of our operations, including when we issue, assume, or guarantee securities in Montana, or when we create liens on our regulated Montana properties. We have an obligation to provide service to our customers with an opportunity to earn a regulated rate of return. 
Electric Supply Tracking Mechanism - The Power Cost and Credit Adjustment Mechanism (PCCAM) incorporates sharing of a portion of the business risk or benefit associated with the cost of power purchased and fuel used to generate electricity. Customer prices may be adjusted annually to absorb a portion of the difference between base revenues and actual costs for the annual tracking period. Annual filings are based on a July through June 12-month tracking period, and are subject to review by the MPSC to determine if electric supply procurement activities were prudent. If the MPSC subsequently determines that a procurement activity was imprudent, recovery of such costs may be disallowed. 
Natural Gas Supply Tracker - Rates for our Montana natural gas supply are set by the MPSC. Certain supply rates are adjusted on a monthly basis for volumes and costs during each July to June 12-month tracking period. Annually, supply rates are adjusted to include any differences between the previous tracking year's revenues and expenses for recovery during the subsequent tracking year. We submit annual natural gas tracker filings for the actual 12-month period ended June 30 and for the projected supply costs for the next 12-month period. The MPSC reviews such filings and makes its cost recovery determination based on whether or not our natural gas energy supply procurement activities were prudent. If the MPSC subsequently determines that a procurement activity was imprudent, recovery of such costs may be disallowed. 
Montana Property Tax Tracker - We file an annual property tax tracker (including other state/local taxes and fees) with the MPSC for an automatic rate adjustment, which reflects the incremental property taxes since our last base rate filing adjusted for the associated income tax benefit.
Fixed Cost Recovery Mechanism Pilot - In our 2018 Montana electric rate settlement, the MPSC approved a Fixed Cost Recovery Mechanism Pilot (FCRM), intended to decouple our recovery of fixed, test-year based transmission, distribution, and production costs from sales of energy. At our request, the MPSC delayed implementation of the pilot to July 1, 2021. The FCRM is expected to function over a four-year pilot period, applying primarily to residential customers.

SDPUC Regulation
Our South Dakota operations are subject to SDPUC jurisdiction with respect to rates, terms and conditions of service, accounting records, electric service territorial issues and other aspects of our electric and natural gas operations. Our retail electric rates, approved by the SDPUC, provide several options for residential, commercial and industrial customers, including dual-fuel, interruptible, special all-electric heating, and other special rates. Our retail natural gas tariffs include gas transportation rates for transportation through our distribution systems by customers and natural gas marketers from the interstate pipelines at which our systems take delivery to the end-user. Such transporting customers nominate the amount of natural gas to be delivered daily. On a daily basis, we monitor usage for these customers and balance it against their respective supply agreements. 
An electric adjustment clause provides for quarterly adjustment based on differences in the delivered cost of energy, delivered cost of fuel, ad valorem taxes paid and commission-approved fuel incentives. The adjustment goes into effect upon filing, and is deemed approved within 10 days after the information filing unless the SDPUC staff requests changes during that period. A purchased gas adjustment provision in our natural gas rate schedules permits the monthly adjustment of charges to customers to reflect increases or decreases in purchased gas, gas transportation and ad valorem taxes. 
NPSC Regulation

Our Nebraska natural gas rates and terms and conditions of service for residential and smaller commercial customers are regulated by the NPSC. High volume customers are not subject to such regulation, but can file complaints if they allege discriminatory treatment. Under the Nebraska State Natural Gas Regulation Act, a regulated natural gas utility may propose a change in rates to its regulated customers, if it files an application for a rate increase with the NPSC and with the communities in which it serves customers. The utility may negotiate with those communities for a settlement with regard to the proposed rate change if the affected communities representing more than 50 percent of the affected ratepayers agree to direct negotiations, or it may proceed to have the NPSC review the filing and make a determination. Our tariffs have been approved by the NPSC, and the NPSC has adopted certain rules governing the terms and conditions of service of regulated natural gas utilities. Our retail natural gas tariffs provide residential, general service and commercial and industrial options, as well as firm and interruptible transportation service. A purchased gas adjustment clause provides for adjustments based on changes in gas supply and interstate pipeline transportation costs.

FERC Regulation

We are subject to FERC's jurisdiction and regulations with respect to rates for electric transmission service and electricity sold at wholesale, hydro licensing and operations, the issuance of certain securities, incurrence of certain long-term debt, and compliance with mandatory reliability standards, among other things. Under FERC's open access transmission policy promulgated in Order No. 888, as owners of transmission facilities, we are required to provide open access to our transmission facilities under filed tariffs at cost-based rates. In addition, we are required to comply with FERC's Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers. 
Our Montana wholesale transmission customers, such as cooperatives, industrial customers, and other customers that have third-party commodity supply providers, are served under our OATT, which is on file with FERC. The OATT defines the terms, conditions, and rates of our Montana transmission service, including ancillary services. Our South Dakota transmission operations are in the SPP, and transmission service is provided under the SPP OATT. 
Our natural gas transportation pipelines are generally not subject to FERC's jurisdiction, although we are subject to state regulation. We conduct limited interstate transportation in Montana and South Dakota that is subject to FERC jurisdiction, and 
FERC has allowed the MPSC and SDPUC to set the rates for this interstate service. We have capacity agreements in South Dakota and Nebraska with interstate pipelines that are also subject to FERC jurisdiction.
Our hydroelectric generating facilities are licensed by the FERC and operated under the terms of those licenses and FERC regulations. In connection with the relicensing of these generating facilities, applicable law permits the FERC to issue a new license to the existing licensee, to a new licensee, or alternatively allows the U.S. government to take over the facility. If the existing licensee is not relicensed, it is compensated for its net investment in the facility, not to exceed the fair value of the property taken, plus reasonable severance damages to other property affected by the lack of relicensing. 
Reliability Standards - We must comply with the standards and requirements that apply to the NERC functions for which we have registered in both the MRO for our South Dakota operations and the WECC for our Montana operations. WECC and the MRO have responsibility for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the FERC-approved mandatory reliability standards within their respective regions. We expect that the reliability standards will continue to evolve and change as a result of modifications, guidance, and clarification following industry implementation and ongoing audits and enforcement. 

COMPETITION

We are subject to public policies that promote competition and development of energy markets. Our industrial and large commercial customers have the ability to choose their electric supplier and may generate their own electricity. In addition, customers may have the option of substituting other fuels or relocating their facilities to a lower cost region. Customers have the opportunity to supply their own power with distributed generation including solar generation, and in Montana, can currently avoid paying for most of the fixed production, transmission and distribution costs incurred to serve them. These incentives and federal tax subsidies make distributed generating resources viable potential competitors to our electric service business. 
In addition, the FERC has continued to promote competitive wholesale markets through open access transmission and other means. Our wholesale customers can purchase their output from generation resources of competing suppliers or non-contracted quantities and use the transmission systems to serve their load. There is also competition for available transmission capacity to meet our electric supply needs to serve customers.


ENVIRONMENTAL

The operation of electric generating, transmission and distribution facilities, and gas gathering, storage, transportation and distribution facilities, along with the development (involving site selection, environmental assessments, and permitting) and construction of these assets, are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental and land use laws and regulations. Our activities involve compliance with diverse laws and regulations that address emissions and impacts to the environment, including air and water, and protection of natural resources and wildlife. We monitor federal, state, and local environmental initiatives to determine potential impacts on our financial results. As new laws or regulations are issued, we assess their applicability and implement the necessary modifications to our facilities or their operation to maintain ongoing compliance.
To this end, the new Biden Administration has set ambitious goals to address climate change, including the goal of a carbon free power sector by 2035 and net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Executive Orders issued by the Administration in its first few weeks include initiatives and directives intended to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, address climate change issues and decarbonize the energy sector. In particular, these Executive Orders, among other things, establish climate considerations as key components of United States foreign policy and national security, establish a White House Office of Domestic Climate policy as well as a National Climate Task Force, call for agency heads to identify any fossil fuel subsidies provided by their agencies and to take steps to ensure that federal funding is not directly subsidizing fossil fuels, and direct agencies to immediately review all regulations proposed or finalized by the Trump Administration that conflict with the Biden Administration’s objectives and to take action to rescind or revise those rules. President Biden also announced the United States’ intent to rejoin the Paris Agreement.
Implementation of these initiatives and directives has the potential to limit or curtail our operations, including the burning of fossil fuels at our coal-fired power plants. While we strive to comply with all environmental regulations applicable to our operations, it is not possible to determine when or to what extent additional facilities or modifications of existing or planned facilities will be required as a result of changes to energy and environmental laws and regulations, or new administrative or judicial interpretations or enforcement decisions regarding them.

HUMAN CAPITAL

Our ability to achieve the objectives of our business strategy and serve our customers within our service territory depends on employing skilled professionals. We aspire to be an employer of choice by offering competitive salaries and benefits, providing a safe working environment, valuing diversity, fostering inclusion and encouraging a healthful work–life balance. Our success comes when employees feel empowered to take initiative, voice their opinions, and build on their experiences within our company and our communities.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,530 employees. Of these, 1,225 employees were in Montana and 305 were in South Dakota or Nebraska. Of our Montana employees, 470, or 38 percent, were covered by seven collective bargaining agreements involving five unions. Due to COVID-19, the Company negotiated a one-year contract extension with a wage proposal for each of the seven Montana agreements. Six of the contract extensions will expire in 2021 with one extending to 2022. Of our South Dakota and Nebraska employees, 172, or 56 percent, are covered by a collective bargaining agreement renegotiated in 2019 that expires at the end of 2021. We consider our relations with employees to be good. 
Talent Management
Attraction and retention of skilled professionals is key to our ongoing success. We invest significant resources in maintaining a culture that supports the ongoing development of our workforce. This includes an integrated learning and performance management system that provides opportunities to develop and enhance skills and knowledge, and enables our employees to grow professionally and perform their duties in a safe and efficient manner. This structured training and development is intended to provide employees a consistent learning experience, and maximizes learning retention and background knowledge. We offer tuition reimbursement to promote continued professional growth for current employees, and a scholarship program for students attending universities, colleges, and technical schools in our service area to assist in developing current and future skills sets needed by our employees. We are a founding partner of the Highlands College of Montana Technological University Pre-apprentice Lineman Program. We support annual Pre-apprentice scholarships, recruit and hire suitable candidates from the program, serve as industry advisors on the program board and have donated training assets to support the program. 
Compensation
Our overarching compensation philosophy is structured to be consistent with our peers, and to align the long term interests of our employees, executives, shareholders, and customers so the pay appropriately reflects performance in achieving financial and non-financial operating objectives. 
We are committed to internal pay equity, and the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors monitors the relationship between the pay our executive officers receive and the pay our non-managerial employees receive. During 2020 and 2019, the compensation for our CEO was approximately 25 and 27 times, respectively, the compensation of our median employee.
We believe that a significant portion of an executive’s pay should be at risk in the form of performance-based incentive awards that are only paid if the individual and company performance targets are met. For 2020, approximately 78 percent of the 
targeted compensation of our CEO and about 60 percent of the targeted compensation of our other named executive officers is at risk in the form of performance-based incentive awards. Our Board of Directors establishes the metrics and targets for these incentive awards, based upon advice from the Board’s independent compensation consultant.
We engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our compensation and benefits programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry. 
Diversity
 A diverse and inclusive workforce adds value to our company and helps us succeed in an ever-changing environment. By embracing diversity and fostering inclusion, we aim to enable each employee, executive, and director to contribute fully to the company. We believe diversity is important because varied perspectives expand our ability to bring unique professional experiences to our business. Diversity in the workforce may be considered when relevant to hiring, promotions, work assignments, or other decisions related to the terms and conditions of employment. Our workforce reflects the relative diversity of our available talent in the communities we serve. Our employment data is tested annually by a third party as part of our Affirmative Action plan development to identify any needed corrective placement goals that are required. This testing determined that there is no current need to establish corrective placement goals in our plan.
Of our total workforce, 28 percent of our employees are female, and 24 percent of our employees in management positions are female, including three of our eight executive officers. Additionally, 2020 Women on Boards has recognized our gender diversity, with four females among our ten directors who sit on our board. We have implemented methods to provide pay equity between our female and male employees performing equal or substantially similar work. We have engaged with a third party to review our pay equity between our male and female employees, share the results with our Board of Directors, and take corrective action as necessary. Our most recent study was performed in 2019, with no corrective action required. 
Health and Safety
As stewards of critical infrastructure, providers of energy service, and members of the communities we serve, our priority is the health and safety of our employees and customers. Safety and health are considered and integrated into all work activities. We monitor several different key areas relating to safety to review and evaluate our operations, to measure progress, and to enhance compliance with our safety philosophies and policies. These key metrics include the recordable incident rate (number of work-related injuries per 100 employees for a one-year period) and lost time incident rate (number of employees who lost time due to work-related injuries per 100 employees for a one-year period). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we realized our best safety year on record and reduced our recordable incident rate from 1.86 to 1.36 and lost time incident rate from 0.58 to 0.39 on a company wide basis as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Our five-year average safety record for the year ended December 31, 2020 was better than our industry peer group's five-year average. 
COVID-19
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic we have implemented a number of protocols to help slow the spread of the virus to protect both our employees and our communities, and to continue to provide our customers with reliable, safe energy service. We have restricted access to all our critical facilities to essential employees only, and employees in these facilities have been split into segregated work groups to avoid physical contact. We have implemented a responsible re-entry plan that determines when employees can return to company facilities in a phased approach based on internal and external triggers to provide for the safety and health of our employees. Masks and social distancing are required at all times when entering company facilities and in common spaces. Field personnel are still performing operations and maintenance work, but extra social distancing protocols have been implemented. Field personnel will not enter a customer home or business except in very limited circumstances. In an instance where an employee does need to enter a home or business, extra precautions have been implemented.
We have continuously executed upon our commitment to provide safe reliable energy service, while also managing the spread of the virus and promoting health and safety. During this time we did not lay off or furlough any employees. We implemented and continue to provide paid leave programs supplemental to our paid-time off and leave benefits, which compensate employees when unable to work due to quarantine and illness.
