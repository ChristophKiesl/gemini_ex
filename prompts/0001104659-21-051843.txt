Our Corporate History and Background
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 7, 2008. From inception through December 31, 2014, our primary business purpose was to stockpile indium, a specialty metal that is used as a raw material in a wide variety of consumer electronics manufacturing applications. As of December 31, 2014, we sold all the indium from our stockpile. As a result, at such time we were no longer in the business of purchasing and selling indium. In 2015, our Board of Directors approved a cash distribution to our stockholders and a share repurchase program. After completion of the cash distribution and the share repurchase program the Company sought a new growth platform and focused on its current strategy of acquiring and growing operating businesses.

Domestic Industry Overview by Business
 
Transportation Services Business
 
Heavy Haul
 
A heavy haul or oversize load is a load that exceeds the standard or ordinary legal size and/or weight limits for a truck to convey on a specified portion of road, highway, or other transport infrastructure. Also, a load that exceeds the per-axle limits, but not the overall weight limits, is considered overweight. Examples of oversize/overweight loads include construction machines (cranes, front loaders, backhoes, etc.), wind energy components, production equipment used in energy, midstream compressors, pre-built homes, power generation components, containers, and infrastructure elements (such as bridge beams and industrial equipment).
Super Heavy Haul
 
A super heavy haul is a permit-required over-dimensional load that typically exceeds 254 thousand pounds gross vehicle weight and requires specialized equipment. Examples of this type of load include refinery components, boilers, slug catchers, vessels, large natural gas compressors, large wind components for renewable energy, and transformers for the power industry.
Drilling Rig Mobilization
 
Moving a drilling rig involves mobilization of the rig’s substructure, derrick, power generation and mud and pumping equipment, and drill pipe. Typically, jobs are quoted in ten-mile increments with most mobilizations within a hundred mile radius. These moves can include cold stack rigs coming out of storage into the field.

Commodity Freight
 
Legal loads not requiring permits that include mining and drilling equipment, lumber, pipe, heavy equipment, heavy machinery, coil tubing, steel, solar panels, and generators.
 
Freight Brokerage
 
Brokerage services are utilized when an existing, or new customer has logistics needs that exceed our current scope of services or equipment and we arrange for a carrier on their behalf. This service line was recently integrated in-house in lieu of outsourcing brokerage services to a third party to raise the value to our customers.
Sold and Discontinued Businesses
 
MG Cleaners LLC
 
Our former subsidiary, MG Cleaners, which we acquired in September 2017 preformed drilling rig cleaning products and services. MG sold a line of surfactants, decreases and soaps, provided cleaning equipment including industrial pressure washers as a dealer and offered mechanic repairs and rig wash services to customers

Company Strategies
 
Buy and Build
 
Our strategy involves growth resulting from making acquisitions of private owner-operated lower or middle-market size transportation services and related businesses operating in the Southwest United States with a plan to grow them post-acquisition. Our management team seeks to identify companies that have good reputations and customers, and complementary service lines. We plan for additional growth, post-acquisition, of these targets by identifying business constraints which can be removed once acquired by us. These business constraints typically can be a lack of equipment, working capital, systems, sales force or MSAs and customer agreements. This strategy differs, in management’s view, from a “roll-up” as we do not make acquisitions just for cost saving synergies from elimination of duplicate personnel, consolidation of facilities, etc., but rather by adding personnel, capital and customers for anticipated future growth.
 
The acquisition of 5J in February 2020 added heavy haul, super heavy haul, drilling rig mobilization and commodity freight to our lines of service.
 
Diversify Existing Service Offerings
 
Our strategy of developing or adding additional lines of service such as heavy haul of bridge beams and wind energy components will diversify our business and provide enhanced service offerings to our customers. In addition, we plan to further diversify into logistics with brokerage services.
 
Add owner operator trucking companies to balance transportation business
 
For independent trucking company fleets with less than 100 tractors it can be customary to ‘lease on’ with a larger transportation firm benefitting from their back-office infrastructure, insurance policies and ancillary equipment. 5J has historically sought a balance between company owned drivers and equipment as well as owner/operators leased on. 5J can average about 100 tractors through ten to fifteen owner operators that lease on. The revenue share lease allows our owner/operators to operate more efficiently, and we do not have to carry their assets and fixed overhead creating a balance for our transportation business.
 
Cross-sell Customer Bases of Acquired Transportation Companies
 
We currently have over 200 customers, many of which are leading companies in their respective fields. Our strategy of cross-selling customer bases of acquired companies allows us to enhance our service offerings and our relationships with our customers by bringing other services to them that we develop or acquire when there is a demand.
 
Reduce upstream Oil & Gas focus
 
We have seen a reduction in hydrocarbon prices and upstream oil and gas customer activity in the domestic US. 5J’s legacy business started with drilling rig mobilization almost twenty years ago and we have strategically pivoted over the last few year reducing concentration on oil and gas markets and instead focused on infrastructure business of hauling bridge beams, wind energy components and power transformers. We believe we will likely continue to have exposure in the upstream O&G market given the geography and customers we serve, as such, our strategy is to reduce the overall percentage to a minority share of our business.
 
Divest or wind-down non-strategic businesses
 
In December 2020 we sold MG Cleaners and decided to cease the operations of Trinity Services LLC. The financial results of these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations on our consolidated financial statements in all periods presented within this filing.
 
Geographic Focus
 
Currently, a large portion of our more than 200 customers have a geographic presence in Texas. Our facilities and locations are strategically located in Houston, Tomball, Odessa, Floresville, Alice, Palestine, Victoria and Waskom, Texas. This strategy permits us to avoid the additional expense of managing operations in other areas of the US such as North Dakota or New England.
 
Our company headquarters are located in Houston, Texas.
 
Sales Channels
 
The Company’s sales plan includes utilizing employed sales personnel based in our various locations that are engaged to generate sales for the. Our sales personnel are typically compensated on a fixed base salary plus performance incentives. We also engage commission only salespersons from time to time to supplement the main employee-based sales force. We believe transportation services is a relationship-based business where sales relationships are important as well as safety record, equipment profile and quality of our employed and commission-based salespersons.
