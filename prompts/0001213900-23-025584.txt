ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General



We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on October 1, 2020, for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our “initial business combination.” While we may pursue an initial business combination in any region or sector, we have initially focused our efforts on identifying high-growth financial services and FinTech businesses with an estimated enterprise value up to $1.0 billion as targets for our initial business combination.



On October 23, 2020, Quantum Ventures, our sponsor, purchased 4,312,500 founder shares from us for $25,000, or $0.006 per share. In January 2021, Quantum Ventures sold 813,500 founder shares to Chardan Quantum and 35,000 founder shares to each of our directors, in each case at the original price per share, resulting in Quantum Ventures holding a balance of 3,254,000 founder shares. On February 4, 2021, we effected a stock dividend of 718,750 shares with respect to our common stock, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 5,031,250 founder shares.



The registration statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-252226 and 333-252761) for our initial public offering were declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 4, 2021. On February 9, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 17,500,000 units at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $175,000,000. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and one redeemable warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one half-share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per full share. On February 12, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, resulting in our issuance of an additional 2,625,000 units at a public offering price of $10.00 per unit. After giving effect to the exercise and close of the option, an aggregate of 20,125,000 units have been issued in the initial public offering, with aggregate gross proceeds of $201,250,000.



Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 4,450,000 private warrants to Quantum Ventures and 1,112,500 private warrants to Chardan Quantum, in each case at a price of $1.00 per private warrant, generating gross proceeds of $5,562,500. In connection with the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, Quantum Ventures purchased an additional 472,500 private warrants and Chardan Quantum purchased an additional 118,125 private warrants, in each case, at a price of $1.00 per private warrant, generating additional gross proceeds of $590,625.



A total of $201,250,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in our initial public offering and the sale of the private placements, including as a result of the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders (the “trust account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and has been invested only in U.S. government treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) and which invest solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except for all interest income that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations and for dissolution expenses up to $100,000, as applicable, none of the funds held in the trust account will be released from the trust account until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of our initial business combination by August 9, 2022 (or February 9, 2023, as applicable) if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination by August 9, 2022 (as further extended to up to August 9, 2023 pursuant to the charter Amendment), and (ii) a redemption to public stockholders prior to any voluntary winding-up in the event we do not consummate our initial business combination within the applicable period.



We incurred $5,017,526 in transaction costs, including $4,528,125 of underwriting fees and $489,401 of other offering costs. In addition, a marketing fee of $7,043,750 is payable to Chardan pursuant to a Business Combination Marketing Agreement.



Our units began trading on February 5, 2021 on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “QFTA.U.” Commencing on March 10, 2021, the shares of common stock and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on the NYSE under the symbols “QFTA” and “QFTA WS,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “QFTA.U.” On October 31, 2022, the warrants ceased trading on the NYSE and now trade on the OTC under the symbol “QFTAW.”

Significant Events and Transactions




Proposed AtlasClear Business Combination



On November 16, 2022, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) by and among us, Calculator New Pubco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“New Pubco”), Calculator Merger Sub 1, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Pubco (“Merger Sub 1”), Calculator Merger Sub 2, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Pubco (“Merger Sub 2”), AtlasClear, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“AtlasClear”), Atlas FinTech Holdings Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Atlas FinTech”) and Robert McBey. The Business Combination Agreement was unanimously approved by our board of directors (the “Board”) based upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of independent directors. If the Business Combination Agreement is approved by our stockholders, and the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement are consummated, (i) Merger Sub 1 will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Pubco and (ii) Merger Sub 2 will merge with and into AtlasClear, with AtlasClear continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Pubco (collectively, the “Business Combination”).



Prior to the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), AtlasClear will receive certain assets from Atlas FinTech and Atlas Financial Technologies Corp., will complete the acquisition of broker-dealer Wilson-Davis & Co., Inc. (“WDCO”) and will consummate a transaction with Pacsquare Technologies, LLC (“Pacsquare”). In addition, at Closing, the definitive agreement pursuant to which AtlasClear has agreed to acquire Commercial Bancorp, a Wyoming corporation (“CB”) shall continue to be in full force and effect (the “CB Merger Agreement”). The Company expects the Closing to occur before the closing of the transactions contemplated by the CB Merger Agreement (the “CB Closing”). At the Closing, AtlasClear stockholders will receive merger consideration in shares of New Pubco common stock equal to the quotient of (i) $75.4 million, less the purchase prices for WDCO and CB, divided by (ii) $10. In addition, the AtlasClear stockholders will receive up to 5,944,444 shares of New Pubco common stock (the “Earn Out Shares”). The Earn Out Shares will be issued to AtlasClear stockholders upon certain milestones (based on the achievement of certain price targets of New Pubco common stock following the Closing). In the event such milestones are not met within the first 18 months following the Closing, the Earn Out Shares will be cancelled. Atlas FinTech will also receive up to $20 million of New Pubco common stock (“Software Products Earn Out Shares”), which will be issued to Atlas FinTech upon certain milestones based on the achievement of certain revenue targets of software products contributed to AtlasClear by Atlas FinTech and Atlas Financial Technologies Corp. following the Closing. The revenue targets will be measured yearly for the five years following Closing, with no catch-up between the years.



Refer to Note 6 of our financial statements for further details on the Business Combination. 



Termination of TradeStation Merger Agreement



We previously entered into a merger agreement with TradeStation Group, Inc. (“TradeStation”) on November 4, 2021, as amended on December 17, 2021 and April 28, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”). On August 2, 2022, we received a notice from TradeStation that purported to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01(c) thereof. Section 12.01(c) provided that the Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party if the merger of the Company with Merger Sub had not occurred on or before August 1, 2022 (the “Termination Date”); provided that such termination right was not available to any party whose breach of any provision of the Merger Agreement had been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of the closing of the business combination to occur on or before such date. On August 2, 2022, we sent a letter to TradeStation stating that TradeStation was not permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01(c) because TradeStation’s breaches of, and failure to perform under, the Merger Agreement were the primary cause of the failure of the closing of the business combination to occur on or before the Termination Date. On November 15, 2022, we sent a notice to TradeStation terminating the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 12.01(b) thereof.

Extension of SPAC Liquidation Date



On February 6, 2023, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which we have to consummate a business combination for an additional six months to up to August 9, 2023, by electing to extend on a monthly basis for up to six times, provided that Quantum Ventures (or its affiliates or permitted designees) deposit into the Trust Account an amount determined by multiplying $0.055 by the number of public shares then outstanding, up to a maximum of $175,000 for each one-month extension. In connection with the stockholder meeting, 14,667,626 stockholders properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.13 per share, resulting in a total final aggregate redemption amount of approximately $148.5 million, leaving approximately $55.3 million in the Trust Account.



Business Strategy



We intend to identify high growth FinTech acquisition targets by leveraging the expertise of our management team. Our management team maintains robust deal sourcing channels and industry-leading relationships across the FinTech landscape.



NYSE rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects.



We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of NYSE’s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.



In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry.

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our co-sponsors, officers or directors, nor are we prohibited from partnering, submitting joint bids, or entering into any similar transaction with our co-sponsors, or an affiliate of our co-sponsors, in the pursuit of an initial business combination. If we seek to complete an initial business combination with such a company or we partner with our co-sponsors, or any of their affiliates in our pursuit of an initial business combination, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, and reasonably acceptable to Chardan, with respect to fair market value that the business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view.



If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Certain of our directors currently have relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.



Acquisition Criteria



Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating a prospective business target. We utilize these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but these are not intended to be exhaustive and management will independently review the merits of an initial business combination. No individual criterion will entirely determine a decision to pursue an opportunity, but we intend to acquire companies that we believe:

● | Are high-growth FinTech businesses which operate within large and expanding markets with significant whitespace opportunity; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Are of meaningful scale and whose products and/or services are materially differentiated from competitors creating meaningful barriers to entry for new competitors; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Operate a superior unit economic model which either currently or over time are expected to generate profitable, stable and predictable cash flow generation for the business; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Are at a capital inflection point where significant risk-adjusted shareholder value can be generated through a business combination and resulting access to the broader equity capital markets to drive growth; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Possess a best-in-class management team with a track record of success in driving growth and profitability within FinTech market; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintain superior and scalable risk management, underwriting, data analytics, monitoring and reporting processes; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Promote financial inclusion and provide significant value to the underlying end consumer or enterprise through a lowering of transaction costs or through providing access to high-quality scalable financial services. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we have encountered intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriters’ fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.

Employees



We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they have and will continue to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
Our Website



Our corporate website address is www.qftacorp.com. The information contained on, or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information



We have registered our units, shares of common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.



We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, the financial information included in the proxy solicitation materials will need to be prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards, or IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board or the IASB, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. The financial statements may also be required to be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for the Form 8-K announcing the closing of an initial business combination, which would need to be filed within four business days thereafter. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial information. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.



We are required to comply with the internal control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act beginning for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
