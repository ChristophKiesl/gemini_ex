The Rejuvenated Uniform Segment
 
In April 2015, we entered into a joint venture and license agreement with Pure Systems International, Ltd. to produce and market garments and other accessories for the commercial uniform marketplace and other market verticals by utilizing Pure Systems International, Ltd.’s patented processes to up-cycle pre-consumer textile waste into reusable fiber of equal or better quality than the original fabric.

In May of 2015, the Company created a new limited liability company, Pure361, LLC (“Pure361”) of which the Company owns 51% and Pure Systems International, Ltd. owns 49%. Pure361 has the exclusive licensee to use Pure System International Ltd.’s patented Rejuvenated Fiber in conjunction with the commercial uniform marketplace and other market verticals.
 
Ms Joy Nunn, the company’s former CTO and Board member resigned as of February 14, 2017, but the company still maintains a license with Pure System International, Ltd.
 
To further strengthen its capabilities in the Rejuvenated Uniform segment the Company has identified alternative technologies to those under license from Pure Systems. The company will be developing customers using this alternative technology by working with equipment vendors and toll manufacturers to produce sales samples.
 
The Rejuvenated Cardboard Segment
 
In conjunction with its focus on rejuvenated technologies, the Company is exploring the possibility of also manufacturing a rejuvenated cardboard product, and is in the early stages of exploring this potential opportunity.
Competition
 
In the uniform and related products segment, we will compete with many firms, including corporations with large divisions, many of these companies have great financial, technical or marketing resources, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition or larger customer bases than we do and may be able to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can. The nature and degree of competition varies with the customer and the market. Industry statistics are not available.
 
Competitive pricing may require us to reduce our future prices, which would impact future profitability or result in lost sales. Our competitors, many of whom have greater resources than we do, may be better able to withstand these price reductions and lost sales.
