 Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel bile acid modulators to treat orphan pediatric liver diseases and other liver or gastrointestinal, or GI, diseases and disorders. The initial target indication for our lead product candidate, odevixibat (formerly known as A4250), is progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, or PFIC, a rare, life-threatening genetic disorder affecting young children for which there is currently no approved drug treatment. We are also pursuing the development of odevixibat in biliary atresia and in Alagille syndrome, or ALGS, each of which is a rare, life threatening disease that affects the liver and for which there is no approved pharmacologic treatment option. We plan to initiate a pivotal clinical trial of odevixibat in biliary atresia in the first half of 2020 and expect to initiate a pivotal trial of odevixibat in ALGS by the end of 2020. Our most advanced product candidate in addition to odevixibat is elobixibat, which is approved in Japan for the treatment of chronic constipation and for which we have initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial as a treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. We expect topline results from the Phase 2 trial in mid-2020. We also expect topline results from another Phase 2 trial in NASH, being conducted in Japan and sponsored by our partner EA Pharma, at the end of 2020 or early 2021. We are also exploring development options for our product candidate A3384 based on an evaluation of its patent coverage and our overall portfolio. We have method of use patents for odevixibat with a natural expiry in 2031, but which can run through 2034 with potential patent term extensions. In June 2018, we were granted a patent for a method of using elobixibat to treat NASH in both the U.S. and E.U. We also have a preclinical program in adult liver diseases, including NASH.
 Odevixibat —our lead product candidate for PFIC.    We completed enrollment in PEDFIC 1, a pivotal clinical trial of odevixibat given once per day as an oral capsule or sprinkled over food, in children ages 6 months to 18 years with PFIC types 1 and 2. PEDFIC 1 is testing two doses of odevixibat, 40 µg/kg/day and 120 µg/kg/day, along with placebo, over a treatment period of 24 weeks. In PEDFIC 1, assessment of change in pruritus is the primary endpoint in the U.S. and a key secondary endpoint in the E.U., and sBA responder rate is the primary endpoint in the E.U. and a key secondary endpoint in the U.S. We are using the planned commercial formulation in PEDFIC 1, but any commercial product will include final trade dress. In the first quarter of 2019, we revised our statistical analysis methodology for PEDFIC 1, in line with guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which resulted in an improvement in the power of the study. Patients have the option to rollover into an open label extension study, PEDFIC 2, and we now have patients on study medication for well over a year.  We are also enrolling patients in an additional cohort of PEDFIC 2 who were not eligible for PEDFIC1. We expect topline data from PEDFIC 1 in mid-2020, with a potential approval and commercial launch in the second half of 2021. In June 2018, the FDA granted a rare pediatric disease designation to odevixibat for the treatment of PFIC, which affirms our eligibility to apply for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher upon submission of a new drug application for odevixibat. In September 2018, the FDA granted fast track designation for odevixibat for the treatment of pruritus associated with PFIC. 
 The precise prevalence of PFIC is unknown, and we are not aware of any patient registries or other method of establishing with precision the actual number of patients with PFIC in any geography. PFIC has been estimated to affect between one in every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide. Based on the published incidence, published regional populations, and estimated median life expectancies, we estimate the prevalence of PFIC across the spectrum of the disease to be approximately 8,000 to 10,000 patients in the U.S. and E.U., but we are not able to estimate the prevalence of PFIC with precision. We currently have not modeled other regional opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and Latin

America. We are aware there may be higher prevalence of disease in some countries such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey. We hold global rights to odevixibat unencumbered. Our current plan is to commercialize odevixibat ourselves in the U.S. and E.U., and we have begun the process of identifying potential partners for other regions. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of PFIC. First-line treatment for PFIC is typically off-label ursodeoxycholic acid, or UDCA, which is approved in the U.S. and elsewhere for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC. However, many PFIC patients do not respond well to UDCA, undergo partial external bile diversion, or PEBD, surgery and often require liver transplantation. PEBD surgery is a life-altering and undesirable procedure in which bile is drained outside the body to a stoma bag that must be worn by the patient 24 hours a day.
 Other indications under development for odevixibat.
 We are also pursuing the development of odevixibat in patients with biliary atresia, another rare, life-threatening disease that affects the liver and for which there is no approved pharmacologic treatment option. In December 2018, the European Commission granted orphan designation to odevixibat for the treatment of biliary atresia, and in January 2019, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to odevixibat for the treatment of biliary atresia. The FDA has cleared our investigational new drug application, or IND, for a global pivotal trial in biliary atresia, which we plan to initiate in the first half of 2020, with full site activation planned for the first half of 2021. We believe biliary atresia is one of the most common rare pediatric liver diseases, and is the leading cause of liver transplants in children. Our double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal trial in biliary atresia is designed to enroll approximately 200 patients at 70 sites globally. Patients will receive either placebo or high-dose (120µg/kg) odevixibat once daily. The primary endpoint is survival with native liver after two years of treatment.
     Biliary atresia is a partial or total blocking or absence of large bile ducts that causes cholestasis and resulting accumulation of bile that damages the liver. The estimated worldwide incidence of biliary atresia is between 4.5 and 8.5 for every 100,000 live births. We estimate the prevalence of biliary atresia to be approximately 15,000 to 20,000 patients in the U.S. and E.U., but we are not able to estimate the prevalence of biliary atresia with precision. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of biliary atresia. The current standard of care is a surgery known as the Kasai procedure, or hepatoportoenterostomy, in which the obstructed bile ducts are removed and a section of the small intestine is connected to the liver directly. However, only an estimated 25% of those initially undergoing the Kasai procedure will survive to their twenties without need for liver transplantation. 
     In addition, we have been evaluating a pivotal study design for odevixibat in ALGS and following a scheduled consultation with the FDA in the first quarter of 2020, we plan to initiate the trial by the end of 2020. ALGS is a genetic condition associated with liver, heart, eye, kidney and skeletal abnormalities. In particular, ALGS patients have fewer than normal bile ducts inside the liver, which leads to cholestasis and the accumulation of bile and causes scarring in the liver. ALGS is estimated to affect between one in every 30,000 to 70,000 children born worldwide. We estimate the prevalence of ALGS to be approximately 3,000 to 5,000 patients in the U.S. and E.U., but we are not able to estimate the prevalence of ALGS with precision. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of ALGS. Current treatment for ALGS is generally in line with current treatments for PFIC as described above. In August 2012, the European Commission granted orphan designation to odevixibat for the treatment of ALGS. In October 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to odevixibat for the treatment of ALGS.
     We continue to evaluate potential clinical development in other indications, including primary sclerosing cholangitis, which refers to swelling (inflammation), scarring, and destruction of bile ducts inside and outside of the liver. The first symptoms are typically fatigue, itching and jaundice, and many patients with sclerosing cholangitis also suffer from inflammatory bowel disease. The estimated incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis is 6.3 cases per 100,000 people. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of sclerosing cholangitis. First-line treatment is typically off-label UDCA, although UDCA has not been established to be safe and effective in patients with sclerosing cholangitis in well controlled clinical trials.

 Elobixibat as a potential treatment for NASH.   
     NASH is a common, serious and sometimes fatal chronic liver disease that resembles alcoholic liver disease but occurs in people who drink little or no alcohol. Based on multiple epidemiological studies published by third parties in 2014 and 2015, we estimate that NASH affects 2 to 3.5% of adults, representing over 9 million people in the United States and 10 million people in the European Union. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of NASH. Lifestyle changes, including modification of diet and exercise to reduce body weight, as well as treatment of concomitant diabetes and dyslipidemia, are commonly accepted as the standard of care for NASH, but have not conclusively been shown to prevent disease progression. Based on findings on parameters relevant to NASH in clinical trials of elobixibat that we previously conducted in patients with chronic constipation and in patients with elevated cholesterol and findings on other parameters relevant to NASH from nonclinical studies that we previously conducted with elobixibat or a different IBAT inhibitor, we believe elobixibat has potential benefit in the treatment of NASH. We initiated our Phase 2 clinical trial of elobixibat in NAFLD and NASH, with the first patients enrolled in June 2019.   We expect to have topline results from the Phase 2 trial in mid-2020. We also expect topline results from another Phase 2 study in NASH, being conducted in Japan and sponsored by our partner EA Pharma, at the end of 2020 or early 2021.
     A3384 — a product candidate for the potential treatment of other gastrointestinal diseases or disorders.
 A3384 is a proprietary formulation of cholestyramine, a well characterized bile acid sequestrant, which is also known as resin, that is designed to release cholestyramine directly in the colon. We obtained formulation-related patents in the U.S. with respect to A3384 in October 2019. We are exploring development options for A3384 based on an evaluation of its patent coverage and our overall portfolio.
 Preclinical Program — novel bile acid modulators.
 We have an ongoing preclinical program directed towards discovering and advancing to the clinic novel compounds that modulate bile acid levels to treat adult liver diseases including NASH. We are pleased to have selected a lead candidate from our compound library, filed for new patents and established plans to complete IND enabling studies in 2020.  We plan to provide more details on the specific mechanism of action and our progress in the future.
 Our Corporate History
  Prior to November 3, 2016, we were a specialty biopharmaceutical company known as Biodel Inc. that historically had been focused on the development and commercialization of innovative treatments for diabetes. Biodel was originally incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 2003 under the name “Global Positioning Group, Ltd.” and subsequently changed its name to “Biodel Inc.” Albireo Limited was formed in connection with a spinout transaction from AstraZeneca AB in 2008 in which AstraZeneca assigned to Albireo AB all of its rights in and to its portfolio of IBAT inhibitors, including elobixibat and odevixibat, as well as other programs that are currently at a preclinical stage.
 On November 3, 2016, we completed a share exchange transaction with Biodel Inc, pursuant to an Amended and Restated Share Exchange Agreement dated July 13, 2016 that we entered into with Albireo Limited and the shareholders and noteholders of Albireo Limited. As a result, Albireo Limited became a wholly owned subsidiary of Biodel, Biodel’s corporate name was changed to Albireo Pharma, Inc. and the business of Albireo Limited became our business.
 The Role of Bile Acids and IBAT
 The liver is responsible for many vital body functions, including the regulation of bile acid synthesis and metabolism. The liver uses cholesterol to produce bile acids, which are then transported to, and stored in, the gall bladder. In response to food ingestion, the gall bladder contracts and releases bile acids into the small intestine where they promote digestion and absorption of dietary fats and fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K.

 After completing digestion, bile acids bind to IBAT, which is sometimes referred to as the apical sodium bile acid transporter, or ASBT, at a location at the end of the small intestine known as the terminal ileum. As depicted below, IBAT then initiates the transport of bile acids across the intestinal wall through the portal vein back to the liver in the enterohepatic circulation process.

 In healthy persons, approximately 95% of bile acids recirculate back to the liver, with the remainder being excreted to the colon. The liver produces a small amount of new bile acids every day to make up for this loss.
 In addition to their role in digestion, bile acids are important signaling molecules that help regulate a network of metabolic pathways throughout the GI system. Bile acids bind to receptors in the colon that promote the release of intestinal hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide‑1, or GLP‑1, that can stimulate insulin release from the pancreas and, over time, decrease levels of plasma hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c, a measure of glucose. In the liver, bile acids bind to other receptors that regulate bile acid production from cholesterol. Under normal conditions, bile acids bind to these receptors and inhibit the synthesis of new bile acids. As bile acid levels are lowered, the liver produces needed bile acids from cholesterol, which requires increased uptake of cholesterol and results in the decrease of cholesterol levels in the liver and otherwise in circulation in the body.
 Cholestatic liver disease results in the accumulation of elevated bile acids in the liver and in the serum. Elevated bile acid levels are linked with progressive liver disease. In addition, although a direct causative correlation has not been definitely established, there is substantial clinical support linking elevated serum bile acids to pruritus, a challenging symptom impacting patients with cholestatic liver disease.
 Interruption of enterohepatic circulation in patients with PFIC or ALGS surgically via the partial external biliary diversion, or PEBD, procedure has been shown to lower serum bile acid levels, relieve pruritus, improve clinical outcomes and delay the progression of serious liver disease. Odevixibat is designed to treat PFIC and other cholestatic liver diseases pharmacologically by inhibiting IBAT to reduce bile acids in the liver and serum, while at the same time reducing pruritus. In addition to the beneficial effects that may be achievable through IBAT inhibition, odevixibat is minimally absorbed into the bloodstream, resulting in minimal systemic exposure of the drug to the body.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for orphan pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders where there is high unmet medical need, while also leveraging our expertise in 

 
  7
 
bile acid modulation to treat other liver and GI diseases and disorders. To achieve our goal, we intend to pursue the following strategies.

· | Rapidly develop odevixibat to regulatory approval to treat patients with PFIC. We are conducting a single Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with PFIC, which we refer to as PEDFIC 1. It is our objective that PEDFIC 1, together with available data from PEDFIC 2, our long-term, open label extension study, forms the primary support for applications for marketing approval of odevixibat in both the United States and European Union.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maximize the benefit and commercial potential of odevixibat by expanding development to additional orphan pediatric cholestatic indications. Although we have chosen PFIC as our lead indication for odevixibat, we also believe odevixibat can benefit children suffering from other cholestatic diseases and disorders. We plan to initiate a pivotal clinical trial with odevixibat for the treatment of biliary atresia in the first half of 2020. We estimate biliary atresia impacts an aggregate of 15,000 to 20,000 patients in the United States and European Union, and is the cause of over 50% of liver transplants in children. After further input to be received from the FDA in the first quarter of 2020, we also plan to initiate a pivotal trial for odevixibat as a treatment for ALGS by the end of 2020. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Develop the capability to commercialize odevixibat to treat orphan pediatric liver diseases, if approved, through a targeted sales force in the United States and Europe and collaborate selectively to commercialize odevixibat outside of these regions. If we receive marketing approval in the United States or Europe for odevixibat to treat patients with PFIC or any other pediatric cholestatic liver disease or disorder, we plan to build the capabilities to effectively commercialize odevixibat in the approved indication(s) in the applicable region. We believe that the required commercial organization would be modest in size and targeted to the relatively small number of specialists in the United States and Europe who treat children with cholestatic liver disease. If we receive marketing approval outside of the United States and Europe for odevixibat to treat patients with PFIC or any other pediatric cholestatic liver disease or disorder, we plan to selectively utilize collaboration, distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize odevixibat in the approved indication(s) in the regions or markets where we receive approval.

· | Collaborate selectively to develop and commercialize product candidates targeting nonorphan indications, potentially including elobixibat, A3384 or any future product candidate to treat NASH. We intend to selectively seek alliances and collaborations to assist us in furthering the development or commercialization of product candidates targeting large primary care markets that must be served by large sales and marketing organizations. These product candidates may include any or all of elobixibat, A3384, and any potential future product candidate that arises from our preclinical program in NASH.

 Our Pipeline

     Odevixibat
 We fully enrolled a pivotal clinical trial of odevixibat in children with PFIC, and these patients are eligible to enroll in an extension study to evaluate long-term outcomes. In addition to PFIC, we plan to initiate a pivotal clinical trial in biliary atresia in the first half of 2020.  Following consultation with the FDA in the first quarter of 2020, we also plan to initiate what we expect will be a pivotal trial for odevixibat as a treatment for ALGS by the end of 2020.  
 Odevixibat is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of IBAT that is designed to reduce bile acid reabsorption from the small intestine to the liver, and therefore reduce levels of bile acids in the serum and liver and increase excretion of bile acids via the colon. We believe that reducing liver and serum bile acid levels may reduce bile acid-related liver damage to improve liver function and alleviate symptoms of PFIC and other cholestatic liver diseases, including pruritus. Moreover, at therapeutic doses, odevixibat has minimal systemic exposure, acts locally in the gut and, based on preclinical testing, appears to be excreted substantially intact in the feces, which may reduce the risk of systemic side effects and undesirable drug-drug interactions compared with drugs that have broad distribution in the body. Odevixibat has been granted orphan drug designation for PFIC, PBC, biliary atresia and ALGS in the United States and the European Union. 
 Lead Indication for Odevixibat
 PFIC. PFIC is our lead indication for odevixibat. PFIC is a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive, life-threatening liver disease, which may start early after birth or at a young age and rapidly progress to end-stage liver disease. PFIC is commonly associated with elevated serum bile acids. Prominent symptoms of PFIC include pruritus, which is associated with severe sleep disturbance and diminished overall quality of life, and poor growth. First-line treatment in PFIC is typically off-label UDCA. UDCA is itself a type of bile acid that is thought to act by diluting the toxic effects in the liver and bile ducts of a different type of bile acids, known as hydrophobic bile acids, which are often elevated in cholestatic liver disease. Third-party retrospective analyses published in 2009 and 2010 indicate that, following treatment with UDCA, many PFIC patients require PEBD surgery and PFIC patients will often ultimately require liver transplantation. Although success rates vary, published third-party studies have shown that PEBD surgery can slow and, in some cases, stop the progression of liver disease and lead to reduced pruritus and improved sleep. We believe these outcomes validate our approach of reducing liver and serum bile acids with an IBAT inhibitor such as odevixibat to treat PFIC.

 The precise prevalence of PFIC is unknown, and we are not aware of any patient registries or other method of establishing with precision the actual number of patients with PFIC in any geography. PFIC has been estimated to affect between one in every 50,000 to 100,000 children born worldwide. Based on the published incidence, published regional populations, and estimated median life expectancies, we estimate the prevalence of PFIC across the spectrum of the disease to be approximately 8,000 to 10,000 patients in the U.S. and E.U., but we are not able to estimate the prevalence of PFIC with precision. We currently have not modeled other regional opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. We are aware there may be higher prevalence of disease in some countries such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey. We hold global rights to odevixibat unencumbered. Our current plan is to commercialize odevixibat ourselves in the U.S. and E.U., and we have begun the process of identifying potential partners for other regions. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of PFIC. First-line treatment for PFIC is typically off-label ursodeoxycholic acid, or UDCA, which is approved in the United States and elsewhere for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC. However, many PFIC patients do not respond well to UDCA, undergo partial external bile diversion, or PEBD, surgery and often require liver transplantation. PEBD surgery is a life-altering and undesirable procedure in which bile is drained outside the body to a stoma bag that must be worn by the patient 24 hours a day. Three alternative gene defects have been identified that correlate to three separate PFIC subtypes, known as types 1, 2 and 3.

· | PFIC, type 1, which is sometimes referred to as “Byler disease” or “FIC1 deficiency,” is caused by impaired bile secretion due to mutations in the ATP8B1 gene that result in an imbalance of molecules known as phospholipids that is associated with cholestasis and elevated bile acids in the liver. Children affected by PFIC, type 1 usually develop cholestasis in the first months of life and, in the absence of surgical treatment, progress to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease before the end of the first decade of life. PFIC, type 1 is especially common in the Old Order Amish population in the United States, as well as the Inuit population of Greenland.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | PFIC, type 2, which is sometimes referred to as “Byler syndrome” or “BSEP deficiency,” is caused by impaired bile salt secretion due to mutations in the ABCB11 gene that result in the buildup of bile salts in liver cells. Children with PFIC, type 2 often develop liver failure within the first few years of life and are at increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common form of liver cancer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | PFIC, type 3, which typically presents in the first years of childhood with progressive cholestasis, is caused by mutations in the ABCB4 gene. Mutations in the ABCB4 gene lead to a lack of phospholipids available to bind to bile acids, resulting in a buildup of bile acids that damages liver cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The TJP2 gene, NR1H4 gene or Myo5b gene mutations have also been proposed to be causes of PFIC. In addition, some patients with PFIC do not have a mutation in any of the ATP8B1, ABCB11, ABCB4, TJP2, NR1H4 or Myo5b genes. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown.
 Biliary Atresia Indication for Odevixibat
 Biliary atresia. Biliary atresia is a partial or total blocking or absence of large bile ducts that irreversibly prevents bile flow from the liver to the small intestine, causing cholestasis and resulting accumulation of bile that damages the liver. The damage leads to scarring, loss of liver tissue and cirrhosis, which makes it difficult for the liver to remove toxins from the blood and deteriorates the liver. Biliary atresia is life threatening.
 There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of biliary atresia. The current standard of care is the Kasai procedure. The chance of a successful Kasai procedure is highest if performed before a patient is two months of age. However, even with early intervention, scarring of the liver can continue, resulting in cirrhosis and eventually the need for transplantation. Only an estimated 25% of those initially undergoing the Kasai procedure will survive to their twenties without need for liver transplantation.
 The estimated worldwide incidence of biliary atresia is between 4.5 and 8.5 for every 100,000 live births . Of all biliary atresia patients, we believe odevixibat will primarily benefit those who have undergone a Kasai procedure that has been sufficiently successful to obviate the need for liver transplant within the first year of life. We estimate the 

 
  10
 
prevalence of biliary atresia to be approximately 15,000 to 20,000 patients in the U.S. and E.U., but we are not able to estimate the prevalence of biliary atresia with precision.
 The exact cause of biliary atresia is unknown, but it is thought to result from an event in the womb or around the time of birth. Possible triggers may include viral or bacterial infection, an immune system malfunction, a genetic mutation, a problem during liver or bile duct development or exposure to toxic substances. In January of 2019, the FDA granted orphan designation to odevixibat for the treatment of biliary atresia. The European Commission granted orphan drug designation to odevixibat for the treatment of biliary atresia in December of 2018.  We plan to initiate a pivotal clinical trial in biliary atresia in  the first half of 2020. Our double-blind, placebo controlled pivotal trial in biliary atresia is designed to enroll approximately 200 patients at 70 sites globally. Patients will receive either placebo or 120µg/kg) odevixibat once daily. The primary endpoint is survival with native liver after two years of treatment.
 Potential Additional Target Indications for Odevixibat
 ALGS. ALGS is a genetic condition associated with liver, heart, eye, kidney and skeletal abnormalities. In particular, ALGS patients have fewer than normal bile ducts inside the liver, which leads to cholestasis and the accumulation of bile and causes scarring in the liver. Symptoms include jaundice, pruritus, poor growth and specific facial features and typically develop in the first two years of life.
 There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of ALGS. Current treatments for ALGS are generally in line with current treatments for PFIC as described above, including off-label UDCA, PEBD surgery and, where liver disease is advanced, liver transplantation. 
 The prevalence of ALGS has been estimated to be one in every 30,000 to 70,000 newborns born worldwide. ALGS is predominately caused by mutations in a gene called Jagged1. In a small number of cases, ALGS results from mutations in a gene called Notch2. In October of 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to odevixibat for the treatment of ALGS. After further consultation with the FDA scheduled in the first quarter of 2020, we also plan to initiate a what we expect will be a pivotal trial for odevixibat as a treatment for ALGS by the end of 2020. 
 Primary Sclerosing cholangitis. Primary sclerosing cholangitis refers to swelling (inflammation), scarring, and destruction of bile ducts inside and outside of the liver. The first symptoms are typically fatigue, itching and jaundice, and many patients with sclerosing cholangitis also suffer from inflammatory bowel disease. The estimated incidence of primary sclerosing cholangitis is 6.3 cases per 100,000 people. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of sclerosing cholangitis. First-line treatment is typically off-label UDCA, although UDCA has not been established to be safe and effective in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis in well controlled clinical trials.
 Development of Odevixibat
 Preclinical and Phase 1 Clinical Development
 To assess the preclinical efficacy of odevixibat to treat cholestasis, we studied odevixibat in a mouse model in which select genes had been removed from the mice to induce cholestatic liver injury. In the model, odevixibat significantly reduced serum levels of bile acids and normalized levels of alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, and alkaline phosphatase, or ALP, which are enzymes in the liver that are elevated in a diseased liver. Odevixibat also significantly inhibited the expression of proteins known to be associated with inflammation, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf- a), vascular cell adhesion molecule‑1 (Vcam‑1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein‑1 (Mcp‑1), and proteins known to be associated with fibrosis, including collagen, type 1 alpha1 (Col1a1) and collagen, type 1 alpha2 (Col1a2).
 In addition, we completed a placebo controlled Phase 1 clinical trial of odevixibat in healthy volunteers. The trial enrolled a total of 104 subjects and had three parts — a single ascending dose phase evaluating five different doses of odevixibat, a multiple ascending dose phase evaluating three different doses of odevixibat (a 1 mg dose once daily, a 3 mg dose once daily and a 1.5 mg dose twice daily) over seven days, and a multiple ascending dose phase evaluating odevixibat in combination with a bile acid sequestrant over seven days.

 
  11
 

 Odevixibat was generally well tolerated in all dose groups in the trial. In addition, odevixibat was associated with a variety of biological effects, including a dose-related reduction in serum bile acids, decreased levels of the protein Fibroblast Growth Factor 19, or FGF19, and increased levels of the bile acid intermediate 7 a -hydroxy‑4‑cholesten‑3‑one, or C4. The effects on FGF19 and C4 levels are consistent with the IBAT inhibition mechanism, as IBAT inhibition reduces levels of bile acids in cells in the distal small intestine, which leads to decreased FGF19 production. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, and the most commonly reported adverse event was diarrhea. Based on the results of the trial, we determined to include doses up to 3 mg daily in our next clinical trials.
 Completed Phase 2 Clinical Trial in PBC
 Odevixibat was previously evaluated in an investigator-initiated Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of PBC. We facilitated the trial, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily to provide additional learning on the effects of odevixibat in patients with cholestatic liver disease to guide future development and to address feedback received from the FDA at a pre-investigational new drug, or IND, meeting regarding the need to generate data in adults with cholestatic liver disease prior to initiating clinical development in children in the United States. PBC is a chronic disease of the liver in which the bile ducts become inflamed and are slowly destroyed. When bile ducts are damaged, bile acids can build up in the liver, leading to irreversible cirrhosis. As cirrhosis progresses and the amount of scar tissue in the liver increases, the liver loses its ability to function. Cirrhosis also prevents blood from the intestines from returning to the heart.
 The trial was an open label, crossover study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of odevixibat, the efficacy of odevixibat in relieving pruritus and the effects of odevixibat on liver biochemistry and bile acid metabolism in patients with PBC and cholestatic pruritus. The investigator conducted the trial at two sites in Sweden. The trial design provided for enrollment of adult patients who had not responded adequately to at least six months of treatment with UDCA and who met specified criteria for elevated serum levels of ALP and for itching.
 In the trial, patients initially continued their existing regimen of either cholestyramine or colestipol for four weeks. After a two-week washout period, patients in the first cohort received a 1.5 mg once daily oral dose of odevixibat for one week and a 3 mg once daily oral dose of odevixibat for the succeeding three weeks. Odevixibat was administered in a powder formulation in a capsule, and patients who did not tolerate the higher dose could revert to the lower dose at the discretion of the investigator. After another two-week washout period beginning at the end of the four-week odevixibat treatment period, patients again returned to their initial dosing regimen of either cholestyramine or colestipol for four weeks.
 Following completion of the first cohort, the investigator began to enroll a second cohort of six patients into the trial to receive a lower daily dose of odevixibat than patients in the first cohort received. However, the investigator experienced recruitment delays for the second cohort and determined to conclude the study prior to completion of the second cohort, citing GI side effects.
 The primary endpoint of the trial was the incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs during the treatment period. The VAS-itch, a commonly used tool to assess pruritus based on a linear 10‑point scale, was one of the exploratory efficacy endpoints in the trial.

Based on data from the trial that we received from the investigator, eight patients received odevixibat and all of them reported a substantial reduction in pruritus, assessed by the VAS-itch scale, at the time of the first assessment (one week). The reduction in pruritus was sustained throughout the remaining period of participation in the trial with dosing with odevixibat, and pruritus levels returned to pre-odevixibat levels when dosing was stopped.
 Two of the five patients in the first cohort dropped out of the trial due to diarrhea, an effect consistent with the IBAT inhibition mechanism. Three of the four patients in the abbreviated second cohort of the trial dropped out prior to completion of the four-week dosing period due to GI side effects, including diarrhea, abdominal pain and, in one case, bleeding.

 Completed Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Children with Chronic Cholestasis and Pruritus
 Our completed Phase 2 clinical trial of odevixibat in children with chronic cholestasis and pruritus was an open label, dose finding trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of odevixibat. The chronic cholestasis was caused by one of a number of different conditions, including PFIC, biliary atresia or ALGS. We conducted the trial at six enrolling sites in Denmark, France, Germany and Sweden.
 The trial enrolled 20 patients between one and 17 years of age who met specified criteria for elevated serum bile acids and itching. Four of the 20 patients reenrolled to participate in a different dose group, resulting in a total of 24 datasets. Ten of the 20 patients had PFIC. Following screening, patients received a single oral dose of odevixibat on the first day of the trial. If pharmacokinetic assessments met objective criteria for minimal systemic exposure of odevixibat and, at a follow-up visit between 10 and 14 days later, there were no safety concerns, patients then received oral doses of odevixibat once daily for four weeks. The term “pharmacokinetic” refers to how a drug moves within the body, including its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. The trial design initially provided for six dose groups, ranging from 0.01 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg. An independent data safety and monitoring board, or DSMB, determined whether to initiate each successive dose group based on evaluation of safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data from the preceding dose group. Odevixibat was administered in the trial as pellets contained in a gelatin capsule that could be either swallowed whole or opened, enabling the pellets to be sprinkled on and mixed in food such as yogurt. This pellet formulation was different from the powder formulation used in the investigator-initiated clinical trial in PBC and prior clinical trials described above.
 The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was change from baseline in total serum bile acids at the end of the four-week treatment period. Secondary efficacy endpoints included change from baseline on various patient or caretaker-reported assessments of change in itching, including VAS-itch, the partial PO-SCORAD scale and the Whitington itching score, and evaluation of liver biochemistry. The PO-SCORAD is a 10‑point scale that assesses itching and sleep disturbance. The Whitington itching score assesses the severity of itching based on specified alternative descriptions of effect on the skin. For each of the efficacy endpoints, “baseline” referred to the most recent assessment of the applicable measure taken prior to the beginning of the four-week treatment period, which varied among endpoints. The primary safety endpoint of the trial was the incidence of treatment-emergent SAEs during the treatment period.
 The data from the trial showed a reduction in serum bile acids in a substantial majority of patients. The mean reduction in serum bile acids among dose groups ranged from 31% +/- 23% (standard error of the mean, or SEM) to 63% +/- SEM 12%, with some patients experiencing reductions in excess of 90%. The subpopulation of PFIC patients (n = 10, including three patients who participated in two different dose groups) in the trial had a greater mean reduction in serum bile acids than patients in the trial with other cholestatic liver diseases. Overall, the reductions in serum bile acids exhibited high variability which is due to the wide range of doses and to the various diseases and disorders represented and variability in baseline serum bile acid levels within and across dose groups in the trial.
 The data from the trial also showed improvement in pruritus across multiple assessment scales for most patients, with a significant correlation between reduction in serum bile acids and reduction in pruritus. The various liver biochemistry measures assessed in the trial showed high patient variability. There were some increased liver transaminases, which were assessed as mild, transient and either unrelated to odevixibat or with an unclear relationship. In the trial’s fifth dose group (0.2 mg/kg odevixibat dosing), a patient with ALGS whose ALT and aspartate aminotransferase, or AST, had begun increasing prior to enrollment in the trial showed elevated transaminases during the trial that had not come down at the trial’s follow-up visit two weeks following completion of dosing. These elevations were not accompanied by any increase in bilirubin levels, and there are reports in the medical literature of ALGS patients having increased ALT and AST levels after undergoing PEBD surgery, which, like odevixibat, is designed to reduce bile acids in the liver. After review and analysis, the independent DSMB approved continued dosing in the sixth and final cohort in the trial at an odevixibat dose not to exceed 0.2 mg/kg.
 There were no patient dropouts in the trial, and odevixibat exhibited a favorable overall tolerability profile. In particular, all patients completed the trial and there was only one incidence of diarrhea, which occurred prior to the four-week treatment period and was characterized by the applicable clinical investigator as mild. There were two treatment-

 
  13
 
emergent SAEs reported in the trial, both of which were determined by the applicable clinical investigator to be not related to odevixibat.
 Phase 3 Clinical Program in Patients with PFIC
 Our Phase 3 clinical trial of odevixibat, given once per day as an oral capsule or sprinkled over food, in patients with PFIC is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study, which has enrolled 62 patients with PFIC (type 1 or 2). Patients were assigned to receive either 40 µg/kg/day or 120 µg/kg/day of odevixibat, or placebo, for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint for FDA evaluation, and a key secondary endpoint for EMA evaluation, will be an assessment of change in pruritus using a caregiver-reported outcome instrument that we have developed taking into account input from PFIC patients and their caregivers. The primary endpoint for EMA evaluation, and a key secondary endpoint for FDA evaluation, will be serum bile acid responder rate where a responder is a patient who achieves either a reduction in serum bile acid levels of 70% or more from baseline or a serum bile acid level ≤ 70 µmol/l.  In the first quarter 2019, we revised our statistical analysis methodology for PEDFIC 1, in line with guidance from the FDA. One result of the revision is an improvement in the power of the study. The trial provides over 80% power to detect a positive outcome on both the change in pruritus endpoint and the serum bile acid responder rate endpoint, with a positive outcome currently defined as superiority for the combined treated group (both doses) compared to the placebo dose group at a significance level of p ≤ 0.05. The trial will also have several additional secondary endpoints. Patients in the double-blind trial have the opportunity to participate in PEDFIC 2, the open label extension study to assess long-term safety and durability of response and we now have patients on odevixibat for well over a year. We are enrolling patients in an additional ‘expanded’ cohort for PFIC patients who were not eligible for PEDFIC 1.We initiated the double-blind Phase 3 trial in May 2018 and expect data from the trial to be available mid - 2020. 
 Elobixibat
 Our product candidate elobixibat is licensed for the treatment of chronic constipation and other functional diseases in Japan and other select markets in Asia to EA Pharma. In January 2018, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, approved a new drug application filed by EA Pharma for elobixibat for the treatment of chronic constipation in Japan. EA Pharma co-markets elobixibat in Japan with another company, Mochida, and co-promotes elobixibat with Eisai in Japan under the trade name GOOFICE®.
 We have commercial rights to elobixibat in the United States, Europe and all other territories not licensed to EA Pharma. We do not have any current plan to seek a license or other partnering transaction with a third party for elobixibat for chronic constipation in the United States and Europe. Whether or not we elect to seek such a transaction, we do not anticipate that we will conduct future clinical trials of elobixibat as a treatment for chronic constipation independently.
 Elobixibat is, like odevixibat, an IBAT inhibitor. Based on findings on parameters relevant to NASH in clinical trials of elobixibat that we previously conducted in patients with chronic constipation or elevated cholesterol and findings on other parameters relevant to NASH from nonclinical studies that we previously conducted with elobixibat or odevixibat (see “— Preclinical Program in NASH,” below), we believe elobixibat has potential benefit in the treatment of NASH. We have a method of use patent pending in various jurisdictions with respect to the use of elobixibat to treat NASH.  We initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of elobixibat in NAFLD and NASH with the first patients enrolled in June of 2019. We expect to have topline results from the Phase 2 trial in mid-2020. We also expect topline results from another Phase 2 trial in NASH, being conducted in Japan and sponsored by our partner EA Pharma, at the end of 2020 or early 2021.
     Chronic (Idiopathic) Constipation
 Though occasional constipation is very common, some people experience chronic constipation that can interfere with their ability to go about their daily tasks. Pursuant to applicable Rome III diagnostic criteria, two or more of the following symptoms must be present: straining during at least 25% of defecations, lumpy or hard stools in at least 25% of defecations, sensation of incomplete evacuation for at least 25% of defecations, sensation of rectal obstruction or 

 
  14
 
blockage for at least 25% of defecations, use of fingers or other manual maneuvers to facilitate at least 25% of defecations, and passing fewer than three stools per week. In order to support a diagnosis of constipation, the patient must rarely have loose stools without the use of laxatives. Further, in order for constipation to be considered chronic, these criteria must be present for at least three months, with symptom onset at least six months prior to diagnosis. The Rome III diagnostic criteria are established diagnostic measures for various GI disorders set forth by the Rome Foundation, a not-for-profit organization based in the United States. The term “idiopathic” indicates that the cause of the chronic constipation is unknown and not due to any underlying illness or medication.
 The current standard of care for constipation is over-the-counter, or OTC, laxatives, which may improve symptoms of constipation but often exacerbate pain and bloating. Marketed products in Japan that may be prescribed for chronic constipation include Amitiza (lubiprostone) and Linzess (linaclotide), although linaclotide is approved in Japan for the treatment of IBS-C.
 Preclinical and Early Clinical Development of Elobixibat
 Prior to Albireo Limited’s inception in 2008, elobixibat was evaluated by its predecessor owner, AstraZeneca, in various preclinical studies and Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical trials. In Phase 1 clinical development, elobixibat was generally well tolerated in healthy volunteers and showed minimal systemic exposure. Subsequently, we conducted a two-year nonclinical carcinogenicity toxicology study that did not result in any findings of concern and we or our former licensee conducted various additional Phase 1 and early Phase 2 clinical trials to assess the pharmacokinetics and various effects of elobixibat. Findings from these studies indicated, among other things, favorable effects of elobixibat on colonic transit and on low-density lipoprotein, or LDL or “bad” cholesterol. Completed Phase 2b Clinical Trial in the United States
 We completed a multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of elobixibat as a treatment for chronic idiopathic constipation, or CIC, in 2010. We conducted the trial at 45 sites in the United States. Enrollment criteria included a diagnosis of CIC and meeting specified thresholds for numbers of complete spontaneous bowel movements, or CSBMs, per week during the two weeks prior to randomization. A spontaneous bowel movement, or SBM, was defined in the trial as a bowel movement occurring without a laxative, enema or suppository usage in the past 24 hours. A CSBM was defined in the trial as an SBM accompanied by a self-report of complete evacuation.
 After a screening period during which patients were taken off laxatives and other excluded medications, patients in the trial entered a two-week baseline period. Following the baseline period, 190 patients were randomized to receive a once daily oral tablet dose of one of three doses of elobixibat (5, 10 or 15 mg), or placebo, for eight weeks. Of the randomized patients, 161 patients completed the trial.
 The primary endpoint of the trial was change in number of weekly SBMs from baseline to the first treatment week for patients who received elobixibat compared with patients who received a placebo. The results demonstrated a dose response in favor of elobixibat among all three dose groups and were statistically significant in the 10 mg (p < 0.002) and 15 mg (p < 0.001) dose groups. A clinical trial result is statistically significant if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance. The statistical significance of a clinical trial result, such as an observed difference between two treatment groups or cohorts, is determined by a widely used statistical method that establishes the “p”-value of the result. A p-value of 0.05 (or less) indicates that there is a 1‑in‑20 (or less) statistical probability that the clinical trial result occurred by chance and typically represents statistical significance. If a p-value is above 0.05, the result is generally not considered statistically significant. The p-value of < 0.002 for the 10 mg elobixibat dose group indicates that there is a less than 1‑in‑500 statistical probability that the difference compared with placebo occurred by chance, and the p-value of < 0.001 for the 15 mg elobixibat dose group indicates that there is a less than 1‑in‑1,000 statistical probability that the difference compared with placebo occurred by chance.
 Secondary efficacy endpoints of the trial included evaluations of changes in mean weekly number of SBMs and CSBMs, time to first SBM or CSBM, overall constipation response and reduction in C4 and LDL cholesterol levels. The 10 mg and 15 mg elobixibat doses met all of these secondary endpoints with statistical significance.

 All doses of elobixibat were generally well tolerated in the clinical trial. The most frequently reported adverse events in the trial were abdominal pain and diarrhea, which occurred most often in the highest elobixibat dose group (abdominal pain: 10.4%, 5 mg elobixibat; 10.6%, 10 mg elobixibat; and 27.1%, 15 mg elobixibat; versus 0% placebo; and diarrhea: 8.3%, 5 mg elobixibat; 6.4%, 10 mg elobixibat; and 12.5%, 15 mg elobixibat; versus 2.2% placebo). None of the three SAEs reported in the trial (bleeding colonic diverticulum two weeks after the end of treatment in the 5 mg elobixibat dose group, breast carcinoma in the 10 mg elobixibat dose group, and shoulder pain in the placebo group) was considered by the applicable investigator to be related to study drug.
 Completed Phase 2b Clinical Trial Conducted by EA Pharma in Japan
 Our licensee, EA Pharma, completed a multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of elobixibat as a treatment for chronic constipation in 2015. Patients in the trial entered the two-week baseline period during which they were taken off excluded medications. Following the baseline period, patients were randomized to receive a once daily oral dose of either a low, mid or high dose of elobixibat for two weeks. During the baseline period and the treatment period, patients reported daily bowel and abdominal symptoms. Of the randomized patients, 154 patients completed the trial.
 The primary endpoint of the trial was change in number of weekly SBMs from baseline to the first treatment week for patients who received elobixibat compared with patients who received a placebo. In the trial, both the mid and high dose groups of elobixibat showed a highly statistically significant advantage on change from baseline in weekly SBM frequency compared with placebo (p < 0.001). The findings in favor of elobixibat were substantially the same on a secondary endpoint of the trial assessing change from baseline in weekly CSBM frequency.
 All doses of elobixibat were generally well tolerated in the trial, and no SAEs were reported. As in our completed Phase 2b clinical trial, the most frequently reported adverse events in the trial were abdominal pain and diarrhea, which were both assessed by EA Pharma to be typically mild.
 Completed Phase 3 Clinical Trial and Long-Term Safety Trial Conducted by EA Pharma in Japan
 In October 2016, we announced positive results from a Phase 3 clinical trial of elobixibat as a treatment for chronic constipation conducted by EA Pharma in Japan. The trial was a multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled trial in which patients with chronic constipation received a fixed dose of elobixibat or placebo once daily for two weeks. In the trial, elobixibat met the primary endpoint, which was change in the number of weekly SBMs from baseline to the first treatment week compared with placebo, with high statistical significance. Elobixibat also met all secondary efficacy endpoints in the trial assessed statistically, including assessments of change in frequency of CSBMs, time to first SBM, severity of constipation and stool consistency, with high statistical significance.
 There were no SAEs reported in the trial. Consistent with prior clinical trials of elobixibat, the most common adverse events were abdominal pain (18.8%) and diarrhea (13.0%), all of which were characterized as mild or, in one case, moderate in severity.
 EA Pharma also completed a clinical trial designed to evaluate the long-term safety of elobixibat in Japanese patients with chronic constipation over 52 weeks. The long-term safety trial was a multicenter, open label trial in which patients with chronic constipation received once daily dosing of elobixibat. In the trial, elobixibat showed a safety and tolerability profile consistent overall with prior clinical trials of elobixibat in Japan.
 Phase 3 Clinical Trials Conducted by a Former Licensee
 Two Phase 3 clinical trials conducted by a former licensee of ours to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elobixibat as a treatment for CIC, known as Echo 1 and Echo 2, ended in 2014. Our former licensee stopped Echo 1 and Echo 2 early citing an issue related to the distribution of study drug to study sites that was unrelated to the performance of elobixibat. Subsequent analysis by our former licensee determined the issue to have affected only Echo 2 and a small number of patients. As a result of the early termination of the trials, each of Echo 1 and Echo 2 enrolled substantially 

 
  16
 
fewer than the number of patients contemplated by the trial’s statistical plan. A third Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by our former licensee to evaluate the long-term safety of elobixibat, known as Echo 3, ended in 2015.
 Echo 1. Echo 1 was a multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of elobixibat as a treatment for CIC conducted at 71 sites in the United States, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom, Poland and South Africa. SBM and CSBM were defined in the trial in the same manner as our completed Phase 2b trial of elobixibat in CIC discussed above. The statistical plan for the trial contemplated that 840 patients would be enrolled.
 After a screening period, patients in the trial entered a two-week baseline period. Following the baseline period, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a once daily oral dose of 5 mg of elobixibat, 10 mg of elobixibat or placebo, in tablet form, for 26 weeks. During the baseline period and the treatment period, patients reported daily bowel and abdominal symptoms. At the time the trial was stopped, 376 patients had been randomized into the trial, of which 312 patients had completed 12 weeks of treatment and 146 patients had completed 26 weeks of treatment.
 The primary endpoint of the trial was the overall CSBM response. CSBM response refers to a patient having at least three CSBMs per week and an increase of at least one CSBM per week from baseline, in each case for at least nine of the first 12 weeks of the treatment period and at least three of the weeks from week 9 to week 12. The 5 mg elobixibat dose met the primary endpoint, and the result was statistically significant based on the study’s predefined statistical methodology (p = 0.029). There was a trend in favor of the 10 mg elobixibat dose on the primary endpoint, but the result did not achieve statistical significance using the same methodology. Subsequently, at a meeting with the FDA held in 2014, the FDA advised us that, based on the unplanned stopping of the study, the FDA would apply a different statistical methodology than had been predefined and utilized for the study. Using the FDA’s chosen statistical methodology, neither the 5 mg nor the 10 mg dose of elobixibat achieved statistical significance on the primary endpoint in Echo 1.
 All doses of elobixibat were generally well tolerated in the trial. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was dose related (7%, 5 mg elobixibat and 9%, 10 mg elobixibat, versus 2% placebo). There were dose-related incidences of treatment-emergent abdominal pain and diarrhea considered a reasonable possibility to be treatment related (abdominal pain: 4%, 5 mg elobixibat and 12%, 10 mg elobixibat, versus 2% placebo; diarrhea: 6%, 5 mg elobixibat and 6%, 10 mg elobixibat, versus 2% placebo). None of the three SAEs reported in the 5 mg elobixibat dose group, two SAEs reported in the 10 mg elobixibat dose group and one SAE reported in the placebo group were considered by the applicable investigator to be related to study drug. The reported SAEs were: in the 5 mg elobixibat dose group, inflammation of the gallbladder, developmental bone growth disease and carpal tunnel syndrome; in the 10 mg elobixibat dose group, glaucoma and back pain worsening; and in the placebo group, hemorrhoids.
 Echo 2. Echo 2 was a multicenter, double blind, placebo controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of elobixibat as a treatment for CIC. The trial was conducted at 79 sites in the United States, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Enrollment criteria, primary and key secondary endpoints and trial design were substantially the same as for Echo 1, except that Echo 2 from the outset provided for a 12‑week treatment period and included a four-week post-treatment withdrawal period. The statistical plan for the trial contemplated that 840 patients would be enrolled.
 Following the screening and baseline periods, patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a once daily oral dose of 5 mg of elobixibat, 10 mg of elobixibat or placebo, in tablet form. During the baseline period and the treatment period, patients reported daily bowel and abdominal symptoms. At the time the trial was stopped, 314 patients had been randomized into the trial, of which 219 patients completed the trial including the withdrawal period.
 In the trial, there were trends in favor of both the 5 mg and 10 mg elobixibat doses compared with placebo on the primary endpoint, but the result did not reach statistical significance. There were no signs of rebound during the four-week withdrawal period after the treatment period.
 All doses of elobixibat were generally well tolerated in the trial. The rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was the same in the 5 mg elobixibat and placebo dose groups (2%) and greater in the 10 mg elobixibat dose group (6%). 

 
  17
 
There were dose-related incidences of abdominal pain and diarrhea considered a reasonable possibility to be treatment related (abdominal pain: 2%, 5 mg elobixibat and 8%, 10 mg elobixibat, versus 2% placebo; diarrhea (7%, 5 mg elobixibat and 9%, 10 mg elobixibat, versus <1% placebo). There was one SAE reported in the 5 mg elobixibat dose group compared with five SAEs in the placebo group. The reported SAE in the 5 mg elobixibat dose group (basal cell carcinoma on the lip) occurred during the withdrawal period and was not considered by the applicable investigator to be related to study drug. The SAEs reported in the placebo group were tonsillitis, abnormal uterine bleeding, noncancerous uterine tumor, hysterectomy and exacerbation of hypertension.
 Long-Term Safety. The long-term safety trial was a multicenter, open label, Phase 3 extension clinical trial of elobixibat as a treatment for CIC. The trial was conducted at 62 sites in the United States, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Enrollment criteria included completion of at least 12 weeks of double blind treatment in either Echo 1 or Echo 2. The trial enrolled 411 patients. Patients received a 10 mg dose of elobixibat in tablet form once daily, subject to reduction to 5 mg in the discretion of the applicable investigator, for up to 52 weeks. Of these patients, 282 patients completed 52 weeks of treatment with elobixibat and 316 patients completed at least 24 weeks of treatment with elobixibat.
 There were several co-primary endpoints in the trial, all related to safety. In the trial, elobixibat was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to Echo 1 and Echo 2. In particular, there was only one treatment-emergent SAE reported (constipation) that was considered by the applicable investigator to be related to study drug. Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in 6.1% of patients, and the majority of treatment-emergent adverse events overall were classified as mild or moderate. Most adverse events were classified as GI.
 U.S.  Phase 2 Trial in NAFLD/NASH
 We initiated a double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 trial to assess the safety and efficacy of elobixibat 5 mg in NASH/NAFLD patients over 16 weeks, as measured by liver steatosis and various biomarkers. The trial is designed to enroll 46 patients, and the primary endpoint of the trial is an assessment of the change in LDL-cholesterol, and the secondary endpoints are an assessment in the change in liver fat by imaging, AST and ALT. There are a number of exploratory endpoints as well. The first patients were enrolled in the trial in June 2019, and we expect top line results in mid-2020.
 Japan Phase 2 Trial in NAFLD/NASH
 EA Pharma is sponsoring an investigator-initiated study in Japan.  The study is a Phase 2 double-blind, placebo controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a higher dose of elobixibat,10mg, or the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine, or the combination of cholestyramine and elobixibat 10mg or placebo in 100 NASH/NAFLD patients over 16 weeks, as measured by liver steatosis and various biomarkers. The trial is designed to enroll 46 patients, and the primary endpoint of the trial is an assessment of the change in LDL-cholesterol, and the secondary endpoints are an assessment in the change in liver fat by imaging, AST and ALT. There are a number of exploratory endpoints as well. Topline data is expected by the end of 2020 or early 2021.  
 These two Phase 2 Trials are designed to demonstrate positive trends on the combination of liver markers, cardiovascular risk factors and favorable GI tolerability.  Both trials will inform study designs for the next step in the development of elobixibat in NASH.

 A3384
 A3384, a product candidate for the potential treatment for gastrointestinal diseases or disorders, is a proprietary formulation of cholestyramine that is designed to release cholestyramine directly in the colon. We obtained  formulation-related patents in the U.S. with respect to A3384 in October 2019. We are exploring additional development options for A3384 based on an evaluation of its patent coverage and our overall portfolio. 
 Preclinical Program 
 We have an ongoing preclinical program directed towards discovering and advancing to the clinic a novel compound that modulates bile acid levels to treat adult liver diseases including NASH. We hope to provide more details on the specific mechanism of action and our progress in the future.  NASH is a common, serious and sometimes fatal chronic liver disease that resembles alcoholic liver disease but occurs in people who drink little or no alcohol. Based on multiple epidemiological studies published by third parties in 2014 and 2015, we estimate that NASH affects 2 to 3.5% of adults, representing over 9 million people in the United States and 10 million people in the European Union. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of NASH. Lifestyle changes, including modification of diet and exercise to reduce body weight, as well as treatment of concomitant diabetes and dyslipidemia, are commonly accepted as the standard of care for NASH, but have not conclusively been shown to prevent disease progression.
 Some of the principal characteristics of NASH include high LDL cholesterol levels, resistance to insulin in the body, chronic inflammation in the liver and progressive scarring of tissue, known as fibrosis. We have generated favorable clinical or preclinical data on each of these measures with our IBAT inhibitors, either odevixibat or elobixibat, supporting the potential of bile acid modulators generally, and IBAT inhibitors specifically, to become a new treatment option for NASH.
 In particular, the reduction in the reuptake of bile acids triggered by IBAT inhibition signals to the liver to make more bile acids to ensure the presence of a sufficient supply. The liver makes these bile acids from cholesterol, which has the effect of reducing levels of LDL cholesterol in the plasma. Also, increased bile acids in the colon resulting from IBAT inhibition stimulates the secretion of GLP‑1 (glucagon-like peptide‑1), which regulates insulin release from the pancreas and has been shown to decrease insulin resistance. Data from our clinical trials of elobixibat in patients with CIC or abnormal lipid levels demonstrated both of these effects. In addition, as discussed above under “odevixibat — Development of odevixibat — Preclinical and Phase 1 Clinical Development,” in a preclinical mouse model of cholestatic liver injury, odevixibat significantly inhibited the expression of different proteins known to be associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, in preclinical studies conducted by us or third parties, compounds that inhibit the IBAT have been reported to reduce liver concentrations of certain bile acids and cholesterol believed to play a role in the progression of NASH.
 The results of a nonclinical study of odevixibat conducted in an established model of NASH in mice known as the STAM™ model provide further support for the promise of IBAT inhibition mechanism to treat NASH. In the study, NASH conditions were simulated by injecting the mice with the drug streptozotocin soon after birth and providing a high fat diet beginning at four weeks. Baseline was established at week six, following which three cohorts of mice received 0.5 mg/kg of odevixibat, 10 mg/kg of odevixibat or vehicle only once daily for 21 days. In the study, compared with the vehicle group, the 10 mg/kg odevixibat dose group showed significant improvement (p < 0.05) on the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score, or NAS, near significant improvement on a fibrosis measure (p = 0.06) and numerical improvement on plasma ALT levels and triglycerides. The 0.5 mg/kg odevixibat dose group showed incremental advantages on some of these measures. We believe that NAS results with 10 mg/kg odevixibat are competitive with NAS results previously presented from the same model for obeticholic acid, which is marketed as Ocaliva in combination with UDCA, or as a monotherapy for patients unable to tolerate UDCA, to treat PBC by Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Intercept, and is currently in Phase 3 development as a treatment for NASH.

 License and Royalty Monetization Agreements
 Agreement with EA Pharma
 We entered into a license agreement with EA Pharma (formerly known as Ajinomoto Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.) for the development and commercialization of elobixibat in specified countries in Asia in April 2012. 
 Pursuant to the agreement, we granted EA Pharma an exclusive license under patents and other technology owned or licensed by us to develop and commercialize elobixibat in Japan, Indonesia, Korea, Myanmar, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam for all prophylactic or therapeutic uses of a pharmaceutical product for specified GI diseases and disorders, symptoms of constipation of all causes, or postoperative ileus or for use in colonoscopy cleansing procedures. The agreement also provides that the scope of the license may be expanded to include specified liver diseases, if we or an affiliate or licensee takes specified development actions outside of EA Pharma’s licensed territory with elobixibat in that specified liver disease, or files an application for regulatory approval of elobixibat outside of EA Pharma’s licensed territory for that specified liver disease, or otherwise approves that EA Pharma conduct a clinical trial in that specified liver disease.
 Payment Terms. As of February 15, 2020, we have received $49.9 million in upfront and milestone payments from EA Pharma under the agreement. We are eligible to receive additional amounts of up to $4.8 million if a specified regulatory event is achieved for elobixibat. In addition, subject to the terms of the royalty interest acquisition agreement, or RIAA, with HealthCare Royalty Partners III, L.P., or HCR, described below, we may become eligible under the license agreement to receive up to $27.6 million if specified sales milestones are achieved for elobixibat and we also receive stepped royalties beginning in the high single digits on all future net sales of elobixibat. 
 EA Pharma’s obligation under the license agreement to pay royalties for elobixibat expires on a country-by-country basis on the later of expiration of the patent rights in a country that have a specified scope and that we either licensed to EA Pharma or, subject to a specified term limit, are developed by EA Pharma, alone or together with us, in the course of its activities under the agreement or expiration of regulatory exclusivity for elobixibat in that country. The Japanese patent rights with respect to elobixibat that we licensed to EA Pharma expire between 2026 and 2029. In addition, we have two pending patent applications on specific crystal polymorphs of elobixibat that, if issued in Japan, will expire in 2034 and 2035, respectively. Royalty rates are subject to reduction under the agreement in specified circumstances, including in any country if elobixibat is subject to generic competition that exceeds a specified level, if the bulk price for unformulated elobixibat purchased from us for use in Japan exceeds a specified threshold or if EA Pharma licenses patent rights from any third party under circumstances where it is legally required to do so to commercialize elobixibat in its licensed field in a particular country in its licensed territory.
 Development and Commercialization. EA Pharma is responsible for funding and using commercially reasonable efforts to execute the development and commercialization of elobixibat in its licensed field and licensed territory pursuant to agreed territory development and commercialization plans that are updated from time to time. In Japan, EA Pharma co-markets elobixibat with Mochida pursuant to a sublicense agreement and co-promotes elobixibat with Eisai. A joint development committee and a joint commercialization committee, each comprising representatives of each company, oversees activities under the agreement.
 EA Pharma is responsible for commercial manufacture and supply of elobixibat in its licensed territory.
 Restrictions. EA Pharma is not permitted to conduct clinical development or commercialize elobixibat outside of its licensed field of use or licensed territory. We are not permitted to commercialize elobixibat for any field of use in EA Pharma’s licensed territory. In addition, if we determine to develop elobixibat in a liver disease outside of EA Pharma’s licensed territory, our development is subject to specified restrictions on clinical trial design. After the first commercial sale of elobixibat in any country in EA Pharma’s licensed field, neither we nor EA Pharma may commercialize a different product for the treatment of chronic constipation or IBS-C in that country, subject to specified exceptions.

 
  20
 

 Term and Termination. Either we or EA Pharma can terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis if the other party materially breaches the agreement and the breach is not cured within a specified period. Also, either we or EA Pharma can terminate the agreement in its entirety if a specified bankruptcy-related event with regard to the other party occurs. EA Pharma also has the right to terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country basis (except for Japan) for any reason upon 180 days’ notice. The rights and obligations of the parties that survive termination of the agreement vary depending on the basis for the termination.
 Royalty Monetization Agreement with HCR
 In December 2017, we entered into a royalty interest acquisition agreement (RIAA) with HealthCare Royalty Partners III, L.P. (HCR) pursuant to which we sold to HCR our right to receive all royalties from sales of elobixibat in Japan and sales milestones for elobixibat achieved from any covered territory potentially payable to us under the Agreement, up to a specified maximum “cap” amount of $78.8 million, based on the funds we received from HCR to date. We received $44.5 million from HCR, net of certain transaction expenses, under the RIAA and we are eligible to receive an additional $15.0 million under the RIAA if a specified sales milestone is achieved for elobixibat in Japan. If the cap amount is reached, we will again become eligible to receive royalties from Japanese sales and sales milestones from covered territories for elobixibat from EA Pharma under the Agreement. We are obligated to make royalty interest payments to HCR under the RIAA only to the extent it receives future Japanese royalties, sales milestones or other specified payments from EA Pharma. Although we sold our right to receive royalties from the sales of elobixibat in Japan, as a result of its ongoing involvement in the cash flows related to these royalties, we will continue to account for these royalties as revenue. We recorded the $44.5 million as a liability related to sale of future royalties (royalty obligation). The royalty obligation will be accreted using the effective interest rate method, based on our best estimate of the time it will take to reach the capped amount.
 The RIAA requires us to take certain actions with respect to the elobixibat royalties and sales milestones and with respect to our license agreement with EA Pharma and contains certain representations and warranties, covenants, indemnification obligations and other provisions that are customary for a royalty monetization transaction. In addition, for protective purposes only, we (specifically, Albireo Pharma, Inc., Albireo AB and Elobix AB) have agreed to grant HCR a precautionary security interest in specified assets related to elobixibat, but only in the event that, notwithstanding the parties’ intentions, the transfer contemplated by the RIAA is held by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be a true sale.
 We record estimated royalties due for the current period in accrued other expenses until the payment is received from EA Pharma at which time we then remit payment to HCR. As royalties are remitted to HCR, the balance of the royalty obligation will be effectively repaid over the life of the RIAA. In order to determine the accretion of the royalty obligation, we are required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received and submitted to HCR, as noted above, based on our best estimate of the time it will take to reach the cap amount and when milestones will be received. The sum of these amounts less the $44.5 million proceeds we received will be recorded as interest expense over the life of the royalty obligation. At December 31, 2019, our estimate of our total interest expense resulted in a quarterly effective interest rate of approximately 4.13%.
 Terminated License Agreement with Ferring International Center S.A.
 We entered into a license agreement with Ferring International Center S.A., or Ferring, for the development and commercialization of elobixibat outside of the territories licensed to EA Pharma in July 2012, following completion of our Phase 2b clinical trial of elobixibat to treat CIC. Pursuant to the agreement, Ferring commenced a Phase 3 clinical program of elobixibat to treat CIC. In May 2014, Ferring stopped two Phase 3 clinical trials of elobixibat that Ferring had been conducting due to an issue related to the distribution of study drug to study sites that was unrelated to the performance of elobixibat. Subsequently, in March 2015, Ferring terminated the agreement, effective in September 2015. As a result of the termination of the agreement, all licenses that we granted to Ferring under the license agreement terminated and commercial rights to elobixibat in Ferring’s licensed territory reverted to us. In addition, Ferring was required, among other things, to assign to us all rights to all regulatory submissions and approvals controlled by Ferring pertaining to elobixibat in the licensed territory and to grant to us an exclusive right of reference to data, and 

 
  21
 
specified licenses to data and technology, related to elobixibat for the development and commercialization of elobixibat in its licensed field. Notwithstanding the termination of the license agreement, Ferring may be entitled to low single-digit royalty payments on net sales of elobixibat on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis in specified circumstances. 
     Patents and Proprietary Rights
 We actively seek to protect the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including compositions and forms and their methods of use in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets. We also rely upon trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information.
 As of March 1, 2020, our patent estate included 19 issued patents and 24 pending patent applications in the United States and approximately 390 counterpart patents and patent applications in other jurisdictions, including eight European regional issued patents and eight Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications which allow us to seek corresponding patent protection worldwide. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in a particular jurisdiction.

 
  22
 

 We consider the following United States, European (EP) and, in the case of elobixibat, Japanese (JP) patents to be particularly important to the protection of our clinical-stage product candidates.

Product Candidate | Summary Description | Expiration Date 
odevixibat | Composition of matter of odevixibat | September 2022 
 | Method of using certain IBAT inhibitor(s) to treat certain liver diseases | November 2031 
 | Method of using certain IBAT inhibitor(s) in combination with a bile acid binder to treat certain liver diseases | November 2031 (EP pending in US) 
 | Crystal modifications of odevixibat | June 2039 ( pending in US) 
 | Formulations of odevixibat | June 2039 (PCT pending in US) 
Elobixibat | Composition of matter of elobixibat | December 2021 (EP, JP); August 2022 (US) 
 | Method of using an IBAT inhibitor to treat Chronic Idiopathic Constipation or Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation | April 2024 
 | Crystal modifications of elobixibat | April 2034 
 | Crystal modifications of elobixibat | October 2035 (US, pending in EP, JP) 
 | Formulations of elobixibat | 2035 (pending in US and Canada) 
 | Process for manufacturing | 2039 (US, PCT pending) 
 | Method of using certain IBAT inhibitor(s) to treat NASH | November 2031 
A3384 | Cholestyramine pellets | February 2037 
 | Pharmaceutical formulations comprising cholestyramine | February 2037 (US; pending in EP) 
 | Pharmaceutical formulations comprising cholestyramine | August 2038 (pending in US, EP) 
 | Pharmaceutical formulations comprising cholestyramine | August 2039 (pending in US only) 

     
 
  23
 

     We also have issued patents and pending patent applications with equivalent or substantially comparable protection for our product candidates in jurisdictions internationally that we consider key pharmaceutical markets.
 The patent expiration dates referenced above do not reflect any potential patent term extension that we may receive for the United States under The United States Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, or similar patent term extension legislation in Europe and Japan. The Hatch-Waxman Act generally permits a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of FDA approval. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application, or IND, and the submission date of a new drug application, or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and approval date of an NDA. Typically, only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for an extension, and, with limited exceptions, the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.
 In the European Economic Area (EEA; the European Union member countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 generally permits an extension of the patent term for a drug as compensation for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or the national drug agencies. The term of a supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, corresponds to the period between the filing date of the patent and the date of the first Marketing Authorization in the EEA, reduced by a period of 5 years. An SPC may extend the patent term for an approved drug up to five years, but the remaining patent term may not exceed 15 years from the date of the first Marketing Authorization. Only one patent that covers the approved drug is eligible for an SPC. Applications for an SPC are reviewed and approved by the national patent offices of the EEA countries, and must be lodged within six months of the authorization date for the drug in each EEA country (or within six months of the grant of the patent, in case the Marketing Authorization is granted first).
 In Japan, the Japanese Pharmaceutical Affairs Law generally permits the extension of the patent term for a drug as compensation for patent term lost during the regulatory review process by the Japanese PMDA. The patent term extension corresponds to the period from the date of the start of clinical trials or the date of patent registration, whichever is later, until one day prior to the date of approval for the drug. The term of a patent can be extended for up to five years, irrespective of the remaining natural term of the patent as of the date of approval. Each patent that covers the active ingredient in the approved drug, or a method of using the approved drug in the approved indication, is eligible for the extension, which means that, for any particular drug, multiple patents may be extended. The extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within three months from the date of approval. The Japanese Patent Office reviews and approves applications for patent term extension.
 Sales and Marketing
 We currently do not have a commercial organization for the marketing, sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We are building the commercial infrastructure that we believe will be necessary to effectively support the commercialization of odevixibat in the United States and Europe, if odevixibat is approved for PFIC or any other pediatric cholestatic liver disease or disorder. We believe that our commercial organization can be modest in size and targeted to the relatively small number of specialists in the United States and Europe who treat children with orphan cholestatic liver disease.
 The commercial infrastructure for orphan products typically consists of a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. Additional capabilities important to the marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, government accounts and reimbursement support. Based on the number of physicians that treat orphan pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders, we believe that we can effectively target the physician audience for odevixibat in the United States and Europe by establishing a sales force either internally or by contract. To develop the appropriate commercial 

 
  24
 
infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which may be committed prior to any confirmation that odevixibat will be approved.
 Outside of the United States and Europe, we plan to selectively utilize collaborations, distribution or other marketing arrangements with third parties to commercialize odevixibat in any approved indication(s). Likewise, we intend to selectively seek alliances and collaborations to assist us in furthering the development or commercialization of product candidates, such as A3384 and, potentially, elobixibat, targeting large primary care markets that must be served by large sales and marketing organizations.
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of odevixibat, elobixibat, A3384 or any of our other product candidates. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and any products that we may develop.
 We currently engage a single third-party manufacturer to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for odevixibat and elobixibat. We also currently engage single third-party manufacturers to provide fill and finish services for the final drug product formulation of each of odevixibat, elobixibat and A3384 for use in our clinical trials.
 We obtain the supplies of our API and drug products from these manufacturers pursuant to agreements that include specific supply timelines, quality and volume expectations. We obtain the supplies of our product candidates from these manufacturers under master services contracts and specific work orders. However, we do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source for API for any of odevixibat, elobixibat or A3384. If any of our current manufacturers becomes unavailable to us for any reason, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements, although we might incur some delay in identifying and qualifying such replacements.
 Odevixibat and elobixibat are organic compounds of low molecular weight, and are referred to as “small molecules.” A3384 is a specialized formulation of cholestyramine, which is a polymer. A polymer is a chemical compound made up of small molecules arranged in a repeating structure to form a larger molecule. We have selected these compounds based on their potential efficacy and safety, although they are also associated with reasonable cost of goods. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with larger or more established companies.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive 

 
  25
 
than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain marketing approvals for their products more rapidly than we obtain approval for our products. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of making branded products less attractive, from a cost perspective, to buyers.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates are likely to be their efficacy, safety, tolerability, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 We are aware of other companies that are developing product candidates that, like odevixibat and elobixibat, act via IBAT inhibition. Shire plc’s SHP625, also known as maralixibat, and formerly known as LUM001 from Lumena Pharmaceuticals, was studied in Phase 2 clinical trials in PFIC and ALGS. In June 2016, Shire announced that the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for SHP625 for PFIC, type 2. Shire’s SHP626, also known as volixibat, was in Phase 2 development as a treatment for NASH. In November 2018, Shire announced that it licensed exclusive global rights to maralixibat and volixibat to Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Mirum became a public company in July 2019, and has initiated a Phase 3 trial with maralixibat in PFIC, from which it expects top-line results in late 2020. In December 2019, Mirum announced it plans to seek FDA approval for maralixibat for the treatment of pruritis associated with ALGS based on data from Phase 2 trials, with a rolling submission to begin in the third quarter of 2020 and to be completed in the first quarter of 2021. The FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to maralixibat for the treatment of pruritis associated with ALGS in October 2019. GlaxoSmithKline’s linerixibat is at the Phase 2 clinical development stage as a treatment for pruritus in patients with PBC. The FDA granted orphan drug designation to linerixibat for the treatment of PBC in September 2019.
 The competition in our target indications includes the following.
 PFIC and other pediatric cholestatic liver diseases and disorders. For many cholestatic liver diseases and disorders, including in particular PFIC, there are no approved therapies. With regard to the pruritus that is characteristic of these diseases, symptomatic off-label treatment with bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine (marketed as Colestyr, Efensol, Ipocol, Kolestran, Lipocol, Olestyr, Prevalite or Quantalan in various countries), typically provides only modest relief. Bristol Myers Squibb has discontinued manufacture of Questran, but generic versions of the drug are marketed by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, Inc., Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. and Sandoz, the generic pharmaceuticals division of Novartis AG.
 A number of other drugs, including UDCA, a bile acid, rifampin, an antibiotic derivative, and naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, are used off-label for patients suffering from cholestatic liver disease. Additionally, surgical interventions, such as PEBD surgery, and external liver filtering procedures are also employed in an attempt to lower bile acid levels, manage pruritus and improve measures of liver function.
 As noted above, Mirum initiated a Phase 3 trial for maralixibat as a treatment for PFIC in July 2019, from which it expects top-line results in late 2020. Mirum has announced plans to seek FDA approval for maralixibat in the treatment of pruritis associated with ALGS, with a rolling submission to begin in the third quarter of 2020 and to be completed in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, Intercept Pharmaceuticals’ obeticholic acid, or OCA, is approved in the U.S. in combination with UDCA, or as a monotherapy for patients unable to tolerate UDCA, to treat PBC. OCA is also in Phase 2 development at Intercept as a treatment for biliary atresia. In July 2019, Genfit SA received orphan designations from the FDA and EMA for its PPAR alpha/delta agonist, (elafibranor), for the treatment of PBC. Genfit has announced plans to advance elafibranor into a Phase 3 program for PBC in 2020. Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s FXR agonist, cilofexor, is in Phase 2 development for PBC, and Phase 3 development for PSC.
 NASH. There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of NASH. There are several marketed therapeutics that are currently used off-label for the treatment of NASH, such as vitamin E (an antioxidant), insulin sensitizers (e.g., metformin), antihyperlipidemic agents (e.g., gemfibrozil), pentoxifylline and UDCA, but none has been clearly shown in clinical trials to show a significant reversal in liver fibrosis. Product candidates in Phase 3 clinical development in NASH include Intercept’s OCA, Genfit’s elafibranor, and Allergan plc’s dual CCR2 and CCR5 inhibitor (cenicriviroc). 

 
  26
 
In November 2019, the FDA accepted Intercept’s NDA for OCA for the treatment of fibrosis due to NASH, and granted priority review. In December 2019, Intercept announced that it submitted a marketing authorization application to the EMA for OCA for the treatment of fibrosis due to NASH, and that the FDA tentatively scheduled the advisory committee meeting for Intercept’s NDA for April 22, 2020. In March 2019, Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial in NASH with its thyroid hormone receptor selective agonist (resmetirom). In December 2019, Madrigal initiated a second Phase 3 clinical trial with resmetirom in NAFLD and NASH. There are many other product candidates in or believed to be in Phase 2 clinical development in NASH.
 Chronic Constipation. Linaclotide, marketed by Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Allergan as Linzess in the United States and as Constella in Europe, is approved in the United States for the treatment of CIC and IBS-C and in Europe for the treatment of IBS-C. Linaclotide is also approved for the treatment of IBS-C in Japan, where it is marketed by Astellas. Linaclotide targets guanylate cyclase C in the intestines and, by doing so, induces intestinal chloride secretion, which results in the outpouring of water into the intestine. The primary side effect of linaclotide is diarrhea. In addition, lubiprostone, which is marketed in the United States as Amitiza by Takeda Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., is approved in the United States for the treatment of CIC, IBS-C and opioid-induced constipation. Amitiza is also approved for the treatment of CIC in the United Kingdom and Switzerland, and for the treatment of chronic constipation in Japan, where it is marketed by Mylan, N.V. Amitiza binds selectively to and activates the type‑2 chloride channel in the intestine releasing chloride and water into the intestine. The primary side effect of Amitiza is nausea. Prucalopride, marketed by Shire in the United States as Motegrity and in the European Union as Resolor, is a motility agent approved for the treatment of CIC. Motegrity and Resolor are associated with a high rate of headaches, and belong to a class of drugs known as 5‑HT receptor drugs that has been linked to cardiovascular safety issues.
 Numerous OTC products are available for constipation. These include psyllium husk (such as Metamucil), methylcellulose (such as Citrucel), calcium polycarbophil (such as FiberCon), lactulose (such as Cephulac), polyethylene glycol (such as MiraLax), sennosides (such as Exlax), bisacodyl (such as Ducolax), docusate sodium (such as Colace), magnesium hydroxide (such as Milk of Magnesia), saline enemas (such as Fleet) and sorbitol. Given the low barriers to access, many CIC sufferers first try OTC fiber and laxatives, but these options are not sufficiently effective for many people.
 Plecanatide, marketed as Trulance by Bausch Health Companies, Inc., is approved in the United States to treat CIC and IBS-C and is, like linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase-C agonist. On September 12, 2019, the FDA approved Ardelyx, Inc.’s product, IBSRELA (tenapanor), for the treatment of IBS-C. IBSRELA inhibits the sodium transporter NHE3 and reduces sodium uptake from the gut to increase the secretion of water in the intestines.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory requirements, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process,  the approval process or after  approval may subject an applicant or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of  letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, 

 
  27
 
restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA, if applicable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or API and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A 

 
  28
 
protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can be initiated or restarted (in cases when the trial is placed on clinical hold after it has already begun).
 In addition, an IRB representing each institution that is participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to clinical trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials, including details of the protocol and eventually study results, also must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov data registry.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

· | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition, in order to be tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, in order to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in one or more well-controlled clinical trials in order to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the drug, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if SAEs occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other clinical trials or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, = if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the clinical protocol or GCP or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, which requests approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the fee for the submission of an NDA for which clinical data is required exceeds $2.5 million for FY2019, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently exceeding $309,000 per program. These fees are typically increased annually, but exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances (such as a waiver for the first human drug application submitted by a qualifying small business and exemptions for orphan products).

 
  29
 

 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date the NDA is accepted for filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months from the date the NDA is accepted for filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the drug product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS.  REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS are tailored to the specific risk/benefit profile of a drug and can include requirements such as medication guides for patients, detailed communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, restricted distribution, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS as a condition of approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS and the specific components that are involved can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.
 The FDA often refers an application for a new drug to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making final approval decisions about a particular NDA.
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
 Specifically, the FDA may grant a product the fast track designation if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track product application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be 

 
  30
 
withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. In September of 2018, the FDA granted fast track designation to odevixibat for the treatment of pruritus associated with PFIC.
 In 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory program for products designated as “breakthrough therapies.” A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to designated breakthrough therapies, including: holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 Accelerated Approval Pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that generally provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments and based upon a demonstration that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. Depending on the outcome of our double blind, Phase 3 clinical trial of odevixibat in patients with PFIC, we may elect to pursue accelerated approval of odevixibat.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate long-term clinical benefit of a drug.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.

 
  31
 

 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug. All promotional materials for product candidates being considered and approved under the accelerated approval program are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher
 The FDA may grant rare pediatric disease designation for indications in the treatment or prevention of a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States and that is a serious or life-threatening disease that primarily affects individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children and adolescents. In June of 2018, the FDA granted a rare pediatric disease designation to odevixibat for the treatment of PFIC. Under the FDCA, a sponsor who receives approval of an NDA for a product that is for the prevention or treatment of a rare pediatric disease and meets certain additional criteria, may qualify for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, or PRV. A PRV can be redeemed to receive priority review under an expedited timeframe for a subsequent marketing application for a different product. A PRV may also be sold or transferred from the initial sponsor to another sponsor and may be further transferred any number of times before it is used. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, FDA’s authority to award rare pediatric disease PRVs has been extended until 2020 and until 2022 for products that receive rare pediatric disease designation by 2020.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information and for specific indications. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to the CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product; require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling; require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval; require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization; or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured, marketed or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and related establishments, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications.

 
  32
 

 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and others involved in the manufacturing process. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant penalties.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Most recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10‑year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023.
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug 

 
  33
 
is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug . . .”
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of nonpatent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of nonpatent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years after the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30‑Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant submits its application to the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the RLD in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant also is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Specifically, the applicant for a follow-on drug product must certify with respect to each patent that:

· | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


· | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval).
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA owner and patent holders once the ANDA in question has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA owner and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.

 Pediatric Clinical Trials and Exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric trial plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric trial or trials the applicant plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of nonpatent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the nonpatent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to odevixibat for the treatment of PFIC, ALGS, biliary atresia and PBC. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the designation request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 The term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug, biological product or approved medical device may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided that certain statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. For drugs, the Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the 

 
  35
 
expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension, and only those claims reading on the approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug, provided that statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
 Regulation Outside the United States
 In order to market any product candidate outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product candidate, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of a product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Regulation and Marketing Authorization in the European Union
 Clinical Trial Approval
 Requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the European Union including Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, are implemented in the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the GCP Directive 2005/28/EC. Pursuant to Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of an E.U. member state in which a trial is planned to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. To this end, a CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier, or IMPD, and further supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country.
 In April 2014, the European Commission passed the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the European Union, the new E.U. clinical trials legislation was enacted as a regulation that is directly applicable in all E.U. member states. All clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC until the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 becomes applicable.
 The new Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trial in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include:

· | a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the E.U. portal;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures that will spare sponsors from submitting broadly identical information separately to various bodies and different member states;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  36
 


· | a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I is assessed jointly by all member states concerned and Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial application; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the involvement of the ethics committees in the assessment procedure in accordance with the national law of the member state concerned but within the overall timelines defined by the Regulation (EU) No 536/2014.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  PRIME Designation
 The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, grants access to the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, program to investigational medicines for which it determines there to be preliminary data available showing the potential to address an unmet medical need and bring a major therapeutic advantage to patients. As part of the program, EMA provides early and enhanced dialogue and support to optimize the development of eligible medicines and speed up their evaluation, aiming to bring promising treatments to patients sooner. The EMA has granted access to the PRIME program at the “proof of concept” stage for odevixibat to treat PFIC.
 Marketing Authorization
 Authorization to market a product in the member states of the European Union proceeds under one of four procedures: a centralized authorization procedure, a mutual recognition procedure, a decentralized procedure or a national procedure. Centralized Authorization Procedure
 The centralized procedure enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid in all E.U. member states based on a single application. Certain medicinal products, including products developed by means of biotechnological processes, must undergo the centralized authorization procedure for marketing authorization, which, if granted by the European Commission, is automatically valid in all 28 E.U. member states. The EMA and the European Commission administer this centralized authorization procedure pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
 Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, this procedure is mandatory for various types of products, including, among others, products that are designated as orphan medicinal products pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000.
 The centralized authorization procedure is optional for other medicinal products if they contain a new active substance or if the applicant shows that the medicinal product concerned constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization is in the interest of patients in the European Union.
 Administrative Procedure
 Under the centralized authorization procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, serves as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of medicinal products for human use on behalf of the EMA. The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member state’s national authority for medicinal products, with an expert appointed to act as Rapporteur for the co-ordination of the evaluation with the possible assistance of a further member of the CHMP acting as a Co-Rapporteur. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout its life cycle. The CHMP has 210 days to adopt an opinion as to whether a marketing authorization should be granted. The process usually takes longer in case additional information is requested, which triggers clock-stops in the procedural timelines. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory authorities of member states and a number of experts. When an application is submitted for a marketing authorization in respect of a drug that is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, the applicant may pursuant to Article 14(9) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 request an accelerated assessment procedure. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time-limit of 210 days

will be reduced to 150 days but it is possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time-limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report, or EPAR, is produced. If the opinion is negative, information is given as to the grounds on which this conclusion was reached. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision on the MAA must be adopted by the European Commission, after consulting the E.U. member states, which in total can take more than 60 days.
 Conditional Approval
 In specific circumstances, E.U. legislation (Article 14(7) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables applicants to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. Marketing Authorization under Exceptional Circumstances
 Under Article 14(8) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, products for which the applicant can demonstrate that comprehensive data (in line with the requirements laid down in Annex I of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended) cannot be provided (due to specific reasons foreseen in the legislation) might be eligible for marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances. This type of authorization is reviewed annually to reassess the risk-benefit balance. The fulfillment of any specific procedures/obligations imposed as part of the marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances is aimed at the provision of information on the safe and effective use of the product and will normally not lead to the completion of a full dossier/approval. Market Authorizations Granted by Authorities of E.U. Member States
 In general, if the centralized procedure is not followed, there are three alternative procedures as prescribed in Directive 2001/83/EC:

· | The decentralized procedure allows applicants to file identical applications to several E.U. member states and receive simultaneous national approvals based on the recognition by E.U. member states of an assessment by a reference member state.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The national procedure is only available for products intended to be authorized in a single E.U. member state.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A mutual recognition procedure similar to the decentralized procedure is available when a marketing authorization has already been obtained in at least one E.U. member state.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union.

 Pediatric Studies
 Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are set forth in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which is referred to as the Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population.
 Before a marketing authorization application can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
 In 2017, the PDCO agreed to our PIP for odevixibat as a treatment for PFIC.
 Periods of Authorization and Renewals
 A marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the E.U. market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 The European Commission, following an evaluation by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, has designated odevixibat as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of PFIC, as well as for the treatment of PBC and ALGS. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000, the European Commission can grant such orphan medicinal product designation to products for which the sponsor can establish that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the European Union, or a life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Union and that without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would generate a sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. In addition, the sponsor must establish that there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients.
 Orphan drug designation is not a marketing authorization. It is a designation that provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and the possibility to apply for a centralized E.U. marketing authorization, as well as ten years of market exclusivity following marketing authorization of the designated orphan drug. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA, the European Commission nor the member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a similar medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as those contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product and that is intended for the same therapeutic indication. A “similar active substance” is defined as an active substance that is identical or has the same principal molecular structural features (but not necessarily all of the same molecular features) and acts via the same mechanism as the authorized orphan medicinal product. The 

 
  39
 
market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In addition, a competing similar medicinal product may in limited circumstances be authorized prior to the expiration of the market exclusivity period, including if it is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the already approved orphan drug. Furthermore, a product can lose orphan designation and the related benefits, prior to us having obtained a marketing authorization, if it is demonstrated that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met.
 Regulatory Data Protection
 E.U. legislation also provides for a system of regulatory data and market exclusivity. According to Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities approved on the basis of complete independent data package benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder, or MAH, obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the innovator is able to gain the period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials. However, products designated as orphan medicinal products enjoy, upon receiving marketing authorization, a period of ten years of orphan market exclusivity—see also “Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity.” Depending upon the timing and duration of the E.U. marketing authorization process, products may be eligible for up to five years’ supplementary protection certificates, or SPCs, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 469/2009. Such SPCs extend the rights under the basic patent for the drug. Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
 If we obtain authorization for a medicinal product in the European Union, we will be required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products: Pharmacovigilance and Other Requirements
 We will, for example, have to comply with the E.U.’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. Other requirements relate, for example, to the manufacturing of products and APIs in accordance with good manufacturing practice standards. E.U. regulators may conduct inspections to verify our compliance with applicable requirements, and we will have to continue to expend time, money and effort to remain compliant. Noncompliance with E.U. requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, or requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties in the European Union. Similarly, failure to comply with the E.U.’s requirements regarding the protection of individual personal data can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. Individual E.U. member states may also impose various sanctions and penalties in case we do not comply with locally applicable requirements. Manufacturing
 The manufacturing of authorized drugs, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA’s cGMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the European Union, which mandate the methods, facilities and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity. The EMA enforces its cGMP requirements through mandatory 

 
  40
 
registration of facilities and inspections of those facilities. The EMA may have a coordinating role for these inspections although the responsibility for carrying them out rests with the member states’ competent authority under whose responsibility the manufacturer falls. Failure to comply with these requirements could interrupt supply and result in delays, unanticipated costs and lost revenues, and could subject the applicant to potential legal or regulatory action, including but not limited to warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil and criminal penalties.
 Marketing and Promotion
 The marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs or the general public, are strictly regulated in the European Union under Directive 2001/83/EC. The applicable regulations aim to ensure that information provided by holders of marketing authorizations regarding their products is truthful, balanced and accurately reflects the safety and efficacy claims authorized by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Patent Term Extension
 In order to compensate the patentee for delays in obtaining a marketing authorization for a patented product, an SPC may be granted extending the exclusivity period for that specific product by up to five years. Applications for SPCs must be made to the relevant patent office in each E.U. member state and the granted certificates are valid only in the member state of grant. An application has to be made by the patent owner within six months of the first marketing authorization being granted in the European Union (assuming the patent in question has not expired, lapsed or been revoked) or within six months of the grant of the patent (if the marketing authorization is granted first). In the context of SPCs, the term “product” means the active ingredient or combination of active ingredients for a medicinal product and the term “patent” means a patent protecting such a product or a new manufacturing process or application for it. The duration of an SPC is calculated as the difference between the patent’s filing date and the date of the first marketing authorization, minus five years, subject to a maximum term of five years.
 A six month pediatric extension of an SPC may be obtained where the patentee has carried out an agreed pediatric investigation plan, the authorized product information includes information on the results of the studies and the product is authorized in all member states of the European Union.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 In June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). Following the formation of a majority Conservative government in December 2019, the United Kingdom approved the withdrawal agreement and left the European Union on January 31, 2020. 
 Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from European Union directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Sales of products approved by the FDA will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the 

 
  41
 
payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessment, or HTA) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. E.U. member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various E.U. member states, and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 Healthcare Law and Regulation
 If our product candidates are approved in the United States, we will have to comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws, rules and regulations. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These laws include:
· | the federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  42
 

terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
