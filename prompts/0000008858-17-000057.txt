 Item 1. Business
 Avnet, Inc., founded in 1921 and incorporated in New York in 1955, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Company” or “Avnet”), is a global value-added distributor of electronic components. Avnet creates a vital link in the technology supply chain that connects the world’s leading electronic component manufacturers with a global customer base primarily comprised of original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”) providers and original design manufacturers (“ODMs”). Avnet distributes electronic components, as received from its suppliers or through a customized integrated solution, and offers assembly and other value-added services. 
 Avnet supports customers of all types and sizes at each stage of the product lifecycle with a comprehensive portfolio of design and supply chain services. With deep expertise in design and engineering, broad line distribution, integration and services, Avnet is uniquely positioned to meet critical time-to-market needs for customers globally.
 Organizational Structure
 At the end of fiscal 2017, Avnet had two primary operating groups — Electronic Components (“EC”) and Premier Farnell (“PF”). Both operating groups have operations in each of the three major economic regions of the world: the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia/Pacific, consisting of Asia, Australia and New Zealand (“Asia”). Each operating group has its own management team that includes senior executives and leadership both at the global and regional levels, who manage various functions within such businesses. Each operating group also has distinct financial reporting that is evaluated at the executive level on which operating decisions and strategic planning and resource allocation for the Company as a whole are made. Divisions (“business units”) exist within each operating group that serve primarily as sales and marketing units to further streamline the sales efforts within each operating group and enhance each operating group’s ability to work with its customers and suppliers, generally along more specific product lines or geographies. However, each business unit relies heavily on the support services provided by the operating groups as well as centralized support at the corporate level. 
 A description of each operating group is presented below. Further financial information by operating group is provided in Note 17 “Segment information” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Avnet’s foreign operations are subject to a variety of risks. These risks are discussed further under Risk Factors in Item 1A and under Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in Item 7A of this Report. Additionally, the specific translation impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, most notably the Euro and the British Pound, on the Company’s consolidated financial statements are further discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.

 Acquisitions
 Avnet has historically pursued business acquisitions to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives, completing 100 acquisitions since 1991. This acquisition program was a significant factor in Avnet becoming one of the largest value-added distributors of electronic components including integrated products and solutions. In fiscal 2017, this trend continued with the acquisitions of Premier Farnell, a global distributor of electronic components that utilizes a digital platform to provide innovators and engineers with the latest products, services and development software, and Hackster.io, an online community that helps users learn how to design, create and program internet-connected hardware. Avnet expects to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to expand its market presence, increase its scale and scope, and extend its product and service offerings throughout all stages of the technology product lifecycle.
 See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on acquisitions completed during fiscal 2017.
 Discontinued Operations
 During fiscal 2017, the Company sold the Technology Solutions operating group (the “TS Business”) or “TS”, which was historically a reportable operating segment. With the sale of the TS Business, the Company is focused on providing design and supply chain solutions specific to the electronic components industry.
 See Note 3 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion on the sale of the TS Business.
 Major Products
 One of Avnet’s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products it distributes. Texas Instruments products accounted for approximately 11% of the Company’s consolidated sales from continuing operations during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, and was the only supplier from which sales of its products, software and services exceeded 10% of consolidated sales. Listed in the table below are the major product categories and the Company’s approximate sales of each during the past three fiscal years. Fiscal 2016 contained 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in the other fiscal years presented. 
 | Years Ended | 
 | July 1, | | July 2, | | June 27,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 
 | (Millions) | 
Semiconductors | $ | 13,537.9 | | $ | 13,978.0 | $ | 14,886.3
Interconnect, passive & electromechanical (IP&E) | | 3,397.9 | | | 2,539.9 | | 2,594.7 
Other | | 504.2 | | | 222.7 | | 174.3

  Competition & Markets
 The electronic components industry continues to be extremely competitive. The Company’s major competitors include: Arrow Electronics, Inc., Future Electronics, World Peace Group, Mouser Electronics and Digi-Key Electronics. There are also certain smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower regions, markets, products or particular sectors. In addition, the Company may compete with its own suppliers that maintain a direct salesforce and with contract manufacturers and EMS providers that purchase directly from suppliers. As a result of these factors, Avnet must remain competitive in its pricing of products and services.

 A key competitive factor in the electronic component distribution industry is the need to carry a sufficient amount of inventory to meet customers’ rapid delivery requirements. To minimize its exposure related to inventory on hand, the majority of the Company’s products are purchased pursuant to non-exclusive distributor agreements, which typically provide certain protections for product obsolescence and price erosion. These agreements are generally cancelable upon 30 to 180 days’ notice and, in most cases, provide for or require inventory return privileges upon cancellation. In fiscal 2017, certain suppliers terminated their distribution agreements with the Company, which did not result in any significant inventory write-downs as a result of such terminations. In addition, the Company enhances its competitive position by offering a variety of value-added services, which entail the performance of services and/or customer support tailored to individual customer specifications and business needs, such as point of use replenishment, testing, assembly, supply chain management and materials management.
 A competitive advantage is the breadth of the Company’s supplier product line card. Because of the number of Avnet’s suppliers, many customers can simplify their procurement process and make all of their required purchases from Avnet, rather than purchasing from several different distributors or other vendors.
 Seasonality
 Historically, Avnet’s business and continuing operations has not been materially impacted by seasonality, with the exception of a relatively minor impact on consolidated results from shifts in regional sales trends from Asia in the first half of a fiscal year to the western regions of the Americas and EMEA in the second half of a fiscal year.   Number of Employees
 At July 1, 2017, Avnet had approximately 15,700 employees compared to 17,700 employees at July 2, 2016, and 18,800 at June 27, 2015.
