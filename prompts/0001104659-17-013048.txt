ITEM 1.                                        BUSINESS
 
When this report uses the words the Company, we, us and our, these words refer to Monster Beverage Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. Based in Corona, California, Monster Beverage Corporation is a holding company and conducts no operating business, except through its consolidated subsidiaries. The Companys subsidiaries primarily develop and market energy drinks as well as Mutant® Super Soda drinks.
 
Stock Split
 
On October 14, 2016, we announced a three-for-one stock split of the Companys common stock (the Stock Split), to be effected in the form of a 200% stock dividend. The common stock dividend was issued on November 9, 2016 and the Companys common stock began trading at the split adjusted price on November 10, 2016. Accordingly, all per share amounts, average common stock outstanding, common stock outstanding, common stock repurchased and equity based compensation presented in this Form 10-K have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect the stock split.
Stock Repurchases
 
On April 28, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized us to commence a modified Dutch auction tender offer to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock (the Auction Stock Repurchase Tender). The Auction Stock Repurchase Tender was authorized under our existing share repurchase authority and was funded with cash on hand. We commenced this tender offer in May 2016. On June 15, 2016, we accepted for payment an aggregate of 38.5 million shares of common stock at a purchase price of $52.00 per share, for a total amount of $2.0 billion (excluding commissions), which exhausted the availability under all previously authorized share repurchase plans. Such shares of common stock are included in common stock in treasury in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016.
 
On August 2, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock (the August 2016 Repurchase Plan). During the year ended December 31, 2016, we purchased 5.8 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $43.40 per share, for a total amount of $249.9 million (excluding broker commissions), which exhausted the availability under the August 2016 Repurchase Plan. Such shares of common stock are included in common stock in treasury in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016.
 
On February 28, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $500.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock (the February 2017 Repurchase Plan). No shares have been repurchased pursuant to the February 2017 Repurchase Plan.
 
Acquisitions and Divestitures
 
On April 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of flavor supplier and long-time business partner American Fruits & Flavors (AFF), in an asset acquisition that brought our primary flavor supplier in-house, secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors in perpetuity and further enhanced our flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities (the AFF Transaction). Pursuant to the terms of the AFF Transaction, we purchased AFF for $688.5 million in cash after adjustments. We accounted for the AFF Transaction in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805 Business Combinations. (See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements).

On June 12, 2015, we completed the transactions contemplated by the definitive agreements entered into with The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) on August 14, 2014, which provided for a long-term strategic relationship in the global energy drink category (the TCCC Transaction). (See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements).
 
Reportable Segments
 
We have three operating and reportable segments, (i) Monster Energy® Drinks segment (Monster Energy® Drinks), which is comprised of our Monster Energy® drinks as well as Mutant® Super Soda drinks, (ii) Strategic Brands segment (Strategic Brands), which include the various energy drink brands acquired from TCCC as a result of the TCCC Transaction and (iii) Other segment (Other), the principal products of which include the non-energy brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction, as well as certain products acquired as part of the AFF Transaction that are sold to independent third-parties (the AFF Third-Party Products).  Corporate and unallocated amounts that do not relate to a reportable segment specifically have been allocated to Corporate and Unallocated. Our Monster Energy® Drinks segment represented 90.5%, 92.5% and 93.9% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our Strategic Brands segment represented 8.9% and 5.3% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (effectively from June 13, 2015). Our Other segment represented 0.6%, 2.2% and 6.1% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
Our Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged drinks primarily to bottlers and full service beverage distributors. In some cases, we sell directly to retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, food service customers and the military.
 
Our Strategic Brands segment primarily generates net operating revenues by selling concentrates and/or beverage bases to authorized bottling and canning operations. Such bottlers generally combine the concentrates and/or beverage bases with sweeteners, water and other ingredients to produce ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks. The ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks are then sold to other bottlers, full service distributors, wholesalers, or retailers directly, including, retail grocery and specialty chains, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, food service customers, drug stores and the military. To a lesser extent, our Strategic Brands segment generates net operating revenues by selling ready-to-drink packaged energy drinks to bottlers and full service beverage distributors.
 
Generally, the Monster Energy® Drinks segment generates higher per case net operating revenues, but lower per case gross profit margins, than the Strategic Brands segment.

Corporate History
 
In the 1930s, Hubert Hansen and his sons started a business selling fresh non-pasteurized juices in Los Angeles, California. This business eventually became Hansens Juices, Inc., which subsequently became known as The Fresh Juice Company of California, Inc. (FJC).  FJC retained the right to market and sell fresh non-pasteurized juices under the Hansens® trademark. In 1977, Tim Hansen, one of the grandsons of Hubert Hansen, perceived a demand for shelf stable pasteurized natural juices and juice blends and formed Hansen Foods, Inc. (HFI). HFI expanded its product line from juices to include Hansens Natural Soda® brand sodas. In 1990, California Co-Packers Corporation (d/b/a Hansen Beverage Company) (CCC) acquired certain assets of HFI, including the right to market the Hansens® brand name. In 1992, Hansen Natural Corporation acquired the Hansens® brand natural soda and apple juice business from CCC. Under our ownership, the Hansens® beverage business significantly expanded to include a wide range of beverages within the growing alternative beverage category including, in particular, energy drinks. In 1999, we acquired all of FJCs rights to manufacture, sell and distribute fresh non-pasteurized juice products under the Hansens® trademark together with certain additional rights. In 2012, we changed our name from Hansen Natural Corporation to Monster Beverage Corporation. In 2015, as part of the TCCC Transaction, we acquired the Strategic Brands from TCCC and disposed of our non-energy drink business.
2016 Product Introductions
 
During 2016, we continued to expand our existing portfolio of drinks and further develop our distribution markets. During 2016, we introduced the following products:

In the normal course of business we discontinue certain products and/or product lines. Those products or product lines discontinued in 2016, either individually or in aggregate, did not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Other Products
 
We continue to evaluate and, where considered appropriate, introduce additional flavors and types of beverages to complement our existing product lines. We may also evaluate, and where considered appropriate, introduce additional types of consumer products we consider are complementary to our existing products and/or to which our brand names are able to add value. Under the terms of the TCCC Transaction, we have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to compete with TCCC in non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages, other than the energy drink category.
Products  Packaging
 
Our products are packaged in a variety of different package types and sizes including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum Cap Cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends and, to a limited extent, glass bottles. In addition to these packages, our bottlers package Mutant® Super Soda drinks and certain of our Strategic Brands in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles.
Manufacture and Distribution
 
We do not directly manufacture finished goods, but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third-party bottlers and contract packers.
 
The AFF Transaction brought our primary flavor supplier in-house, secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors in perpetuity and further enhanced our flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities for our Monster Energy® Drinks segment. We also source flavors from other suppliers. We purchase flavors, concentrates, sweeteners, juices, dietary ingredients, cans, bottles, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our beverage products from our suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases, certain common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the product, the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including dietary ingredients) for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage, the bottler/packer may also add carbonation to the products as part of the production process.
 
8



For our Strategic Brands segment, we primarily purchase concentrates and/or beverage bases which are then sold to certain of our various third-party bottlers/distributors. The third-party bottlers/distributors are responsible for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products, including the procurement of all other required ingredients and packaging materials. For certain limited products, we may purchase flavors, concentrates, sweeteners, juices, flavors, dietary ingredients, cans, bottles, caps, labels, trays, boxes and other ingredients for our Strategic Brand products from our suppliers, which are delivered to our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. In some cases, certain common supplies may be purchased by our various third-party bottlers and co-packers. Depending on the product, the third-party bottlers or co-packers add filtered water and/or other ingredients (including dietary ingredients), for the manufacture and packaging of the finished products into our approved containers in accordance with our recipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage, the bottler/co-packer may also add carbonation to the products as part of the production process.
 
Co-Packing Arrangements
 
All of our finished goods are manufactured by various third-party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. The majority of our co-packaging arrangements are generally on a month-to-month basis or are terminable upon request and do not generally obligate us to produce any minimum quantities of products within specified periods.
 
In some instances subject to agreement, certain equipment may be purchased by us and installed at the facilities of our co-packers to enable them to produce certain of our products. In many cases, such equipment remains our property and is returned to us upon termination of the packing arrangements with such co-packers, unless we are reimbursed by the co-packer at the then book value or via a per-case credit over a pre-determined number of cases that are produced at the facilities concerned.
 
For our Monster Energy® Drinks segment, we are generally responsible for arranging for the purchase and delivery to our third-party bottlers and co-packers of the containers in which our beverage products are packaged.
 
Our products are packaged in a number of locations, both domestically and internationally, to enable us to produce products closer to the markets where they are sold with the objective of reducing freight costs as well as transportation-related product damages. As distribution volumes increase in both our domestic and international markets, we will continue to source additional packing arrangements closer to such markets to further reduce freight costs. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, particularly in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products and/or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials including, but not limited to, aluminum cans, aluminum Cap Cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, PET plastic bottles, glass, labels, flavors, juice concentrates, dietary ingredients, other ingredients and certain sweeteners, and/or procure adequate packing arrangements and/or obtain adequate or timely shipment of our products, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. In this regard, due to a shortage in available retort capacity, we were unable to fulfill demand in full for our Java Monster and Muscle Monster products during the latter half of 2016. (See Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors).
 
Our production arrangements are generally of short duration or are terminable upon request. For certain of our products, including our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, our Java Monster® product line, our Muscle Monster® product line, our Punch Monster® product line and certain of our other products, there are limited co-packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate
 
9



capacity and/or suitable equipment to package our products. We believe a short disruption or delay in production would not significantly affect our revenues; however, as alternative co-packing facilities in our domestic and international markets with adequate long-term capacity may not be available for such products, either at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period, if at all, a lengthy disruption or delay in production of any of such products could significantly affect our revenues.
 
We continue to actively seek alternative and/or additional co-packing facilities around the world (including in Africa, Asia, Australia, Central and South America, China, Europe, India, Mexico, the Middle East and the United States) with adequate capacity and capability for the production of our various products to minimize transportation costs and transportation-related damages as well as to mitigate the risk of a disruption in production and/or importation.
 
Distribution Agreements
 
During 2016, we continued to expand distribution of our products in both our domestic and international markets, due in part to the TCCC Transaction.
 
Monster Energy® Distribution Agreements
 
We have entered into agreements with various distributors providing for the distribution of our products during initial terms of up to twenty years, which may be renewed thereafter for additional terms ranging from one to five years.  Such agreements remain in effect for their then-current term as long as our products are being distributed, but are subject to specified termination rights held by each party, which may include by way of example, and depending on the form of agreement, termination upon: mutual agreement; material breach of the agreement by, or an insolvency of, either party; deadlock; change of control; changes in legal or regulatory conditions and termination of certain related agreements.  Additionally, we are entitled to terminate certain distribution agreements at any time without cause upon payment of a termination fee, including the distribution agreements with select Anheuser-Busch distributors (the AB Distributors) and certain distribution agreements with TCCC network bottlers that were entered into prior to 2015.
 
Certain of our material distribution arrangements for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, as amended from time to time, are described below:
 
(a)                   Amended and Restated Distribution Coordination Agreement with TCCC, pursuant to which we have designated, and in the future may designate, subject to TCCCs approval, territories in Canada and the United States in which bottlers from TCCCs network of wholly or partially-owned and independent bottlers will distribute and sell, or continue to distribute and sell, our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks.
 
(b)                  Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement with Coca-Cola Refreshments (CCR), pursuant to which CCR distributes, directly and through certain sub-distributors, our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in a large portion of the United States.
 
(c)                   Amended and Restated International Distribution Coordination Agreement  with TCCC, pursuant to which we have designated, and in the future may designate, countries in which we wish to appoint TCCC network bottlers to distribute and sell our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, subject to TCCCs approval.
 
(d)                  Additionally, we have entered into distribution agreements for certain of our Monster Energy® products with various TCCC network bottlers, both in the United States and internationally.
 
10



Strategic Brands Distribution Agreements
 
On June 12, 2015, in connection with the closing of the TCCC Transaction, TCCC transferred to the Company all of its rights in and to TCCCs worldwide energy drink business including: NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Play®, Power Play®, Relentless®, Nalu® and other brands (the Strategic Brands).
 
We have entered into distribution coordination agreements with TCCC pursuant to which we have designated, and in the future may designate, subject to TCCCs approval, territories in which TCCC network bottlers will distribute our Strategic Brands energy drinks.
 
We have entered into agreements with various TCCC network bottlers, both in the United States and internationally, providing for the distribution and sale of our Strategic Brands energy drinks.
 
Distribution levels vary by product and geographic location. Gross sales outside the United States accounted for $888.7 million, $713.2 million and $657.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
The principal raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products are aluminum cans, aluminum Cap Cans, sleek aluminum cans, aluminum cans with re-sealable ends, PET plastic bottles as well as flavors, juice concentrates, glucose, sugar, sucralose, milk, cream, protein, dietary ingredients and other packaging materials, the costs of which are subject to fluctuations.
 
The AFF Transaction brought our primary flavor supplier in-house, secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors for our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks in perpetuity and further enhanced our flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities. We also purchase flavors from other suppliers as well as juices, dietary ingredients, glucose, sugar, sucralose, other sweeteners and other ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States and abroad.
 
For our Strategic Brands energy drinks, we purchase concentrates and/or beverage bases from TCCC in the United States and abroad, and may purchase certain other ingredients from independent suppliers located in the United States. As part of the TCCC Transaction, we acquired ownership of the flavor formulas for the Strategic Brands, with some limited exceptions.
 
With regard to our Java Monster® and Muscle Monster® product lines, the dairy and protein industries are subject to shortages and increased demand from time to time, which may result in production disruption and/or higher prices.
 
For certain flavors purchased from third-party suppliers and used in a limited number of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and/or our Strategic Brands energy drinks, these third-party flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to certain of their flavor formulas. We do not have possession of the list of such flavor ingredients or formulas used in the production of certain of our products and certain of our blended concentrates, and we may be unable to obtain comparable flavors or concentrates from alternative suppliers on short notice. Our third-party flavor suppliers generally do not make such flavors and/or blended concentrates available to other third parties. We have identified alternative suppliers for many of the ingredients contained in many of our beverages. However, industry-wide shortages of certain fruits and fruit juices, coffee, tea, dairy-based products, dietary ingredients and sweeteners have been, and could from time to time in the future be, encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products.
 
11



We continually endeavor to develop back-up sources of supply for certain of our flavors and concentrates purchased from third-party suppliers, as well as negotiate arrangements with suppliers, which would enable us to obtain access to certain of such concentrates or flavor formulas under certain circumstances. We have been partially successful in these endeavors. Additionally, in a limited number of cases, contractual restrictions and/or the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals and licenses may limit our ability to enter into agreements with alternative suppliers, manufacturers and/or distributors.
 
Competition
 
The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors as well as promotional and marketing strategies. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of companies, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do.
 
Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include taste and flavor of products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new and unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, brand exposure and marketing as well as pricing. We also compete for distributors who will give our products more focus than those of our competitors, provide stable and reliable distribution and secure adequate shelf space in retail outlets. Competitive pressures in the alternative, energy, coffee and functional beverage categories could cause our products to be unable to gain or to lose market share or we could experience price erosion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
We have experienced and continue to experience competition from new entrants in the energy drink and energy shot categories. A number of companies who market and distribute iced teas, juice cocktails and enhanced waters in larger volume packages, such as 16- and 20-ounce glass and plastic bottles (including Sobe, Sobe Life Water, BODYARMOR, Vitamin Water, Snapple, Arizona, Fuse, Ocean Spray, Honest Tea, Gold Peak Tea) and 12- and 16-ounce cans (such as Mountain Dew Kickstart) have added dietary ingredients to their products with a view to marketing their products as functional or energy beverages or as having functional benefits. We believe that many of those products contain lower levels of dietary ingredients, principally deliver refreshment and are positioned differently from our energy or functional drinks.
 
We are also subject to increasing levels of regulatory issues particularly in relation to the registration and taxation of our products in certain new international markets, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. (See Government Regulation below for additional information).
 
We compete not only for consumer preference, but also for maximum marketing and sales efforts by multi-brand licensed bottlers, brokers and distributors, many of which have a principal affiliation with competing companies and brands. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and in many cases with products of much larger and in some cases better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers such as TCCC, PepsiCo, Inc. (PepsiCo), The Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (the DPS Group) and Red Bull Gmbh. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation.

Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image-enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize push-pull methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including racks, coolers and barrel coolers), advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials to encourage demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and sports figures, personality endorsements (including from television and other well-known sports personalities), sampling and sponsorship of selected athletes, teams, series, bands, esports, causes and events. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising (directly and through our sponsorships and endorsements) and coupons may also be used to promote our brands.
 
We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually appealing and distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we will continue to reevaluate from time to time.
 
Where appropriate, we partner with our retailers and wholesalers to assist our marketing efforts.
 
We increased expenditures for our sales and marketing programs by approximately 16.8% in 2016 compared to 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we employed 1,836 employees in sales and marketing activities, of which 1,108 were employed on a full-time basis.
 
Customers
 
Our customers are primarily full service beverage bottlers/distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, food service customers and the military. Percentages of our gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are reflected below. Such information includes sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage bottlers/distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage bottlers/distributors in turn sell certain of our products to some of the same customer types listed below. We limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to our full service bottlers/distributors without reference to such bottlers/distributors sales to their own customers.

 | 2016 | 2015 | 2014
---------------------------------------------------+------+------+-----
U.S. full service bottlers/distributors | 65% | 65% | 62% 
Club stores and mass merchandisers | 8% | 9% | 9% 
International full service bottlers/distributors | 25% | 23% | 23% 
Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers | 1% | 2% | 4% 
Other | 1% | 1% | 2% 

 
Our customers include CCR, Coca-Cola Bottling Company, CCBCC Operations, LLC, United Bottling Contracts Company, LLC, and certain other TCCC independent bottlers (collectively the TCCC North American Bottlers), Coca-Cola European Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Coca-Cola FEMSA, Coca-Cola Amatil, Swire Coca-Cola group in China, COFCO Coca-Cola group in China, Asahi, Kalil Bottling Group, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sams Club), Costco and select Anheuser-Busch distributors (the AB Distributors). In February 2015, in accordance with our then existing agreements with the applicable AB Distributors, we sent notices of termination to the majority of the AB Distributors in the United States for the termination of their respective distribution agreements. The associated distribution rights relating to such terminated distribution agreements have been transitioned to TCCCs network of owned or controlled bottlers/distributors and independent bottlers/distributors as of the effective date of termination of the affected AB Distributors rights in the applicable territories. As of March 1, 2017, distribution rights in the U.S. representing approximately 94% of the target case sales have been transitioned to TCCCs distribution network. TCCC, through certain wholly-owned subsidiaries (the TCCC Subsidiaries), accounted for approximately 41%, 43% and 29% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales of ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters accounting for the highest sales volumes. We believe that the volume of sales in the beverage industry are affected by weather conditions. However, the energy drink category appears to be less seasonal than traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets, particularly internationally, where temperature fluctuations may be more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of our finished products and increased or decreased advertising and promotional expenses.
Intellectual Property
 
We presently have more than 8,000 registered trademarks and pending applications in various countries worldwide, and we apply for new trademarks on an ongoing basis. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and other intellectual property as very important to our business. We consider Monster® (registered outside of the United States in certain jurisdictions), Monster Energy®, ®, M Monster Energy®, Monster Rehab®, Java Monster®, Muscle Monster®, Punch Monster®, Juice Monster®, Unleash the Beast®, Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology®,  BU®, Nalu®, NOS®, Full Throttle®, Burn®, Mother®, Ultra®, Play® and Power Play®, Gladiator®, Relentless®, Samurai® and BPM® to be our core trademarks. In addition, as a result of the AFF Transaction, we secured the intellectual property of our most important flavors for certain of our Monster Energy® Brand energy drinks in perpetuity.

We protect our trademarks by applying for registrations and registering our trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with government agencies in other countries around the world, particularly where our products are distributed and sold.  We assert copyright ownership of the statements, graphics and content appearing on the packaging of our products and in our marketing materials.  We aggressively pursue individuals and/or entities seeking to profit from the unauthorized use of our trademarks and copyrights, including, without limitation, wholesalers, street vendors, retailers, online auction site sellers and website operators. In addition to initiating civil actions against these individuals and entities, we work with law enforcement officials where appropriate.
 
Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic.  Registrations of trademarks can generally be renewed as long as the trademarks are in use.
 
We also enforce and protect our trademark rights against third parties infringing or disparaging our trademarks by opposing registration of conflicting trademarks and initiating litigation as necessary.
 
Government Regulation
 
The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to various U.S. federal and state regulations, including but not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act); the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various environmental statutes; California Proposition 65 and a number of other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, marketing, labeling and ingredients of such products. Outside the United States, the production, distribution and sale of many of our products are also subject to numerous statutes and regulations.
 
We also may in the future be affected by other existing, proposed and potential future regulations or regulatory actions, including those described below, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A  Risk Factors  Changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations below for additional information.
 
Furthermore, legislation may be introduced in the United States and other countries at the federal, state and municipal level in respect of each of the subject areas discussed below.  Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as it affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages.  There also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages, as discussed below.
 
Product Labeling and Advertising. We are subject to Proposition 65 in California, a law which requires that a specified warning be provided before exposing California consumers to any product that contains in excess of threshold amounts of a substance listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of the product in question exposes consumers to an average daily quantity of a listed substance that is below that threshold amount, which is determined either by scientific criteria set forth in applicable regulations or via a safe harbor threshold that may be established by the state, or the substance is naturally occurring, is the result of necessary cooking, or is subject to another applicable exception.
 
In May 2015, bisphenol-A (BPA), a food-grade chemical commonly used in the coating of the interiors of aluminum cans, was added to the Proposition 65 list, but California has not yet established a safe harbor threshold for exposure to BPA by ingestion.  If we are required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in certain locations where our products are sold, it will be difficult to predict whether, or to what extent, such a warning would have an impact on sales of our products in those locations or elsewhere. Certain of our aluminum cans suppliers are now evaluating alternative BPA non-intent coating for consideration.
 
15



In addition, in May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) revised regulations with respect to serving size information and nutrition labeling on food and beverage products, including a new requirement to disclose the amount of added sugars in such products. We may incur significant costs to alter our existing packaging materials to comply with this and other new regulations, which are scheduled to go into effect on July 26, 2018. Additionally, the new regulations may impact, reduce and/or otherwise affect the purchase and consumption of our products by consumers.
 
Further, the City of San Francisco recently enacted an ordinance that would require health warnings on advertisements for certain sugar-sweetened beverages, though enforcement has been delayed due to a lawsuit challenging the ordinance.
 
In July 2012, we received a subpoena from the Attorney General for the State of New York in connection with an investigation relating to the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and sale of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks. We cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry and what effect, if any, it may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
In October 2012, we received a written request for information from the City Attorney for the City and County of San Francisco concerning the Companys advertising and marketing of its Monster Energy® brand energy drinks and specifically concerning the safety of its products for consumption by adolescents. In 2013, the City Attorney filed an initial complaint against the Company, which was amended over the course of the legal proceedings. In 2017, the City Attorney and the Company settled the action on terms acceptable to the Company. See Part I, Item 3  Legal Proceedings below for additional information.
 
Other countries, such as Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Yemen and the United Arab Emirates, are also considering labeling requirements, which may require us to amend our labels and warning statements.
 
Age and Other Restrictions on Energy Drink Products. Proposals to limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age, and/or restrict the venues in which energy drinks can be sold and/or to restrict the use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly food stamps) to purchase energy drinks have been raised and/or enacted in certain U.S. states, counties, municipalities and/or in certain foreign countries. For example, Lithuania prohibits the sale of energy drinks to persons under the age of 18, and Latvia restricts advertising of energy drinks, prohibits sales in educational establishments and prohibits the sale to persons under the age of 18 of energy drinks containing certain ingredients (such as taurine).
 
Excise Taxes on Energy Drinks.  Legislation that would impose an excise tax on sweetened beverages has been proposed in Congress, in some state legislatures (including Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Oregon, Rhode Island and Texas) and by some local governments, with excise taxes generally ranging between $0.01 and $0.02 per ounce of sweetened beverage.  Berkeley, California became the first jurisdiction to pass such a measure, and a general tax of $0.01 per ounce on certain sweetened drinks, including energy drinks, became effective on January 1, 2015. Five other U.S. jurisdictions (Albany, Oakland and San Francisco, California; Boulder, Colorado and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) passed similar measures in 2016. The imposition of such taxes on our products would increase the cost of certain of our products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make certain of our products less affordable. Excise taxes on sweetened beverages already are in effect in certain foreign countries where we do business. For example, Mexico instituted a 25% excise tax on certain energy drinks, to which our products are currently not subject and Mexico has also enacted a $1 MXN tax per liter on sugar-sweetened beverages. In addition, legislation has been proposed that would specifically impose excise taxes on energy drinks. For example, Estonia and Ukraine are considering proposals that would impose an excise tax on energy drinks. Such targeted legislation has been passed in other countries. For instance, Hungary has instituted an excise tax to which our products are subject. Saudi Arabia has indicated that it will begin applying a selective tax of 100% on energy drinks as early as the second quarter of 2017, and there are indications that similar measures may be enacted in other Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
 
16



Limits on Caffeine Content.  Legislation has been proposed to limit the amount of caffeine that may be contained in beverages, including energy drinks. Some jurisdictions where we do business have prescribed limited caffeine content for beverages. For example, on January 1, 2013, regulations took effect in Canada that limit the amount of caffeine contained in any beverage in a single-serving can or bottle to less than 180 milligrams. We adjusted the caffeine levels in certain of our Monster Energy® products that are sold in Canada to address these regulations, although the majority of our products were unaffected. Caffeine limit restrictions or restrictions on combining caffeine with other ingredients have also been implemented or proposed in other jurisdictions, including India. Such restrictions could require reformulations of certain of our products. However, we may not be able to satisfactorily reformulate our products in all jurisdictions that adopt similar legislation.
 
Limitations on Container Size. We package our products in a variety of different package types and sizes including, for certain of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks, aluminum cans larger than 16 fluid ounces. Certain jurisdictions, such as the member states of the Gulf Corporation Council as well as Yemen are considering container size limitations on energy drinks which may require us to change the size of our products sold in these countries.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Our operations in other countries are subject to similar laws and regulations that may be applicable in such countries. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position.
 
Container Deposits. Various municipalities, states and foreign countries require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary by jurisdiction. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been, and may in the future be, introduced in certain U.S. states, counties, municipalities and in certain foreign countries.
 
In California, we are required to collect redemption values from our customers and to remit such redemption values to the State of California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold. In certain other states and countries where our products are sold, we are also required to collect deposits from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective jurisdictions based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed a total of 2,646 employees, of which 1,910 were employed on a full-time basis. Of our 2,646 employees, we employed 810 in administrative and operational capacities and 1,836 persons in sales and marketing capacities.
