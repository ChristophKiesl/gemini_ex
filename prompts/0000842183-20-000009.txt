Item 1. Business
The terms “Company,” “RPT,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to RPT Realty, RPT Realty, L.P., and/or their subsidiaries, as the context may require. The content of our website and the websites of third parties noted herein is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
General
RPT Realty owns and operates a national portfolio of open-air shopping destinations principally located in top U.S. markets. The Company's shopping centers offer diverse, locally-curated consumer experiences that reflect the lifestyles of their surrounding communities and meet the modern expectations of the Company's retail partners. The Company is a fully integrated and self-administered REIT publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). The common shares of beneficial interest of the Company, par value $0.01 per share (the “common shares”), are listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “RPT”. As of December 31, 2019, our property portfolio consisted of 49 shopping centers (including five shopping centers owned through a joint venture) (the "aggregate portfolio") representing 11.9 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”).  As of December 31, 2019, the Company's pro-rata share of the aggregate portfolio was 94.7% leased.
The Company's principal executive offices are located at 19 West 44th Street, Suite 1002, New York, New York 10036 and its telephone number is (212) 221-1261. The Company’s website is rptrealty.com. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 104 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating partnership, RPT Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership” or “OP”).  The Operating Partnership, either directly or indirectly through partnerships or limited liability companies, holds fee title to all of our properties.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Partnership.  As of December 31, 2019, we owned approximately 97.7% of the Operating Partnership.  The interests of the limited partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements and the limited partners are generally individuals or entities that contributed interests in certain assets or entities to the Operating Partnership in exchange for units of limited partnership interest (“OP Units”).  The holders of OP Units are entitled to exchange them for our common shares on a 1:1 basis or for cash.  The form of payment is at our election.
We operate in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  Certain of our operations, including property and asset management, as well as ownership of certain land parcels, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), which are subject to federal and state income taxes.
Business Strategy
Our goal is to be a dominant shopping center owner, with a focus on the following:
•Own and manage high quality open-air shopping centers predominantly concentrated in the top U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (“MSA”);
•Curate our real estate to maximize its value while being aligned with the future of the shopping center industry by leveraging technology, optimizing distribution points for brick-and-mortar and e-commerce purchases, engaging in best-in-practice sustainability programs and developing a personalized appeal to attract and engage the next generation of shoppers;
•Maintain value creation redevelopment and expansion pipeline; 
•Maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility; and 
•Retain motivated, talented and high performing employees.
Key methods to achieve our strategy:
•Deliver above average relative shareholder return and generate outsized consistent and sustainable Consolidated Same Property Net Operating Income (“Same Property NOI”) and Operating Funds from Operations (“Operating FFO”) per share growth;
•Pursue selective redevelopment projects with significant pre-leasing for which we expect to achieve attractive returns on investment; 
•Sell assets that no longer meet our long-term strategy and redeploy the proceeds to lease, redevelop and acquire assets in our core and target markets; 
•Achieve lower leverage while maintaining low variable interest rate risk; and
•Retain access to diverse sources of capital, maintain liquidity through borrowing capacity under our unsecured line of credit and minimize the amount of debt maturities in a single year.
Our portfolio consists of community, lifestyle and power center properties tenanted by national and regional chain stores, market-leading supermarkets, as well as a strong lineup of smaller national, regional and local retailers that optimize the overall merchandise mix and reflect the community demographics of each center. Our centers also include entertainment components, including theaters, fitness centers and restaurants, which, in addition to supermarkets, are daily drivers of consumer traffic to our properties. National chain anchor tenants in our centers include, among others, TJ Maxx/Marshalls, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Ross Stores and ULTA Salon. Supermarket anchor tenants in our centers include, among others, Publix Super Market, Whole Foods, Kroger, Aldi, and Sprouts. Theater, fitness and restaurant tenants include, among others, Regal Cinema, LA Fitness, Starbucks and Panera. Our shopping centers are primarily located in key growth markets in the 40 largest MSAs in the United States such as Metro Detroit, Cincinnati, Miami, Jacksonville, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Tampa/Lakeland and Nashville.
Operating Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our operating objective is to maximize the risk-adjusted return on invested capital at our shopping centers. We seek to do so by increasing the property operating income of our centers, controlling our capital expenditures, monitoring our tenants' credit risk and taking actions to mitigate our exposure to that tenant credit risk.
During 2019, our properties reported the following leasing activity, which is shown at pro-rata except for number of leasing transactions and square feet:

 | Leasing Transactions | Square Footage | Base Rent/SF (1) | Prior Rent/SF (2) | Tenant Improvements/SF (3) | Leasing Commissions/SF | 
Renewals | 131 | | 766,892 | | $17.51 | $16.12 | $1.28 | $0.12 
New Leases - Comparable | 34 | | 88,197 | | $27.15 | $21.94 | $50.49 | $11.08
New Leases - Non-Comparable (4) | 45 | | 303,757 | | $14.24 | N/A | $36.76 | $6.09 
Total | 210 | | 1,158,846 | | $17.38 | N/A | $14.35 | $2.52 

(1) Base rent represents contractual minimum rent under the new lease for the first 12 months of the term. 
(2) Prior rent represents minimum rent, if any, paid by the prior tenant in the final 12 months of the term. 
(3) Includes estimated tenant improvement cost, tenant allowances, and landlord costs. Excludes first generation space and leases related to development and redevelopment activity. 
(4) Non-comparable lease transactions include (i) leases for space vacant for greater than 12 months and (ii) leases signed where the previous and current lease do not have a consistent lease structure.
Investing Activities and Significant Transactions
Our investing objective is to generate an attractive risk-adjusted return on capital invested in acquisitions, developments, and redevelopments. In addition we seek to sell land or shopping centers that we deem to be fully valued or that no longer meet our investment criteria. We underwrite acquisitions based upon current cash flow, projections of future cash flow and scenario analyses that take into account the risks and opportunities of ownership. We underwrite development of new shopping centers on the same basis, but also take into account the unique risks of entitling land, constructing buildings and leasing newly built space.
In December 2019, we acquired a 76,000 square foot Target shadow-anchored shopping center in Austin, Texas for $33.9 million. We also sold two shopping centers and one land outparcel for aggregate gross proceeds of $69.4 million in the first half of 2019. 
On December 10, 2019, we contributed five properties valued at $244.0 million to a newly formed joint venture with an affiliate of GIC Private Limited (“GIC”), Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, referred to as R2G Venture LLC (“R2G”), and received $118.3 million in gross proceeds for the 48.5% stake in R2G that was acquired by GIC. Additionally, GIC has committed up to $200.0 million of additional capital to R2G over the next three years to fund its 48.5% share of up to an aggregate of $412.4 million of potential future acquisitions by R2G of grocery-anchored shopping centers in target markets in the U.S. RPT retained a 51.5% stake in R2G and receives property management, construction management and leasing fees from R2G. The Company will also be responsible for the day-to-day management of the properties as well as sourcing future acquisitions for R2G. Both GIC and RPT will have consent rights for all future acquisitions, and GIC has approval rights in connection with annual budgets and other specified major decisions. During the investment period for R2G, RPT has agreed to present all opportunities above a specified size threshold to acquire grocery-anchored shopping centers in attractive-high growth markets in the United States to R2G and not to acquire, invest in or source any such opportunities that have not previously been presented to R2G and declined by GIC.
Unless specified events occur, neither RPT nor GIC will have the right to force a sale of R2G or its assets within the first five years following its formation. Thereafter, both RPT and GIC will have forced sale rights, subject to a right to participate in the purchase for the other member.
See Item 2. Properties, for information regarding the five properties contributed to R2G.
Refer to Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information related to acquisitions and dispositions.
Financing Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our financing objective is to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet to ensure access to capital at a competitive cost.  In general, we seek to increase our financial flexibility by increasing our pool of unencumbered properties, maintaining a well-laddered debt maturity profile and primarily borrowing on an unsecured basis.  In keeping with our objective, we routinely benchmark our balance sheet on a variety of measures to our peers in the shopping center sector and REITs in general.  
Specifically, we completed the following financing transactions during 2019:
Debt
On April 30, 2019, we redeemed all of our outstanding junior subordinated notes due 2038, which accrued interest at a variable rate of LIBOR plus 3.30% for an aggregate purchase price of $28.6 million, consisting of the outstanding principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date. In conjunction with this redemption, we wrote off unamortized deferred financing costs of $0.6 million.
On November 6, 2019, the Operating Partnership entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “credit agreement”), which consists of an unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $350.0 million (the “revolving credit facility”) and term loan facilities of $310.0 million (the “term loan facilities” and, together with the revolving credit facility, the “unsecured revolving line of credit”). The revolving credit facility matures on November 6, 2023 and can be extended up to one year to 2024 through two six-month options, subject to continued compliance with the terms of the credit agreement and the payment of an extension fee of 0.075%. Borrowings on the revolving credit facility are priced on a leverage grid ranging from LIBOR plus 105 basis points to LIBOR plus 150 basis points. 
The term loan facilities mature in five separate tranches ranging from March 2023 to February 2027 and are priced on a leverage grid ranging from LIBOR plus 120 basis points to LIBOR plus 220 basis points. The credit agreement allows for the right to request increases in the revolving and term loan commitments or the making of additional term loans by up to an additional $340.0 million to a maximum aggregated amount not to exceed $1.0 billion. A portion of the proceeds from the credit agreement were used to repay our $75.0 million term loan due 2020 and our $75.0 million term loan due 2021 for an aggregate amount of $150.0 million. In conjunction with this early repayment, we wrote off deferred financing costs of $0.3 million.
Also on November 6, 2019, we repaid $100.0 million which constituted repayment in full of the Operating Partnership's $50.0 million 4.16% senior unsecured notes due 2024 and its $50.0 million 4.30% senior unsecured notes due 2026, each issued pursuant to the note purchase agreement dated September 8, 2014, as amended. Accordingly, on November 6, 2019, all outstanding notes and other obligations of the Operating Partnership and guarantors under such note purchase agreement were paid and satisfied in full. In conjunction with this early repayment, we wrote off unamortized deferred financings costs of $0.1 million.
On December 27, 2019, we entered into a note purchase agreement with the institutional investors named therein and closed a private placement of the Operating Partnership’s $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.15% Senior Guaranteed Notes due December 27, 2029 pursuant thereto. Such notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The notes have an annual fixed interest rate of 4.15% and mature on December 27, 2029. A portion of the proceeds were used to repay $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.13% Series A Notes due 2022 for an aggregate amount of $26.4 million, which included a prepayment penalty of $1.4 million. In conjunction with this early repayment, we wrote off unamortized deferred financings costs of $0.1 million. A portion of the proceeds was also used to repay the 6.50% fixed rate mortgage loan encumbering West Oaks II and Spring Meadows Place, with an aggregate principal balance of $24.9 million.
At each of December 31, 2019 and 2018 we had $349.8 million available to draw under our unsecured revolving line of credit, subject to compliance with applicable covenants.
Equity
During the first half of 2019, we had an at-the-market equity program pursuant to which we could sell up to an aggregate of 8.0 million common shares from time to time, in our sole discretion. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not issue any common shares under the program. The sale of such shares issuable pursuant to the program was registered with the SEC on our registration statement on Form S-3, which expired in June 2019.
Sustainability
We continue to advance our commitment to sustainability, with a focus on achieving goals in each of the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) areas of sustainability. We believe that sustainability initiatives are a vital part of supporting our primary goal to maximize value for our shareholders. 
Our commitment to ESG principles starts with our employees. We are establishing a culture that intentionally attracts and retains talented employees to work in an engaging and energetic team environment that shares a passion for innovation, transparency and excellence. Our employees are awarded competitive compensation packages, including healthcare benefits for employees and their families, participation in a 401(k) plan, paid time-off benefits and employee referral bonuses. In addition, we strive to provide our employees with a healthy work-life balance through RPT Remote, our flexible work initiative, and our newly enacted Parental Leave Policy. We are also focused on creating healthy workspaces and promoting health and wellness for our employees and their families. In 2019, we won Michigan’s Best and Brightest in Wellness for the seventh year in a row. The Best and Brightest in Wellness awards program honors organizations that are making their workplaces, their employees and the community a healthier place to live and work. We are also devoted to philanthropy initiatives and partner with organizations that are committed to improving the overall quality of life in our communities. Each month, we support a local community organization through charitable giving or volunteerism. 
In 2019, we created an ESG taskforce and enacted ESG polices aimed at providing the necessary framework to commence comprehensive sustainability initiatives. We established long-term sustainability goals with regard to the reduction of electricity consumption, water usage and waste diversion, focusing on our objectives of safeguarding the environment while improving the energy efficiency of our portfolio and lowering operating costs. In 2020, we intend to file RPT’s first Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark assessment, providing more transparency regarding our sustainability polices, initiatives and performance.
Competition
We compete with many other entities for the acquisition of shopping centers and land suitable for new developments, including other REITs, private institutional investors and other owner-operators of shopping centers.  In particular, larger REITs may enjoy competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital.  These competitors may increase the market prices we would have to pay in order to acquire properties.  If we are unable to acquire properties that meet our criteria at prices we deem reasonable, our ability to grow will be adversely affected.
Our tenants compete with alternate forms of retailing, including on-line shopping, home shopping networks and mail order catalogs.  Alternate forms of retailing may reduce the demand for space in our shopping centers. Because our ability to generate revenue may be connected to the success of our tenants, we indirectly share exposure to these same competitive factors. 
Further, our shopping centers generally compete for tenants with similar properties located in the same neighborhood, community or region.  Although we believe we own high quality centers in desirable geographic locations, competing centers may be newer, better located or have a better tenant mix.  We also believe we compete with other centers on the basis of rental rates and management and operational expertise. In addition, new centers or retail stores may be developed, increasing the supply of retail space competing with our centers or taking retail sales from our tenants.  To remain competitive, we evaluate all of the factors affecting our centers and work to position them accordingly to enable us to compete effectively. 
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances disposed, stored, released, generated, manufactured or discharged from, on, at, onto, under or in such property. Environmental laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such hazardous or toxic substance.
We are not aware of any contamination which may have been caused by us or any of our tenants that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. As part of our risk management activities, we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs, the purpose of which is to expedite and facilitate satisfactory compliance with environmental laws and regulations should contaminants need to be remediated. We also have an environmental insurance policy that covers us against third party liabilities and remediation costs. While we believe that we do not have any material exposure to environmental remediation costs, we cannot give assurance that changes in the law or new discoveries of contamination will not result in additional liabilities to us.
