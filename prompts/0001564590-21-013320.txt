Business Overview
 Village Farms International, Inc. (“VFF”) the parent company, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”, “Village Farms”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) are one of the largest and longest-operating vertically integrated greenhouse growers in North America and the only publicly traded greenhouse produce company in Canada. Following our acquisition of the remaining 41.3% interest in British Columbia-based Pure Sunfarms Corp. (“Pure Sunfarms”) that was completed on November 2, 2020 (the “Pure Sunfarms Acquisition”), which increased our ownership of Pure Sunfarms to 100%, we now own one of the single largest cannabis growing operations in the world, one of the lowest-cost greenhouse producers and one of the best-selling brands in Canada. Pure Sunfarms leverages our 30 years of experience as a vertically integrated greenhouse grower for the rapidly developing cannabis opportunity in Canada. Pure Sunfarms is currently one of the largest producers of cannabis in Canada with distributions in five of the provinces: British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Its long-term objective is to be the leading low cost, high quality cannabis producer in Canada. 
 In our greenhouse operations, we produce and distribute fresh, premium-quality produce with consistency 365 days a year to national grocers in the U.S. and Canada from more than nine million square feet of Controlled Environment Agriculture (“CEA”) greenhouses in British Columbia and Texas, as well as from our partner greenhouses in British Columbia, Ontario, and Mexico. The Company primarily markets and distributes under its Village Farms® brand name to retail supermarkets and dedicated fresh food distribution companies throughout the United States and Canada. 
 The Company, through its subsidiary VF Clean Energy, Inc. (“VFCE”), owns and operates a 7.0 MW power plant from landfill gas that generates electricity and provides thermal heat, in colder months, to one of the Company’s adjacent British Columbia greenhouse facilities and sells electricity to British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority (“BC Hydro”). On November 10, 2020 we announced we will be transitioning this operation to a Renewable Natural Gas (“RNG”) operation in conjunction with Mas Energy, LLC which will enhance our financial return as well as provide food-grade CO2, which can be used in both our cannabis and produce growing operations in Delta, B.C.
 The Company entered the U.S. hemp business in the spring of 2019 after the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill. We established a joint venture, Village Fields Hemp USA, LLC, for multi-state outdoor hemp cultivation and CBD extraction, and initiated plans to pursue controlled environment hemp production at our Texas greenhouse operations.
 Internationally, we evaluate, and target select, nascent, legal cannabis and CBD opportunities with significant long-term potential, with an initial focus on the Asia-Pacific region through our investment in Australia-based Altum International Pty Ltd (“Altum”). 
 Our Canadian Cannabis Subsidiary – Pure Sunfarms Corp.
 Corporate History of Pure Sunfarms 
 In June 2017, the Company formed a Canadian joint venture, Pure Sunfarms, with Emerald Health Therapeutics, Inc. (“Emerald”), pursuant to a Shareholder Agreement dated June 6, 2017, between Village Farms and Emerald (the “Joint Venture Agreement”), to commence Canadian cannabis operations in anticipation of the adult use cannabis market becoming legal in October 2017. The Company contributed one of its Delta, B.C. greenhouses (“Delta 3”), along with the experienced grower management and Delta 3 workforce, to the joint venture in exchange for a 50% ownership interest in the joint venture. Emerald contributed C$20 million, which was paid in installments, and its existing cultivation license and cannabis expertise in exchange for the other 50% ownership interest in the joint venture. The Company also granted options to the joint venture to lease or own its two remaining Delta, B.C. greenhouses – Delta 1 and Delta 2. 
 In March 2019, Pure Sunfarms exercised its option on the Delta 2 facility. The Company contributed the facility to the joint venture in exchange for additional shares in Pure Sunfarms and Emerald contributed C$2.5 million and entered into an escrow agreement for an additional C$22.5 million in exchange for additional shares in the joint venture, subject to payments under the escrow agreement. Following a dispute regarding payments to be made under the escrow agreement, on March 2, 2020, the Company and Emerald agreed to increase the Company’s effective ownership of the joint venture to 53.5% as of November 19, 2019 and on March 6, 2020, the Company’s ownership in the joint venture was further increased to 57.4%. 
 On November 2, 2020, the Company completed the Pure Sunfarms Acquisition acquiring 36,958,500 Common Shares in the capital of Pure Sunfarms owned by Emerald, which increased the Company’s ownership of Pure Sunfarms to one hundred percent. The shares, representing 42.6% of the ownership, were acquired for a total purchase price of C$79.9 million (US$60.0 million), satisfied through a C$60.0 million (US$45.0 million) cash payment and a C$19.9 million (US$14.5 million) secured promissory note 
 1


payable to Emerald due on May 2, 2021 (the “Pure Sunfarms Acquisition”). The promissory note was paid in full to Emerald on February 5, 2021.
 The Pure Sunfarms Acquisition agreement contains representations and warranties customary for transactions of this nature negotiated between sophisticated purchasers and sellers acting at arm’s length, certain of which are qualified as to materiality and knowledge and subject to reasonable exceptions. Subject to certain exceptions, the representations and warranties of the Company and Emerald survive for a period of 18 months from the closing date of the Pure Sunfarms Acquisition. Certain “fundamental” representations, however, survive the closing of the Pure Sunfarms Acquisition for a period of six years. Pursuant to the agreement, each of the Company and Emerald have agreed, following closing, to indemnify the other party and its affiliates against any loss arising from a breach of a representation, warranty, or covenant given by the Company or Emerald, respectively, under the Pure Sunfarms Acquisition. The indemnity is subject to certain limitations, including that neither the Company nor Emerald are required to indemnify the other party unless and until losses exceed C$500,000, at which point Village Farms or Emerald, as the case may be, will be entitled to recover the full amount of such losses from the first dollar. The indemnity is also capped at 100% of the purchase price under the Pure Sunfarms Acquisition agreement and no party is liable for any losses resulting from any breach of any representation or warranty in the agreement if the party seeking indemnification knew about the inaccuracy or breach before closing.
 In addition, the Company and Emerald entered into a non-solicitation agreement on the closing date of the Pure Sunfarms Acquisition pursuant to which Emerald has agreed not to solicit or hire any employees of Pure Sunfarms or the Company for a period of three years following the closing date, subject to customary exceptions. Pure Sunfarms’ management and employees became part of the Company as of the closing date of the Pure Sunfarms Acquisition, and the Company began fully consolidating the financial results of Pure Sunfarms as a wholly owned subsidiary as of November 2, 2020. The transaction was immediately accretive to the Company’s net income.
 Business of Pure Sunfarms
During the course of 2017, the joint venture between Village Farms and Emerald applied for a cultivation license for the Delta 3 facility. In March 2018, the joint venture received its initial cultivation license for a portion of the Delta 3 facility and expanded its cultivation space via amendments to its cultivation license throughout 2018, culminating with the complete cultivation license for the entire 25-acre facility (1.1 million square feet) in March 2019. During 2018, the joint venture also hired a chief executive officer and adopted a name for the joint venture, Pure Sunfarms Corp. Pure Sunfarms commenced cultivation in the spring of 2018, after receiving its initial cultivation license.
 In July 2018, Pure Sunfarms received its wholesale sales license and commenced sales of its cannabis production in late September 2018, including sales to Emerald under a supply agreement for up to 40% of the production from Pure Sunfarms. Emerald continued to purchase cannabis from Pure Sunfarms until late June 2019 when it reduced taking its full 40% commitment and eventually ceased purchasing cannabis during the third quarter of 2019. In October 2019, Emerald notified Pure Sunfarms it was disputing its liabilities to Pure Sunfarms under the supply agreement. The dispute was settled pursuant to the Settlement Agreement dated March 2, 2020 and the supply agreement was cancelled as part of the dispute. 
 On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act came into effect, regulating both the medical and recreational cannabis markets in Canada and providing provincial, territorial, and municipal governments the authority to regulate the distribution and sale of recreational cannabis. Pure Sunfarms received an amendment to its sales license in September 2019 allowing it to commence sales to provincial boards. As of the date of this filing, Pure Sunfarms is directly selling to five provincial boards – Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. 
 Pure Sunfarms began producing cannabis in 2019. For the first nine months of 2019, Pure Sunfarms was predominately a wholesale supplier to other licensed producers including Emerald. In September 2019, Pure Sunfarms received its provincial sales license and commenced sales to the Ontario Cannabis Store (“OCS”) and British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch (“BCLDB”). In October 2019, Health Canada approved the second phase of recreational cannabis products including ingestible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals, referred to as Cannabis 2.0 products. 
 Throughout 2020, Pure Sunfarms commenced sales to three additional provinces, Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority (“SLGA”), Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis (“AGLC”) and Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries Corporation (“MLLC”), allowing availability of Pure Sunfarms’ products to five of Canada’s provinces. Pure Sunfarms continues to advance discussions with other provincial distributors for supply agreements to further expand its presence in the Canadian cannabis market. In May 2020, Pure Sunfarms received its cannabis cultivation license from Health Canada for the Delta 2 facility, providing an additional 1.1 million square feet of production capacity, enhancing its ability to grow, package and sell cannabis and cannabis extracts. Pure Sunfarms also received amended licensing from Health Canada in the fall of 2020, permitting in-house extraction operations and the sale of cannabis oils and derivative products directly to provincial boards and authorized retailers. To date, Delta 2 is in the construction phase with anticipated planting in the summer of 2021 of the western half of the greenhouse. We have the appropriate licenses for Delta 2 and will need receipt of attestation from Health Canada throughout the construction phase in order to plant.

Pure Sunfarms has continued expansion of its direct to provincial sales in 2020 and is now the top selling flower brand in Ontario based on weekly point of sales data. In addition, Pure Sunfarms launched new dried cannabis products such as pre-rolled flower and commenced sales of Cannabis 2.0 products, including pre-filled vape cartridges and bottled cannabis oils. Pure Sunfarms’ sales mix by channel was approximately 41% in the wholesale channel and 59% in the retail channel, significantly different from a predominantly wholesale market in 2019. We believe that Pure Sunfarms is the low-cost high-quality producer in the Canadian market and its low-cost structure, primarily driven by economies of scale and large-scale greenhouse experience, is sustainable and provides a competitive industry advantage. Pure Sunfarms’ cost structure should allow a continued increase of incremental market share as we go to market at a lower price for most of our products than other licensed producers can maintain. 
 Due to the Health Canada limitations on marketing, branding, and packaging rules, it is difficult to distinguish our products which places more emphasis on our ability to manage the price, potency and quality. Pure Sunfarms’ British Columbian grown flower and extracts continue to distinguish themselves from the competition due to the agricultural expertise of our growers, which we believe ensures the highest quality cannabis at the right price.
 The retail channel, or adult use channel, remains very competitive and continues to experience an oversupply situation as the licensed growers are producing more cannabis than the current legal adult use market is purchasing. This situation is a function of too many licensed producers, as well as a slow roll out of adult use licensed retail stores in provinces such as Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. Throughout 2020, the cannabis industry experienced significant expansion of adult use retail stores throughout Canada, albeit not as quickly as expected, the approval by Health Canada of the production and sale of Cannabis 2.0 derivative products, the scaling back by some licensed cultivators to meet revised demand expectations, and merger and consolidation activity that occurred during the year as cannabis companies identified potential synergies. As the industry matures, we believe that Pure Sunfarms will be well-positioned as one of the best-selling brands in Canada, while we continue to evaluate and seek to secure partnerships to realize future opportunities to expand our sales, products and footprint.
 Canadian Cannabis Industry Overview
 Legal History of Medical Cannabis in Canada
 Prior to October 17, 2018, the production, distribution, and use of cannabis for medical use was and has been legal in Canada since 2001, first under the federal Medical Marihuana Access Regulations, which established a legal regime for the licensing of cannabis producers and the sale of dried cannabis to registered patients pursuant to a medical document provided by a health care practitioner. The Medical Marihuana Access Regulations were later replaced with the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (“MMPR”), and then the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (“ACMPR”) as a result of a decision by the Federal Court of Canada (the “Federal Court”) in Allard v. Canada. The Federal Court held that requiring individuals to obtain cannabis only from federally licensed cannabis producers (“License Holders”) violated liberty and security rights protected by section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Federal Court found that individuals who require cannabis for medical purposes did not have “reasonable access” under the MMPR regime. Accordingly, the ACMPR contemplated both access to medical cannabis through a License Holder or through personal production exemptions, thereby giving patients reasonable access to, and choice of, cannabis product. The ACMPR provided three possible alternatives for individuals to access cannabis for medical purposes: (i) they can continue to access quality-controlled cannabis by registering with federal License Holders; (ii)they can register with Health Canada to produce a limited amount of cannabis for their own medical purposes (starting materials must be obtained from a License Holder); or (iii) they can designate someone else who is registered with Health Canada to produce cannabis on their behalf (starting materials must be obtained from a License Holder). 
 Current Applicable Regulatory Regime
 On October 17, 2018, the federal Cannabis Act and accompanying Regulations, including the Cannabis Regulations, the new Industrial Hemp Regulations (“IHR”) (together with the Cannabis Regulations, collectively, the “Regulations”), came into force, legalizing the production, distribution, and sale of cannabis for adult non-medicinal (i.e. recreational) purposes, as well as incorporating the existing medical cannabis regulatory scheme under one complete framework.
 On October 17, 2019, the Cannabis Regulations were amended to expand the legally permitted categories of cannabis products and support the production and sale of edible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals. The amendments, among other things, outline the rules relating to packaging, labelling, and advertising, shelf-stability, cannabinoid concentration levels, restrictions on ingredients, and production and sanitation standards for edible cannabis, cannabis extracts and cannabis topical products. December 16, 2019 was the earliest date that the new classes of cannabis products could be available for sale. Edible cannabis, as well as extracts and topicals, are all now available for sale in the legalized recreational market in Canada.
 Pursuant to the federal regulatory framework in Canada, each province and territory may adopt its own laws governing the distribution, sale and consumption of cannabis and cannabis accessories within the province or territory. All Canadian provinces and territories have implemented mechanisms for the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes within those jurisdictions, and retail models vary between jurisdictions.

The Cannabis Act maintains separate access to cannabis for medical purposes, including providing that import and export licenses and permits will only be issued in respect of cannabis for medical or scientific purposes or in respect of industrial hemp. Part 14 of the Cannabis Regulations sets out the regime for medical cannabis following legalization, which is substantively the same as the ACMPR with adjustments to create consistency with rules for non-medical use, improve patient access, and reduce the risk of abuse within the medical access system. Patients who have the authorization of their healthcare provider continue to have access to cannabis, either purchased directly from a federal License Holder authorized to sell for medical purposes, or by registering to produce a limited amount of cannabis for their own medical purposes or designating someone to produce cannabis for them.
 Adult Use Cannabis
 The Company intends to participate in the Canadian adult use market for cannabis in compliance with all applicable federal and provincial laws and regulations concerning the Canadian adult use cannabis market. The Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations provide a licensing scheme for the production, importation, exportation, testing, packaging, labelling, sending, delivery, transportation, sale, possession, and disposal of cannabis for non-medicinal use (i.e., adult recreational use). Transitional provisions of the Cannabis Act provide that every license issued under the ACMPR that is in force immediately before the day on which the Cannabis Act comes into force is deemed to be a license issued under the Cannabis Act, and that such license will continue in force until it is revoked or expires.
 Below are additional highlights of the Cannabis Act:
  
• | Places restrictions on the amount of cannabis that individuals can possess and distribute, and on public consumption and use, and prohibits the sale of cannabis unless authorized by the Cannabis Act.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Permits individuals who are 18 years of age or older to cultivate, propagate, and harvest up to and including four cannabis plants in their dwelling-house, propagated from a seed or plant material authorized by the Cannabis Act.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Restricts (but does not strictly prohibit) the promotion and display of cannabis, cannabis accessories and services related to cannabinoids to consumers, including restrictions on branding and a prohibition on false or misleading promotion and on sponsorships.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Permits the informational promotion of cannabis by entities licensed to produce, sell, or distribute cannabis in specified circumstances to individuals 18 years and older.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Introduces packaging and labelling requirements for cannabis and cannabis accessories and prohibits the sale of cannabis or cannabis accessories that could be appealing to young persons.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provides the designated minister with the power to recall any cannabis or class of cannabis on reasonable grounds that such a recall is necessary to protect public health or public safety.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establishes a national cannabis tracking system to monitor the movement of cannabis from where it is grown, to where it is processed, to where it is sold.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provides powers to inspectors for the purpose of administering and enforcing the Cannabis Act and a system for administrative monetary penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Licenses, Permits and Authorizations
 The Cannabis Regulations establish the following classes of licenses:
  
• | license for cultivation;
--+-------------------------


• | license for processing;
--+------------------------


• | license for analytical testing;
--+--------------------------------


• | license for sale;
--+------------------


• | license for research; and
--+--------------------------


• | a cannabis drug license.
--+-------------------------

 The Cannabis Regulations also create subclasses for cultivation licenses (standard cultivation, micro-cultivation and nursery) and processing licenses (standard processing and micro-processing). Different licenses and each sub-class therein, carry differing rules and requirements that are intended to be proportional to the public health and safety risks posed by each license category and each sub-class. Licenses that were issued under the ACMPR are deemed to be licenses issued under the Cannabis Act. Licenses issued under the Cannabis Act have associated expiry dates and are subject to renewal requirements.

Security Clearances
 Certain individuals associated with cannabis licensees, including individuals occupying “key positions”, directors, officers, individuals who exercise, or are in a position to exercise, direct control over the corporate licensee, and other individuals identified by the Minister of Health (the “Minister”), must hold a valid security clearance issued by the Minister. Under the Cannabis Regulations, the Minister may refuse to grant security clearances to individuals with associations to organized crime or with past convictions for, or an association with, drug trafficking, corruption, or violent offences. This was largely the approach in place under the ACMPR and other related regulations governing the licensed production of cannabis for medical purposes. Individuals having a history of nonviolent, lower-risk criminal activity (for example, simple possession of cannabis, or small-scale cultivation of cannabis plants) are not precluded from participating in the legal cannabis industry, however, grant of security clearance to such individuals is at the discretion of the Minister and such applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
Cannabis Tracking System
 Under the Cannabis Act, the Minister is authorized to establish and maintain a national cannabis tracking system. The purpose of this system is to track cannabis throughout the supply chain, to help prevent cannabis from being diverted to an illicit market or activity and to help prevent illicit cannabis from being a source of supply of cannabis in the legal market. Pursuant to the Ministry of Health’s Cannabis Tracking System Order (the “Order”), a holder of a federal license for cultivation, a license for processing or a license for sale for medical purposes that authorizes the possession of cannabis must report monthly to the Minister with specific information about their authorized activities with cannabis (e.g. cannabis inventory quantities), in the form and manner specified by the Minister. The Order also provides for monthly reporting by provincial bodies and provincially authorized private retailers of certain information in the form and manner specified by the Minister.
Cannabis Products
 The Cannabis Regulations set out the requirements for cannabis products that are permitted for sale at the retail level, including the limit on THC content, permitted ingredients, limit on pest control product residues, as well as microbial and chemical contaminants. As of October 17, 2019, the Cannabis Act and Cannabis Regulations permit the sale of the following classes of products: dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants, cannabis plant seeds, as well as cannabis edibles, cannabis extracts and cannabis topicals.
Packaging and Labeling
 The Cannabis Regulations set out strict requirements pertaining to the packaging and labelling of cannabis products. These requirements are intended to promote informed consumer choice and safe consumption and allow for the safe handling and transportation of cannabis, while also reducing the appeal of cannabis to youth.
 The Cannabis Regulations require all cannabis products to be packaged in a manner that is tamper-proof and child resistant. Strict limitations are also imposed on the use of colors, graphics, and other special characteristics of packaging. For example, all-over package coverings must be clear, and the interior surface and exterior surface of any container in which a cannabis product is packaged must be one uniform color. Cannabis package labels must include specific information, such as (i) product source information, including brand name, the class of cannabis and the name, phone number and email of the licensed processor or cultivator, (ii) mandatory warnings, including rotating health warning messages on Health Canada’s list of standard health warnings; (iii) the Health Canada standardized cannabis symbol; and (iv) information specifying THC and CBD content.
 A cannabis product’s brand name may only be displayed once on the principal display panel or, if there are separate principal display panels for English and French, only once on each principal display panel. It can be in any font style and any size, so long as it is equal to or smaller than the health warning message. The font must not be in metallic or fluorescent color. In addition to the brand name, only one other brand element can be displayed. Such brand element must meet the same requirements noted above as the brand name, and if an image, it must be in a size equal to or smaller than the surface area of the standardized cannabis symbol.
 Health Products Containing Cannabis
 Health Canada is taking a scientific, evidenced-based approach for the oversight of health products with cannabis that may be approved with health claims, including prescription and non-prescription drugs, veterinary drugs, and medical devices. Under the current regulatory framework, health products are subject to the Food and Drugs Act (Canada) and its regulations and may be additionally regulated by the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations. For many of these products, pre-market approval from Health Canada is required.
 Possible Changes to the Federal Regulatory Framework
 On December 12, 2020, Health Canada issued a notice of intent, consulting stakeholders on the expansion of non-medicinal cannabis research involving human participants. Health Canada proposed to amend the Cannabis Act, the Cannabis Regulations and the Food and Drug Regulations so that non-medicinal cannabis research involving human participants is regulated exclusively under 
 5


the cannabis legislation. Further, Health Canada also sought feedback on a host of other regulatory issues, including public possession, product labeling, micro-class and nursery licensing, and COVID-19 measures.
 The consultation closed on January 11, 2021. Pending results of the consultation, it is possible that Health Canada may introduce legislative updates in the future.
 Provincial and Territorial Regulatory Framework for Recreational Cannabis
 While the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation of the commercial production of cannabis and related matters by the federal government, the Cannabis Act provides the provinces and territories of Canada with authority to adopt their own laws governing the distribution, sale and consumption of cannabis and cannabis accessory products within the province or territory, permitting for example, provincial and territorial governments to set lower possession limits for individuals and higher age requirements. Currently, each of the Canadian provincial and territorial jurisdictions has established the minimum age for cannabis use to be 19 years old, except for Québec and Alberta, where the minimum age is 21 and 18, respectively.
 The provinces and territories are responsible for the establishment of a retail distribution system for adult use cannabis in their respective jurisdictions. All Canadian provinces and territories have implemented mechanisms for the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes within those jurisdictions, and retail models vary between jurisdictions. Provincial/territorial bodies act as intermediaries between entities licensed federally under the Cannabis Act and consumers, such bodies acting in some jurisdictions as exclusive cannabis wholesalers and distributors, and in some instances such bodies acting as exclusive retailers. The laws continue to evolve, and differences in provincial and territorial regulatory frameworks could result in, among other things, increased compliance costs, and increased supply costs.
 Municipal and regional governments may choose to impose additional requirements and regulations on the sale of recreational cannabis, adding further uncertainty and risk to the company’s business. Municipal by-laws may restrict the number of recreational cannabis retail outlets that are permitted in a certain geographical area or restrict the geographical locations wherein such retail outlets may be opened.
 There is no assurance that the provincial, territorial, regional, and municipal regulatory frameworks and distribution models will remain unchanged, or that the Company will be able to navigate such changes in the regulatory frameworks and distribution models or conduct its intended business thereunder. See: “Risk Factors”.
 Ontario: Pursuant to the Cannabis Control Act, 2017 (Ontario), the distribution and retail sale of recreational cannabis is currently conducted through the Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation (“OCRC”), a subsidiary of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. Recreational cannabis has been sold on-line through the OCRC-operated OCS platform, as of October 17, 2018.
 On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis License Act, 2018 (Ontario) became law and other legislation, including the Cannabis Control Act, 2017, the Ontario Cannabis Retail Corporation Act, 2017 and the Liquor Control Act were amended to create a private retail framework for the sale of recreational cannabis in Ontario. As of April 1, 2019, recreational cannabis has been available for sale by private retailers that operate brick-and-mortar stores licensed by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (“AGCO”).
 The recreational cannabis retail regulatory regime in Ontario has the following requirements and features:
  
• | Private retailers are required to obtain both a retail operator license and a retail store authorization. Retail store authorizations are only to be issued to persons holding a retail operator license. Separate retail store authorizations are to be required for each cannabis retail store, but a licensed retail operator may hold more than one retail store authorization and operate multiple stores. Private retailers are not permitted to sell cannabis online but may only sell cannabis in person at an authorized retail store.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The AGCO is the government entity responsible for issuing retail store authorizations for privately run recreational cannabis stores. Until December 13, 2019, a temporary cap of 25 retail store authorizations was imposed while cannabis supply stabilizes. On July 3, 2019, the Government of Ontario announced its plans for a second allocation of 50 additional cannabis retail store authorizations. The AGCO held a lottery draw for the allocation of 42 retail store authorizations. A separate process governed the allocation of eight retail store authorizations for those who wish to operate a store on a First Nations reserve. On March 2, 2020, the restrictions on the total number of store authorizations permitted in Ontario, and their regional distribution, was revoked. The AGCO now accepts applications for retail store authorizations from all interested applicants.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Retail store operators are only permitted to purchase cannabis from the OCRC, which may set a minimum price for cannabis or classes of cannabis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Every authorized cannabis retail store in Ontario must have a licensed retail manager. An individual who supervises employees, oversees cannabis sales, manages compliance or has signing authority to purchase cannabis, enters into contracts or hires employees is required to have a cannabis retail manager license.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal License Holders (and their affiliates) are limited to operating one retail cannabis store in the province, which must be located at the site listed on such producer’s federal license. A broad definition of affiliate is included in the regulations. An affiliate relationship exists if a corporation beneficially owns or controls voting shares, or securities that may be converted to voting shares, constituting more than 25% of voting rights. If a person, or group acting together, holds 50% voting control for the election of directors or market share of the corporation, they are considered affiliates. Additionally, an affiliate relationship may be established through involvement in a trust, partnership, or joint venture, among others. The definition of affiliate may have the effect of restricting the ability of federal License Holders from effectively entering into the consumer retail market in Ontario.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal License Holders are prohibited from providing any material inducement to cannabis retailers for the purpose of increasing the sale of a particular type of cannabis.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Municipalities and reserve band councils were permitted to opt out of the retail cannabis market by resolution. Municipalities had until January 22, 2019 to pass such by-laws, and several municipalities have formally opted-out of the retail market. Municipalities that opted out can later lift the prohibition on retail cannabis stores by subsequent resolution, which cannot be reversed at a later date. Municipalities may not pass bylaws providing for a further system of licensing over the retail sale of cannabis.

 Manitoba: The Government of Manitoba has implemented a ‘‘hybrid model’’ for cannabis distribution, whereby supply is secured and tracked by the Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries Corp.; however, licensed private retail stores are also permitted to sell recreational cannabis.
 Alberta: The Government of Alberta has implemented a cannabis framework providing for the purchase of cannabis products from private retailers that receive their products from a government-regulated distributor, the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission, similar to the distribution system currently in place for alcohol in the province. Only licensed retail outlets are permitted to sell cannabis with online sales run by the AGLC.
 New Brunswick: All recreational cannabis is managed and sold through a network of tightly controlled, stand-alone “Cannabis NB” stores managed by the Cannabis Management Corporation, a subsidiary of New Brunswick Liquor Corporation and is available for sale online through the Cannabis NB platform.
 Quebec: All recreational cannabis is managed and sold by Société québécoise du cannabis (the “SQDC”) outlets and is available for sale online, the entire process controlled by the SQDC.
 Newfoundland and Labrador: Recreational cannabis is sold through private stores, with the crown-owned liquor corporation, the Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corp. (the “NLC”), issuing private retailer licenses and overseeing the distribution to private sellers who may sell to consumers. The NLC also controls the possession, sale, and delivery of cannabis, and sets prices. The NLC is also the online retailer, although licenses may later be issued to private interests.
 Yukon: Yukon had initially limited the distribution and sale of recreational cannabis to government outlets and government-run online stores but has since opened up its retail market to permit licensed private retailers in the territory. Cannabis retail licenses are issued by the Cannabis Licensing Board. Authorized retailers must purchase cannabis from the Yukon Liquor Corporation, acting as the wholesaler and distributor in the territory.
 Northwest Territories: The Northwest Territories Liquor and Cannabis Commission (the “NTLCC”) controls the importation and distribution of cannabis, whether through NTLCC-approved retail outlets or online retail run by the NTLCC. Communities in the Northwest Territories are able to hold a plebiscite to prohibit cannabis, similar to the options currently available to restrict alcohol. 
 British Columbia: Recreational cannabis is sold through both public and licensed privately operated stores, with the provincial Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch handling licensing of private stores and the BCLDB handling wholesale distribution.
 Saskatchewan: The Government of Saskatchewan implemented a framework in which both wholesale and retail recreational cannabis are conducted by the private sector and regulated by the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority. A number of retail permits have been issued to private stores. Beginning in April 2020, SLGA began accepting applications for cannabis retail permits in Saskatchewan communities with populations less than 2,500. In September 2020, SLGA began accepting permit applications for stores in all communities in the province. SLGA is currently accepting applications for wholesale cannabis permits as well as federally licensed producer registrations. Permitted wholesalers can sell to permitted retailers and other permitted wholesalers but not to the

general public. Wholesale operations must be physically located within Saskatchewan and product can only be sold and distributed within Saskatchewan. Further, only federally licensed producers registered with SLGA will be allowed to sell into the Saskatchewan market.
 Nova Scotia: The Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation is responsible for the regulation of cannabis in the province, and recreational cannabis is only sold publicly through government-operated storefronts and online sales.
 Prince Edward Island: Similar to Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island requires cannabis to be sold publicly, through government stores and online, overseen by the Prince Edward Island Cannabis Management Corporation.
 Nunavut: Nunavut allows for the sale of cannabis through both public and private retail and online. In Nunavut, a person can submit an application with the Nunavut Liquor and Cannabis Commission for a license to operate a cannabis store, remote sales store, or cannabis lounge.
 Several of the provinces and territories have been actively working to secure supply agreements from existing federal License Holders. Pure Sunfarms has entered into supply agreements with the OCS, BCLDB, AGLC, MLLC and is in discussions with several other provinces with respect to entering supply agreements. 
 Industrial Hemp
 The new Industrial Hemp Regulations under the Cannabis Act replaced the previous IHR under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (“CDSA”) as of October 17, 2018. The regulatory scheme for industrial hemp production largely remains the same, however the IHR permits the sale of hemp plants to licensed cannabis producers, and licensing requirements under the new IHR are softened in accordance with the lower risk posed by industrial hemp. The IHR defines industrial hemp as a cannabis plant, or any part of that plant, in which the concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) is 0.3 % or less in the flowering heads and leaves.
United States Cannabis Industry and Regulatory Overview
 Village Farms does not maintain any direct or indirect investment in cannabis or cannabis-related products in its U.S. operations, excluding its joint venture Village Fields Hemp USA, LLC, which focuses only on hemp cultivation. The Company targets its efforts on participating in federal and state permissible activities in the U.S. Village Farms does not engage nor intend to engage in direct or indirect business with any business that derives revenue, directly or indirectly, from the sale of cannabis or cannabis-related products in any jurisdiction where the production and sale of cannabis is unlawful under current applicable laws.
 The Company owns and operates four greenhouse facilities in west Texas consisting of nearly six million square feet of production area, where we produce and distribute tomatoes and cucumbers. The Company has proven experience converting its produce greenhouses to cannabis greenhouses, as evidenced by its Pure Sunfarms’ Delta 3 and Delta 2 greenhouses located in British Columbia, Canada. Village Farms is strategically positioned, utilizing decades of agricultural experience coupled with its Pure Sunfarms’ operational and product expertise, to convert its existing greenhouses when legally permitted to do so. 
 As of January 2021, thirty-eight states plus Washington, D.C. passed medical marijuana laws and 15 states plus Washington, D.C. passed recreational laws. Public support for the adult-use legalization of cannabis has increased significantly across the country. Several hundred thousand Americans now work full-time in the cannabis industry and tax revenues associated with the production and sale of cannabis are providing economic benefits in states that have passed legislation. 
 Unlike in Canada, which has uniform federal legislation governing the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis under the Cannabis Act, in the United States, cannabis is regulated at the both the federal and state levels. Notwithstanding the permissive regulatory environment of cannabis in some states, cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act ("CSA"), making it illegal under federal law in the United States to cultivate. distribute, or possess cannabis. This means that while state law in certain U.S. states may take a permissive approach to medical and/or recreational use of cannabis, the CSA may still be enforced by U.S. federal law enforcement officials against citizens and businesses of those states for activity that is legal under state law. As a result of the conflicting views between state legislatures and the U.S. federal government regarding cannabis, investments in cannabis businesses in the United States are subject to inconsistent legislation and regulation.
 Until 2018, the federal government provided guidance to federal agencies and banking institutions through a series of United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) memoranda. The most notable of this guidance came in the form of a memorandum issued by former U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013 (the “Cole Memorandum”). The Cole Memorandum offered guidance to federal agencies on how to prioritize civil enforcement, criminal investigations, and prosecutions regarding marijuana in all states and quickly set a compliance standard for marijuana related businesses. The Cole Memorandum concluded that the Department of Justice should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis. States where medical cannabis had been legalized were not characterized as a high priority. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and 
 8


regulating the sale and use of marijuana will not be repealed or overturned, or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Until the United States Congress amends the CSA with respect to marijuana, there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law.
 On December 20, 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law in the United States. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, defines industrial hemp, removes industrial hemp and CBD derived from industrial hemp, from the CSA and allows for industrial hemp production and sale in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has retained authority over the addition of CBD to products that fall within the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the ''FDCA"). To date, the FDA deems that it is currently illegal to add CBD to a food or beverage, and the FDA does not deem CBD a dietary supplement as the agency cannot conclude that CBD is "generally recognized as safe" among qualified experts for its use in human or animal food. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve CBD as an additive to products under the FDCA.
 Currently, there are three major pieces of cannabis legislation in process, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (“MORE”) Act, the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States (“STATES”) Act and the Secure and Fair Enforcement (“SAFE”) Banking Act. 
 The MORE Act passed the House of Representatives in December 2020. This vote marked the first time in over fifty years that a chamber of Congress addressed ending the federal criminalization of marijuana. The next step for the MORE Act is introduction to the Senate. The MORE Act would deschedule and decrimanlize cannabis at the federal level. The MORE Act would remove marijuana from the list of federally controlled substances, allow states to set their own marijuana policy and establishes a process to expunge convictions and conduct hearings related to prior federal cannabis offenses. The MORE Act also institutes a five percent federal sales tax on all cannabis products and creates a trust that utilizes the tax revenue to support various programs and services in communities impacted by the war on drugs.
 In addition, the MORE Act would impact Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code, which forbids businesses engaged in the trafficking of a Schedule I or II controlled substance from deducting ordinary business expenses to reduce their taxable income. Currently, a cannabis-related business can only deduct cost of goods before taxation, resulting in significantly higher effective tax rates than a non-cannabis business. If cannabis were removed from the Schedule I designation, cannabis-related businesses would be able to deduct employee salaries, rent, marketing, advertising and other selling, general and administrative costs from their operating income.  
 The STATES Act was originally introduced to Congress in 2017 and was re-introduced in 2019. The STATES Act eliminates regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal penalties under the CSA for certain marijuana-related activities that comply with state or tribal law. The STATES Act creates an exemption in the CSA to allow states to determine their own cannabis policies without fear of federal reprisal. The STATES Act does not legalize cannabis on a federal level but aims to protect individuals and companies acting in compliance with state and tribal law.
 The SAFE Banking Act passed the House of Representatives in September 2019 but has not passed the Senate. The SAFE Banking Act is designed to prohibit federal banking regulators from punishing financial institutions from providing services to legitimate cannabis companies, their owners, and employees. In particular, a federal banking regulator cannot terminate or limit deposit insurance, prohibit or penalize a financial institution from providing services to legitimate cannabis-related business or take any adverse or corrective action on a loan made to a legitimate cannabis-related business. 
 Under current federal law, it may be a violation of federal anti-money laundering statutes to take any proceeds from the sale of any Schedule I controlled substance. Financial institutions could potentially be prosecuted and convicted of money laundering under the Bank Secrecy Act for providing services to cannabis businesses. In 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued guidance not to focus enforcement on financial institutions that serve cannabis-related business, as long as the business activities are legal in their state. Thus, most legitimate cannabis-related companies have established relationships with state banks and financial institutions. Also, since these legitimate cannabis firms do not have access to traditional bank financing, they primarily rely on private capital to address their financing needs.
 Since we do not conduct any cannabis-related business in the United States, the SAFE Banking Act would not alter the current financial services for the Company. However, the ability to access public capital for all legitimate cannabis-related companies could provide the industry with additional financing avenues not available today as well as reducing the overall cost of capital.
 Texas Cannabis Industry and Regulatory Overview
 The Texas Legislature meets every two years beginning on the second Tuesday in January and commencing for 140 calendar days. The current session began on January 12, 2021 and will end on May 31, 2021. Texas advocates, lobbyists and some legislators plan to take advantage of the current momentum behind marijuana policy reform in the U.S. and have filed nearly three dozen bills for the current session. The bills reflect similar policy reform presented at the national level, including criminal justice reform and 
 9


decriminalization of marijuana possession, expanding compassionate use programs and repealing marijuana prohibition entirely by legalizing responsible adult use.
 While advocates, lobbyists and policy makers anticipate some form of cannabis reform in the 2021 session, due to the catastrophic freeze and failures of the Texas energy supply, much of the legislative agenda and attention will now be spent on addressing those issues, narrowing the legislative bandwidth to address cannabis reform.  Because of the fast-paced nature of the Texas legislative process, the outcome for cannabis reform during this regular session will be unpredictable and unknowable until late May 2021.
 The legislature only meets every two years, but the governor is likely to call a special session in late 2021 to address redistricting, as the US census information will not be available until fall 2021.  If no meaningful cannabis policy changes occur in the regular session, and especially if reform occurs at the federal level, there is some possibility that the Texas Legislature could be asked to address cannabis reform in this likely special session.
 Our Greenhouse Produce Business
 The Company commenced its produce operations in 1989 and maintains produce operations under both its U.S. subsidiary, Village Farms L.P., and its Canadian subsidiary, Village Farms Canada Limited Partnership. The Company owns and operates four greenhouse facilities in west Texas totaling 130 acres and one produce greenhouse in Delta, British Columbia totaling 60 acres. The Company also represents third party growers (based in Canada and Mexico) on a sales commission basis, which represents approximately 49% of the Company’s 2020 gross produce revenues.
 The Company primarily grows tomatoes at its own facilities and approximately 85% of its 2020 produce sales were tomatoes, 10% peppers, 4% cucumbers and 1% mini-cukes, as compared to 2019 produce sales comprised of 88% tomatoes, 6% peppers, 5% cucumbers and 1% mini-cukes. The Company sells produce predominantly to retailers in the United States and Canada. For 2020 and 2019, roughly 86% and 84% of the Company’s sales were in the United States, respectively, with the top two customers comprising of 27% of produce sales in 2020 and 22% in 2019. Retail direct sales were approximately 76% and 70% of total produce sales for 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the balance to wholesale customers who service small retailers or other markets such as food service.
 While the Company grows in greenhouses as does its supply partners, the production of produce is always lower in the winter months as compared to the summer months. As such, the produce business has seasonality to its produce sales. Historically, the Company has had higher sales in its second and third quarters and lower sales, due to lower volumes, in the first and fourth quarters.
 The produce business is very competitive and while the Company has some primary large commercial competitors, there is an abundance of growers as discussed in the Greenhouse Vegetable Industry Overview, which has resulted in an oversupplied market resulting in our retail customers continually pressing for price reductions. Due to the perishable nature of the produce business, pricing is very sensitive to the daily demand versus supply in each produce category, with the Company’s primary category being tomatoes. We try to combat the commoditization of the tomato category by offering unique tomatoes such as the Heavenly Villagio Marzano® and Sinfully Sweet Campari® as a means of distinguishing Village Farms to our retail customers but the large tomato varieties such as tomatoes on the vine (“TOVs”) and beefsteak are still a predominant part of the Company’s produce business and industry sales. Our produce business has limited trademark or brand loyalty.
 Greenhouse Vegetable Industry Overview
 (A) The North American Industry
 The greenhouse vegetable industry in North America has experienced rapid growth over the past 20 years, particularly in the western regions of the United States, southwest British Columbia and southern Ontario in Canada, and concentrated areas in Mexico.
 Mexico is the largest producer of greenhouse tomatoes, accounting for 57% of North American greenhouse vegetable sales, followed by Canada and the United States. Based on figures from 2016, greenhouse tomatoes accounted for over 45% tomato volume sold at retail stores in the United States. It is estimated that retail sales represent over 50% of the total fresh tomato market, including both field and hothouse grown. The balance of fresh tomato sales is to the food service industry, which is primarily serviced by field tomato producers.
 The following table illustrates estimated greenhouse tomato area and production for the U.S., Mexico, and Canada in 2016 (the most recent date for which this information is available):
 10



 
Item | United States | | Canada | | Mexico1 | Total North America
--------------------------------------------------+---------------+-----+--------+-----+---------+--------------------
Greenhouse tomato production (millions of pounds) | | 645 | | 609 | | 2,400 | 3,654 
Greenhouse tomato area (hectares) | | 680 | | 591 | | 14,000 | 15,271

 (B) Greenhouse Industry — United States
 The majority of greenhouse vegetable producers in the United States are located in the southwestern and western states, where the growing conditions are more ideal for winter growing operations and the possibility of year-round production. New greenhouse facilities have recently been completed and more are planned. These facilities have lights to allow for production in the winter months. Producing in the winter months is advantageous as produce prices are generally higher, although with increasing Mexican production, seasonal fluctuations are gradually decreasing over time. The majority of greenhouse tomatoes produced in
 the United States are used for domestic consumption, and producers in the United States benefit from high yields, consistent product quality, year-round supply, and closer proximity to its customers. In order to meet domestic demand, the United States imports a significant portion of its supply of greenhouse tomatoes from Canada and Mexico. It is estimated that Mexican greenhouse vegetables comprise between 50% to 60% of consumption in the United States. 
 In addition, many U.S. growers of labor-intensive crops rely on immigrant workers from countries such as Mexico. The demand for farm labor in the U.S. continues to grow while the labor supply remains constant or slightly decreasing, leading to rising wages and benefits. U.S. employers may utilize H-2A workers to assist in fulfilling their labor needs. Section 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the lawful admission into the United States of temporary, nonimmigrant workers (H-2A workers) to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature. The H-2A has additional costs to the greenhouse grower as the H-2A program has set state-level minimum wages and growers must pay for some worker expenses, such as transportation costs and housing. 
 (C) Greenhouse Industry — Canada
 Among the North American greenhouse vegetable producers, Canada is the largest supplier from April to October of each year. Several factors, including climatic advantages (cooler summer temperatures) and the proximity of greenhouse producers to consumer markets, contribute to Canada’s favorable positioning relative to the United States during that time period. The primary markets for greenhouse produce grown in British Columbia include the west and northwest regions of the United States, as well as western Canada, while the primary markets for Ontario produce include the east and central regions of the United States, as well as eastern Canada.
 The strengths of the Canadian greenhouse vegetable industry include its high yields and consistent product quality. The main weakness of the Canadian greenhouse industry relates to its lack of production during the historically higher priced winter months. However, because of the high volume of tomatoes produced in Canada during the April to October growing season, profits generated during this time period generally are sufficient to sustain producers through the full year.
 (D) Greenhouse Industry — Mexico
 Although Mexico was the last country to enter the greenhouse tomato industry in North America, it has more greenhouse tomato acreage than the United States and Canada combined. It should be noted there is no formal definition of a “greenhouse” and a significant portion of the greenhouse acreage in Mexico is very low-tech, shade field structures. The product from the shade facilities is in some instances marketed as greenhouse-grown, which until the recent update on the Suspension Agreement between the United States and Mexico, was not in violation of any regulations, but for the State of California, which has a strict definition of greenhouse-grown for produce sold within the state. Average yields and product quality in Mexico are comparatively low, as compared to U.S. and Canadian greenhouse operations. Currently, Mexican producers tend to grow a majority of their production during the fall, winter, and spring seasons as they have sufficient light levels to grow and cooler temperatures during these months, although the trend towards more sophisticated greenhouses is permitting a longer growing season as well as increased yields.
 Over the last several years, the greenhouse industry in Mexico has continued to make significant advances with respect to its growing expertise and ability to extend its growing season, which continues to put pressure on produce pricing. Mexican growers are continuing to invest in greenhouses and other technology to improve production and yields. As the greenhouse industry is a labor-
 11


intensive business, the labor costs are a significant portion of overhead. Mexico has a considerable wage advantage versus the U.S. due primarily to the lower cost of living in Mexico. Mexico’s minimum wage is 141.70 Mexican pesos a day or approximately US$7.10 per day as compared to the U.S. Federal minimum wage of US$7.25 per hour.
 Pricing
 Prices for vegetables fluctuate depending upon availability of supply and consumer demand. Greenhouse vegetable producers typically command a higher price for their products compared to field producers, as a result of the vegetables’ consistent quality, taste, appearance, and year-round availability. This higher price, combined with higher production yields for greenhouse produce, typically offset the higher costs associated with greenhouse production relative to field production. Production costs for greenhouse-grown produce are generally higher due to greater energy, labor, infrastructure, technological requirements, and more intense crop yields per acre. As the fresh produce market share of big box retailers increases, pricing is moving towards more contract pricing for six, nine or even twelve-month periods reducing some of the fluctuations with traditional seasonal pricing. However, contract pricing does not provide volume guarantees. 
 Pricing in 2020 increased for the period from April through October as compared to previous years, most likely due to a shortfall in supply due to customer buying habits related to COVID-19. However, starting in November 2020, the supply of greenhouse vegetables met customer demand causing prices to decrease towards a more normalized range. In general, the average pricing in the last five years has continued to decline due to the increasing supply of greenhouse tomatoes. This price decrease is expected to continue, as new greenhouse acreage for commodity items continues to expand, enabling greenhouse growers to provide additional capacity of high-quality vegetables.
 Our U.S. Hemp Business
 The Company entered the U.S. Hemp business in the spring of 2019 after the passing of the 2018 Farm Bill. As Village Farms was not experienced in outdoor field growing, the Company created two U.S. based joint ventures – Village Fields Hemp, Inc. (“VFH” or “VF Hemp”), in which it owns 65% and Arkansas Valley Green and Gold Hemp (“AVGGH”), in which it owns 60%, with 5% owned by VFH. The remaining interests in both U.S. hemp joint ventures were partners who had experience in outdoor growing of hemp (VFH) and cannabis (AVGGH). Additionally, the Company commenced conversion of a portion of one of its Texas greenhouse facilities in anticipation of the State of Texas approving hemp cultivation within the state of Texas. The State of Texas approved the production, manufacture and retail sale of hemp crops and products in June 2019. 
 The initial crop results from VFH were encouraging. VFH contracted with over 50 independent farmers to grow hemp on a results basis producing over 800,000 pounds of hemp biomass. AVGGH lost its initial crop after harvesting in October 2019 due to a windstorm, as hemp grown in Colorado is dried in the field. Subsequently, we wrote off the balance of our investment in AVGGH.
 During the Company’s hemp joint venture’s cultivation activities, the FDA announced that CBD, the primary by-product from hemp, was deemed to be a prescription drug and would require further science-based studies on its safety. As such, the FDA has concluded that for the time being, CBD cannot be added to foods, drugs, cosmetics, or dietary supplements unless the product is specifically approved by the FDA, which is an expensive and time-consuming process. Primarily due to the FDA’s position on the safe consumption of CBD, sales of hemp biomass have been very slow. Due to the current market environment, our U.S. Hemp business is in a holding pattern at this time and is limiting its activities to selling the harvested 2019 VFH biomass. In the instance the FDA adjusts its position on CBD, the Company may commence hemp operations if the Company deems there is a sufficient market demand for CBD products.

Currently, the Company matches a portion of eligible employee contributions.
 In Texas, Village Farms utilizes private insurance to provide benefits to employees in the event of a work-related injury or occupational disease in lieu of workers’ compensation insurance. All employees outside of Texas are covered under our Workers’ Compensation policy, which also covers accidental injuries or illness which occur during working hours or conditions caused by work activities. Both our private insurance and Workers’ Compensation are paid by the Company.  This insurance provides for the payment of medical expenses and weekly compensation payments during the period of an employee's work-related injury or illness. The Company has a long-standing philosophy of taking pride in its practices to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of our employees. To ensure a safe and healthful workplace environment, the Company has established a program that serves to outline our commitment to this philosophy and the Company provides guidance to all employees on the standards for compliance. 
 In response to COVID-19, we implemented, and continue to improve, appropriate safety programs and protocols to help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees. We took proactive actions early on to protect the health of our employees and their families, including curtailing business travel and encouraging video conferencing whenever possible. We initiated protocols including the option to work from home when feasible, proper hygiene, social distancing, mask use and temperature screenings and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies. While we believe we have responded appropriately to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the situation evolves, we will continue to analyze additional mitigation measures that may be needed to preserve the health and safety of our workforce, our customers and the ongoing continuity of our business operations. Those measures might include modifying workspaces, continuing social distancing policies, implementing new personal protective equipment or health screening policies at our facilities, or such other industry best practices needed to continue to maintain a healthy and safe environment for our employees amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Social Responsibility
 Village Farms has stood by its core Good for the Earth principles since the Company’s inception over 30 years ago. Since its inception, Village Farms is guided by a Sustainable Agriculture Policy, which integrates three main goals, environmental health, economic profitability, and social and economic equality. The Company’s greenhouse growing is the environmentally sustainable future of farming in its ability to preserve natural resources, such as reduced water usage while growing more on less land.  In controlled environment agriculture, soil erosion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions are largely neutralized.  In addition, Village Farms’ investments in the latest technological advancements, and its ability to produce higher yields per square meter, mean there is more health and wellness
 products grown with little impact to the environment. The Company’s clean energy facility converts methane gas from a nearby landfill to energy sources that are utilized in its greenhouses in Canada. The Company’s greenhouses rely 
 13


on, and have successfully employed, non-chemical methods for pest control known as Integrated Pest Management, whereas beneficial insects largely alleviate the need for pesticides. 
 Pure Sunfarms’ greenhouses also installed blackout curtains to reduce energy consumption and mitigate light pollution for the greater Vancouver area. At all greenhouse facilities, Village Farms sterilizes and recirculates water numerous times with no waste, and in Texas, discharged water is used to irrigate an adjacent track of land where a local farmer is then able to graze his cattle year-round. Our greenhouses utilize reusable coconut fiber, not soil, to support the plants in a hydroponic solution, so there is no soil erosion or loss of precious nutrients. 
 The Company has memberships in core industry associations such as the United Fresh Produce Association and the Produce Marketing Association, where leaders explore strategies and provide solutions to expand fresh produce consumption and strive to feed a growing world population. Village Farms continues to contribute and distribute fresh produce to help feed those in need, as well as champion volunteer efforts in national food banks, such as Feeding America. Donation efforts to food banks and food pantries are also localized in all the regions where company offices and facilities are located. On a community level, local involvement in organizations such as the Canadian Cancer Society, American Lung Association, Rotary clubs, hospitals, and community art outreach activities, are just some of the diverse charitable contributions the company supports.
