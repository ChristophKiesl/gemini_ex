ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
General Development of Business

Monitronics International, Inc. ("Monitronics") and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company" or "Brinks Home SecurityTM", "we", "us", and "our"), were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ascent Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascent Capital") until August 30, 2019.  
On December 17, 2010, Ascent Capital acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Monitronics through the merger of Mono Lake Merger Sub, Inc., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Ascent Capital established to consummate the merger, with and into Monitronics, with Monitronics as the surviving corporation in the merger.  We were incorporated in the state of Texas on August 31, 1994.
On February 26, 2018, we entered into an exclusive, long-term, trademark licensing agreement with The Brink’s Company ("Brink's"), which resulted in a complete rebranding of Monitronics and its subsidiary, LiveWatch as Brinks Home Security (the "Brink's License Agreement"). The rollout of the Brinks Home Security brand in the second quarter of 2018 included the integration of our business model under a single brand. As part of the integration, we reorganized our business from two reportable segments, "MONI" and "LiveWatch," to one reportable segment, Brinks Home Security.
On June 30, 2019, Monitronics and certain of its domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the "Debtors"), filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the "Petitions" and, the cases commenced thereby, the "Chapter 11 Cases") under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the "Bankruptcy Court"). The Debtors' Chapter 11 Cases were jointly administered under the caption In re Monitronics International, Inc., et al., Case No. 19-33650. On August 7, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, Docket No. 199 (the "Confirmation Order"), confirming and approving the Debtors' Joint Partial Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization (including all exhibits thereto and, as modified by the Confirmation order, the "Plan") that was previously filed with the Bankruptcy Court on June 30, 2019. On August 30, 2019 (the "Effective Date"), the conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied and the Company emerged from Chapter 11 after completing a series of transactions through which the Company and its former parent, Ascent Capital, merged (the "Merger") in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 24, 2019 (the "Merger Agreement"). Monitronics was the surviving corporation and, immediately following the Merger, was redomiciled in Delaware in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Brinks Home Security provides residential customers and commercial client accounts with monitored home and business security systems, as well as interactive and home automation services, in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Brinks Home Security customers are obtained through our direct-to-consumer sales channel (the "Direct to Consumer Channel") or our exclusive authorized dealer network (the "Dealer Channel"), which provides product and installation services, as well as support to customers. Our Direct to Consumer Channel offers both Do-It-Yourself ("DIY") and professional installation security solutions.

Narrative Description of Business

Monitronics International, Inc., a Delaware corporation, does business as Brinks Home Security and provides residential customers and commercial client accounts with monitored home and business security systems, as well as interactive and home automation services, in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Our principal executive office is located at 1990 Wittington Place, Farmers Branch, Texas, telephone number (972) 243-7443.
Brinks Home Security
We are one of the largest security alarm monitoring companies in North America, with customers under contract in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada. We offer:

• | monitoring services for alarm signals arising from burglaries, fires, medical alerts and other events through security systems at our customers' premises;


• | a comprehensive platform of home automation services, including, among other things, remote activation and control of security systems, support for video monitoring, flood sensors, automated garage door and door lock capabilities and thermostat integration;


• | hands-free two-way interactive voice communication between our monitoring center and our customers; and


• | customer service and technical support related to home monitoring systems and home automation services.

Our business model consists of two principal sales channels consisting of customers sourced through our Dealer Channel and our Direct to Consumer Channel, the latter of which sources customers through direct-to-consumer advertising primarily through internet, print and partnership program marketing activities.
Our Dealer Channel, which we consider exclusive based on our right of first refusal with respect to any accounts generated by such dealers, is our largest source of customers, representing 77% of gross additional customers during the year ended December 31, 2019, when excluding negotiated account acquisitions in the period. Outsourcing a portion of the low margin, high fixed-cost elements of our business to a large network of dealers allows flexibility in managing our cost structure.
Our Direct to Consumer Channel is an important element of our channel diversity strategy. Our Direct to Consumer Channel accounted for 23% of our gross additional customers during the year ended December 31, 2019, when excluding bulk account purchases in the period. Our Direct to Consumer Channel provides customers with both a DIY installation option and a professional installation option. Our DIY offering provides an asset-light, geographically-unconstrained product. In contrast to our Dealer Channel with local market presence, our Direct to Consumer Channel generates accounts through leads from direct response marketing. The Direct to Consumer Channel, including DIY, is expected to lower creation costs per account acquired as this sales channel matures.
We generate nearly all of our revenue from fees charged to customers (or "subscribers") under alarm monitoring agreements ("AMAs"), which include access to interactive and automation features at a higher fee. Additional revenue is also generated as our customers bundle other interactive services with their traditional monitoring services. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 95% of new customers purchased at least one of our interactive services alongside traditional security monitoring services. As of December 31, 2019, we had 847,758 subscribers generating $38,300,000 of Recurring Monthly Revenue ("RMR").
We generate incremental revenue through product and installation sales or by providing additional services, such as maintenance and wholesale contract monitoring. Contract monitoring includes fees charged to other security alarm companies for monitoring their accounts on a wholesale basis. As of December 31, 2019, we provided wholesale monitoring services for approximately 52,000 accounts. The incremental revenue streams do not represent a significant portion of our overall revenue.
Sales and Marketing
Management markets the Brinks Home Security brand directly to consumers through internet, television, radio and print national advertising campaigns and partnerships with other subscription or member-based organizations and businesses. This, coupled with our authorized dealer nationwide network, is an effective way for us to market alarm systems. Locally-based dealers are often an integral part of the communities they serve and understand the local market and how best to satisfy local needs. By combining the dealer's local presence and reputation with the nationally marketed Brinks Home Security brand, accompanied with our high quality service and support, we are able to satisfy our customer's needs in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Dealer Channel
Our Dealer Channel consists of approximately 200 independent dealers who are typically small businesses that sell and install alarm systems. These dealers generally do not retain the AMAs due to the scale and large upfront investment required to build and efficiently operate monitoring stations and the related infrastructure. These dealers typically sell the AMAs to third parties and outsource the monitoring function for any AMAs they retain. The initial contract term for contracts generated by the dealers are typically three years, with automatic renewals annually or on a month-to-month basis depending on state and local regulations. We have the ability to monitor signals from nearly all types of residential security systems.
We generally enter into exclusive contracts with dealers that typically have initial terms ranging between two to five years, with renewal terms thereafter. In order to maximize revenue and geographic diversification, we partner with dealers from throughout the U.S. We believe our ability to maximize return on invested capital is largely dependent on the quality of our dealers and the accounts acquired. Rigorous underwriting standards are applied to, and a detailed review is conducted of, each AMA to be acquired.

We generally acquire each new AMA at a cost based on a multiple of the account's RMR. The dealer contracts generally provide that if an acquired AMA is terminated within the first 12 months, the dealer must replace the AMA or refund the AMA purchase price. To secure the dealer's obligation, we typically retain a percentage of the AMA purchase price.
Customer Integration and Marketing

Dealers in our Dealer Channel typically introduce customers to us when describing our central monitoring station. Following the acquisition of an AMA from a dealer, the customer is notified that we are responsible for all their monitoring and customer service needs. The customer's awareness and identification of our brand as the monitoring service provider is further supported by the distribution of branded materials by the dealer to the customer at the point of sale, as discussed in "Dealer Marketing Support" below. 
Dealer Network Development

We remain focused on expanding our network of independent authorized dealers. To do so, we have established a dealer program that provides participating dealers with a variety of support services to assist them as they grow their businesses. Authorized dealers may use the Brinks Home Security brand name in their sales and marketing activities and on the products they sell and install. Authorized dealers benefit from their affiliation with us and our national reputation for high customer satisfaction, as well as the support they receive from us. Authorized dealers also have the opportunity to obtain discounts on alarm systems and other equipment purchased by such dealers from original equipment manufacturers. We also make available sales, business and technical training, sales literature, co-branded marketing materials, sales leads and management support to our authorized dealers.  In most cases, these services and cost savings would not be available to security alarm dealers on an individual basis.
Currently, we employ sales representatives to promote our authorized dealer program, find account acquisition opportunities and sell our monitoring services. We target independent alarm dealers across the U.S. that can benefit from our dealer program services and can generate high quality monitoring customers for us. We use a variety of marketing techniques to promote the dealer program and related services. These activities include direct mail, trade magazine advertising, trade shows, internet web site marketing, publicity and telemarketing.
Dealer Marketing Support
We offer our authorized dealers a marketing support program that is focused on developing professionally designed sales and marketing materials that will help dealers market alarm systems and monitoring services with maximum effectiveness. All materials provided to our authorized dealers focus on the Brinks Home Security brand and our role as the single source of support for the customer. Materials offered to authorized dealers include:

• | sales brochures and flyers;


• | yard signs;


• | window decals;


• | customer forms and agreements;


• | sales presentation binders;


• | door hangers;


• | vehicle graphics;

5


• | trade show booths; and


• | clothing bearing the Brinks Home Security brand name.

These materials are made available to dealers at prices that our management believes would not be available to dealers on an individual basis.
Sales materials used by authorized dealers promote both the Brinks Home Security brand and the dealer's status as a Brinks Home Security authorized dealer. Dealers often sell and install alarm systems which display the Brinks Home Security logo and telephone number, which further strengthens consumer recognition of their status as Brinks Home Security authorized dealers. Management believes that the dealers' use of our brand to promote their affiliation with one of the nation's largest alarm monitoring companies boosts the dealers' credibility and reputation in their local markets and also assists in supporting their sales success.
Negotiated Account Acquisitions

In addition to the development of our Dealer Channel, we periodically acquire alarm monitoring accounts from other alarm companies in bulk on a negotiated basis. Our management has extensive experience in identifying potential opportunities, negotiating account acquisitions and performing thorough due diligence, which helps facilitate execution of new acquisitions in a timely manner.
Direct to Consumer Channel
Through the Direct to Consumer Channel, we offer professionally installed or DIY home security and automation solutions coupled with alarm monitoring security services. The Direct to Consumer Channel obtains subscribers through e-commerce online sales and through a trained inside sales phone operation. We sell the equipment and installation services, if applicable, up-front to new customers with a low monthly rate for monitoring services. In addition, we offer third party financing to qualifying customers for the up-front equipment and installation charges. Contract terms for AMAs originated through the Direct to Consumer Channel can vary depending on packages selected, with the current standard offering being a three year contract.
When a customer initiates and completes the sales process to obtain alarm monitoring services, including signing an AMA, we pre-configure the alarm monitoring system based on the customer's specifications, then package and ship the equipment directly to the customer. The customer has the option to self-install the equipment or have a professional installation. The customer activates the monitoring service with our central station over the phone. 
Customer Operations
Once a customer has contracted for services, we provide 24-hour monitoring services through our alarm monitoring center as well as billing and 24-hour technical support through our customer care center, located in Farmers Branch, Texas. Our alarm monitoring center has received the Monitoring Association's prestigious Five Diamond certification. Five Diamond certification is achieved by having all alarm monitoring operators complete special industry training and pass an exam.
We have a back-up facility in Dallas, Texas that is capable of supporting monitoring and certain customer service operations in the event of a disruption at our primary alarm monitoring and customer care center.
Our telephone systems utilize high-capacity, high-quality, digital circuits backed up by conventional telephone lines. When an alarm signal is received at the monitoring facility, it is routed to an operator. At the same time, information concerning the subscriber whose alarm has been activated and the nature and location of the alarm signal is delivered to the operator's computer terminal. The operator is then responsible for following standard procedures to contact the subscriber or take other appropriate action, including, if the situation requires, contacting local emergency service providers. We never dispatch our own personnel to the subscriber's premises in response to an alarm event. If a subscriber lives in an area where the emergency service provider will not respond without verification of an actual emergency, we will contract with an independent third party responder if available in that area.
Security system interactive and home automation services are contracted with and provided by various third party technology companies to the subscriber.
We seek to increase subscriber satisfaction and retention by carefully managing customer and technical service. The customer care center handles all general inquiries from all subscribers, including those related to subscriber information changes, basic 
6

alarm troubleshooting, alarm verification, technical service requests and requests to enhance existing services. We have a proprietary centralized information system that enables us to satisfy a substantial amount of subscriber technical inquiries over the telephone, without dispatching a service technician. If the customer requires field service, we rely on our nationwide network of independent service dealers and over 90 employee field service technicians to provide such service. We closely monitor service dealer performance with customer satisfaction forms, follow-up quality assurance calls and other performance metrics. In 2019, we dispatched approximately 255 independent service dealers around the country to handle our field service.
Customers
We believe that our subscriber acquisition process, which includes both clearly defined customer account standards and a comprehensive due diligence process focusing on both the dealers and the AMAs to be acquired, contributes significantly to the high quality of our subscriber base. For each of the last five calendar years, the average credit score associated with AMAs that were acquired was 710 or higher on the FICO scale.
Approximately 93% of our subscribers are residential homeowners and the remainder are small commercial accounts. We believe that by focusing on residential homeowners, rather than renters, we can reduce attrition, because homeowners relocate less frequently than renters.
Intellectual Property

Pursuant to the terms of the Brink's License Agreement, Monitronics has exclusive use of the Brinks and Brinks Home Security trademarks related to the residential smart home and home security categories in the U.S. and Canada. The Brink's License Agreement provides for an initial term of seven years and, subject to certain conditions, allows for subsequent renewal periods whereby Monitronics can extend the agreement beyond 20 years. We also own certain proprietary software applications that are used to provide services to our dealers and subscribers, including various trademarks and patents, which causes a predetermined group of recipients to receive a text message automatically once an alarm is triggered. Other than as mentioned above, we do not hold any patents or other intellectual property rights on our proprietary software applications.
Strategy
Our goal is to maximize return on invested capital, which we believe may be achieved by pursuing the following strategies:
Capitalize on Limited Market Penetration
We seek to capitalize on what we view as the current limited market penetration in security services and grow our existing customer base through the following initiatives:

• | continue to develop our dealer position in the market to drive acquisitions of high-quality AMAs;


• | leverage our Direct to Consumer Channel to competitively secure new customers;


• | increase home integration, automation and ancillary product offerings; and


• | continue to monitor potential bulk account purchases and accretive merger and acquisition opportunities.

Proactively Manage Customer Attrition
Customer attrition has historically been reasonably predictable and we regularly identify and monitor the principal drivers thereof, including our customers' credit scores and contract expiration dates, which we believe are the strongest predictors of retention. We seek to maximize customer retention by consistently offering high quality automated home monitoring services and increasing the average life of acquired AMAs through the following initiatives:

• | maintain the high quality of our customer base by continuing to implement our highly disciplined AMA acquisition program;


• | continue to motivate our dealers to obtain only high-quality accounts through incentives built into purchase multiples and by having a performance guarantee on substantially all dealer originated accounts;


• | prioritize the inclusion of interactive and home automation services in the AMAs we purchase, which we believe increases customer retention;


• | proactively identifying customers "at-risk" for attrition through new technology initiatives;


• | improve customer care and first call resolution;

7


• | continue to implement initiatives to reduce core attrition, which include more effective initial on-boarding of customers, conducting customer surveys at key touchpoints and competitive retention offers for departing customers; and


• | utilize available customer data to actively identify customers who are relocating and target retention of such customers.

Maximize Economics of Business Model

We seek to optimize the rate of return on investment by scaling our operational costs against our recurring revenue streams and managing subscriber acquisition costs, or the costs of acquiring an account ("Subscriber Acquisition Costs"). Subscriber Acquisition Costs, whether capitalized or expensed, include the direct costs related to the Direct to Consumer Channel, the acquisition costs to acquire AMAs from the Dealer Channel and certain sales and marketing costs. We consistently offer what we view as competitive rates for account acquisition. We believe our cash flows may also benefit from our continued efforts to decrease our cost to serve by investing in customer service automation and targeting cost saving initiatives.  For a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Grow Dealer Channel
We plan to expand AMA acquisitions by targeting new dealers from whom we expect to generate high quality customers. We believe that by providing dealers with a full range of services designed to assist them in all aspects of their business, including sales leads, sales training, technical training, comprehensive on-line account access, detailed weekly account summaries, sales support materials and discounts on security system hardware purchased through our strategic alliances with security system manufacturers, we are able to attract and partner with dealers that will succeed in our existing dealer network.
For a description of the risks associated with the foregoing strategies, and with the Company's business in general, see "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS."
Seasonality
Our business experiences a certain level of seasonality. Because more household moves take place during the second and third calendar quarters of each year, our disconnect rate and new customer additions may be higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters. In addition, we may see increased servicing costs related to higher alarm signals and customer service requests as a result of customer power outages and other issues due to weather-related incidents.
Industry; Competition

The security alarm industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Our competitors include other major security alarm companies with nationwide coverage, numerous smaller providers with regional or local coverage and certain large multi-service organizations that operate in multiple industries, including the technology, telecommunications and cable businesses. Our significant competitors for obtaining subscriber AMAs include:

• | ADT, Inc. ("ADT");


• | Vivint Smart Home, Inc.;


• | Guardian Protection Services, Inc.;


• | Vector Security, Inc.;


• | Comcast Corporation;


• | SimpliSafe, Inc.; and


• | Ring LLC.

Competition in the security alarm industry is based primarily on reputation for quality of service, market visibility, services offered, brand recognition, price and the ability to identify and obtain customer accounts. Competition for customers has also increased in recent years with the emergence of DIY home security providers and other technology companies expanding into the security alarm industry. We believe we compete effectively with our competitors due to our reputation for reliable monitoring, customer and technical services, the quality of our services and our relatively lower cost structure. We believe the dynamics of the security alarm industry favor larger alarm monitoring companies, such as Brinks Home Security, with a nationwide focus that have greater resources and benefit from economies of scale in technology, advertising and other expenditures.
8

Some of these security alarm companies have also adopted, in whole or in part, a dealer program similar to ours. In these instances, we must also compete with these programs in recruiting dealers. We believe we compete effectively with other dealer programs due to the quality of our dealer support services and our competitive acquisition terms. Our significant competitors for recruiting dealers include:

• | ADT;


• | Guardian Protection Services, Inc.; and


• | Vector Security, Inc.

Regulatory Matters

Our operations are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and licensing requirements of federal, state and local authorities including federal and state customer protection laws. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards in the conduct of our business. The security industry is also subject to requirements imposed by various insurance, approval, listing and standards organizations. Depending upon the type of subscriber served, the type of security service provided and the requirements of the applicable local governmental jurisdiction, adherence to the requirements and standards of such organizations is mandatory in some instances and voluntary in others.
Although local governments routinely respond to panic and smoke/fire alarms, there are an increasing number of local governmental authorities that have adopted or are considering various measures aimed at reducing the number of false burglar alarms. Such measures include:

• | subjecting alarm monitoring companies to fines or penalties for false alarms;


• | imposing fines on alarm subscribers for false alarms;


• | imposing limitations on the number of times the police will respond to false alarms at a particular location;


• | requiring additional verification of intrusion alarms by calling two different phone numbers prior to dispatch ("Enhanced Call Verification"); and


• | requiring visual verification of an actual emergency at the premises before the police will respond to an alarm signal.

Enhanced Call Verification has been implemented as standard policy by us.
Security alarm systems monitored by us utilize telephone lines, internet connections, cellular networks and radio frequencies to transmit alarm signals. The cost of telephone lines and the type of equipment that may be used in telephone line transmissions, are currently regulated by both federal and state governments. The operation and utilization of cellular and radio frequencies are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission and state public utility commissions.
For additional information on the regulatory framework in which we operate, please see "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Factors Relating to Regulatory Matters."

Employees

As of December 31, 2019, we had over 1,085 full-time employees and over 15 part-time employees, all of which are located in the U.S.
