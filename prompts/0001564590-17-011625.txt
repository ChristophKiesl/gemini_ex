ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 Eagle Materials Inc., through its subsidiaries, (the “Company” or “EXP” which may be referred to as “we”, “our” or “us”) is a leading supplier of construction products, building materials, and materials used for oil and natural gas extraction in the United States.  Our construction products are used in residential, industrial, commercial and infrastructure construction and include cement, slag, concrete and aggregates.  Our building materials are sold into similar markets and include gypsum wallboard.  Our basic materials used for oil and natural gas extraction include frac sand and oil well cement. Our products are commodities that are essential in commercial and residential construction, public construction projects, projects to build, expand and repair roads and highways and in natural gas and oil extraction. Demand for these products is generally cyclical and seasonal, depending on economic and geographic conditions. Our operations are geographically diverse, providing us with regional economic diversification. 
 The Company was founded in 1963 as a building materials subsidiary of Centex Corporation (“Centex”), and we operated as a public company under the name Centex Construction Products, Inc. from April 1994 to January 30, 2004, at which time Centex completed a tax-free distribution of its shares to its shareholders and the company was renamed Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE – EXP).
 Our goal, through continuous improvement, is to be the lowest cost producer in each of the markets in which we compete. As such, we will continue to focus on reducing costs and improving our operations, recognizing that being a low-cost producer is a key to our success. 
 We also continue to focus on growth through acquisitions and the organic development of our asset network, in ways that align with our return on investment profitability objectives. We have completed the following acquisitions during the past two years:
 On February 10, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of the following assets (the “Fairborn Acquisition”) of CEMEX Construction Materials Atlantic LLC (“the Seller”) (i) a cement plant located in Fairborn, Ohio, (ii) a cement distribution terminal located in Columbus, Ohio, and (iii) certain other properties and assets used by the Seller in connection with the foregoing (collectively, the “Fairborn Business”).  The purchase price (the “Fairborn Purchase Price”) in the Fairborn Acquisition was approximately $400.5 million.  In addition, the Company assumed certain liabilities and obligations of the Seller relating to the Fairborn Business, including contractual obligations, reclamation obligations and various other liabilities and obligations arising out of or relating to the Fairborn Business. The Company funded the payment of the Fairborn Purchase Price and expenses incurred in connection with the Fairborn Acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s existing bank credit facility. The result of operations for the Fairborn Business are included in our operating results from February 10, 2017 to March 31, 2017.
 On July 10, 2015, we completed the acquisition of a 0.6 million ton per year Granulated Ground Blast Furnace Slag (“Slag”) plant in South Chicago (the “Skyway Plant”) from Holcim (US) Inc. (the “Skyway Acquisition”).  Among other applications, Slag is used in conjunction with Portland cement to make a lower permeability concrete.  The Skyway Plant purchases its primary raw material, slag, pursuant to a long-term supply agreement with a third party.  The purchase price (the “Skyway Purchase Price”) for the Skyway Acquisition was approximately $29.9 million, net of $2.5 million which was refunded in two installments in January 2016 and 2017. We funded the payment of the Skyway Purchase Price and expenses incurred in connection with the Skyway Acquisition with operating cash flow. We also assumed certain liabilities, including contractual obligations, related to the Skyway Plant.

  Industry Segment Information 
 Our operations are organized into five segments: Cement, Concrete and Aggregates, Gypsum Wallboard, Recycled Paperboard and Oil and Gas Proppants.  Although we have five segments, we participate in three businesses.  Our Cement and Concrete and Aggregates segments participate in the construction products sector, our Gypsum Wallboard and Recycled Paperboard segments participate in the building materials sector and our Oil and Gas Proppants segment participates in the oil and gas exploration sector. A further description of these business segments can be found on pages 3-19.
 We operate seven cement plants (one of which belongs to our joint venture company), one slag grinding facility and seventeen cement distribution terminals.  Our 5.2 million tons of clinker capacity is approximately 5% of total U.S. clinker capacity.  Our cement companies focus on the U.S. heartland in Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Ohio and Nevada, as well as the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area.  Our joint venture also owns a minority interest in an import terminal in Houston, Texas and can purchase up to 495,000 short tons annually from this cement terminal.  Slag is ground in the greater Chicago, Illinois area and sold primarily in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, Minnesota, Missouri and Kansas. 
  We have three concrete and aggregates businesses, which consist of seventeen concrete batching plants and four aggregates facilities.  The concrete and aggregates business is more local in their operations, and serve the areas immediately surrounding Austin, Texas, the greater Kansas City area and north of Sacramento, California.  Demand for cement, concrete and aggregates may fluctuate more widely because local and regional markets and economies can be more sensitive to changes than the national market, as well as being more susceptible to seasonal impact due to adverse weather.  
 We operate five gypsum wallboard plants, including one plant, in Bernalillo, New Mexico, that has been idled since 2009.  Gypsum wallboard is distributed throughout the U.S. with particular emphasis in the geographic markets nearest to our production facilities, which are in Albuquerque and Bernalillo, New Mexico; Gypsum, Colorado; Duke, Oklahoma; and Georgetown, South Carolina. We are planning to restart our Bernalillo plant during fiscal 2018, and anticipate running this plant as necessary to meet customer demand. We also operate a recycled paperboard business which sells internally to our wallboard business as well as to external customers.  Our paperboard plant is located in Lawton, Oklahoma. Our gypsum wallboard and paperboard operations are more national in scope and shipments of wallboard and paper are made throughout the continental U.S., except for the northeast, and therefore are more impacted by national trends.
 We operate three frac sand wet processing facilities, three frac sand drying facilities and six frac sand trans-load locations.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we idled our Corpus Christi, Texas frac sand processing plant and our Kenedy, Texas and Fowlerton, Texas trans-load facilities, along with our Utica, Illinois frac sand mine.  We intend to re-open the idled facilities when market conditions improve. Frac sand and oil well cement is currently sold into shale deposit zones across the United States. Demand for oil and gas proppants is impacted primarily by rig counts and well completion activity.
 Demand continues to increase for our construction products and building materials businesses, as underlying economic fundamentals in the U.S. continued to improve during calendar 2016. Cement consumption in the United States, as estimated by the Portland Cement Association, increased approximately 2% to 101.0 million short tons in calendar 2016, compared to 99.0 million short tons in calendar 2015, with imported cement consumption increasing to approximately 14% of total sales in calendar 2016, compared to 13% in calendar 2015. Consistent with the increase in cement consumption nationally, our cement sales volumes increased 2% in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.  
 Demand for gypsum wallboard continues to improve as well, as industry shipments of gypsum wallboard increased to 24.7 billion square feet in calendar 2016, compared to 22.0 billion square feet in calendar 2015, primarily due to increases in single family and multi-family housing starts during calendar 2016 compared to calendar 2015.

  Drilling and completion activity for oil and gas began declining in calendar 2015, and declined throughout calendar 2016, primarily due to the decrease in oil and gas prices during the year, and increased supply of oil.  These conditions adversely impacted drilling activity during calendar 2016, which reduced demand for our frac sand products and oil well cement.  This demand has also had a downward impact on the price of frac sand, which has declined since the peak in 2014.  Conditions have started to improve, and we have seen an increase in demand during the first quarter of calendar 2017, although it is too early to determine if the recovery will continue through calendar 2017.
 Cement, SlaG, CONCRETE AND AGGREGATES Operations 
 Company Operations 
 Cement and Slag. Cement is the basic binding agent for concrete, a primary construction material.  Slag is used in concrete mix designs to improve the durability of concrete and reduce future maintenance costs. The principal sources of demand for cement and slag are infrastructure, commercial construction and residential construction. 
 The manufacture of portland cement primarily involves extracting, crushing, grinding and blending of limestone and other raw materials into a chemically proportioned mixture which is then burned in a rotary kiln at extremely high temperatures to produce an intermediate product called clinker.  The clinker is cooled and mixed with a small amount of gypsum to the consistency of face powder to produce finished cement. All of our cement plants utilize dry process technology and, at present, approximately 80% of our clinker capacity is from preheater or preheater/pre-calciner kilns. 
 Slag granules are obtained from a steel company and ground in our grinding facility.  Slag is used in concrete mix designs to improve the durability of concrete which should reduce future maintenance costs.  
 The following table sets forth certain information regarding our cement plants (tons are in thousands of short tons):

  All of our cement subsidiaries are wholly-owned except the Buda, Texas plant (the “Joint Venture”), which is owned by Texas Lehigh Cement Company LP, a limited partnership joint venture owned 50% by us and 50% by Lehigh Cement Company LLC, a subsidiary of Heidelberg Cement AG. Our LaSalle, Illinois plant operates under the name Illinois Cement Company; the Laramie, Wyoming plant operates under the name Mountain Cement Company; the Fernley, Nevada plant operates under the name Nevada Cement Company; our Fairborn, Ohio plant operates under the name Fairborn Cement Company and our Sugar Creek, Missouri and Tulsa, Oklahoma plants operate under the name Central Plains Cement Company.  We also have a slag grinding facility located in Chicago, Illinois that operates under the name Skyway Cement Company and has capacity to grind 600,000 tons of slag per year.
 Our cement production, including our 50% share of the cement Joint Venture production, totaled 4.5 million and 4.2 million short tons in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Total net cement sales, including our 50% share of cement sales from the Joint Venture, were 4.9 million and 4.8 million short tons in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. 
 Concrete and Aggregates. Readymix concrete is a versatile, low-cost building material used in almost all construction. The production of readymix concrete involves the mixing of cement, sand, gravel, or crushed stone and water to form concrete, which is then sold and distributed to numerous construction contractors. Concrete is produced in batch plants and transported to the customer’s job site in mixer trucks. 
 The construction aggregates business consists of the mining, extraction, production and sale of crushed stone, sand, gravel and lightweight aggregates such as expanded clays and shales. Construction aggregates of suitable characteristics are employed in virtually all types of construction, including the production of readymix concrete and asphaltic mixes used in highway construction and maintenance. 
 We produce and distribute readymix concrete from company-owned sites north of Sacramento, California; Austin, Texas and the greater Kansas City area. The following table sets forth certain information regarding these operations: 
 
 
Location | Number of Plants | | Number of Trucks
--------------------+------------------+----+-----------------
Northern California | | 3 | | 25

----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our total net aggregate sales were 3.6 million and 3.0 million tons in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Total aggregates production was 3.7 million tons and 3.4 million tons for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.

  A portion of our total aggregates production is used internally by our readymix concrete operations in Texas, the greater Kansas City area and California. 
 Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies 
 Cement and Slag. The principal raw material used in the production of portland cement is calcium carbonate in the form of limestone. Limestone is obtained principally through mining and extraction operations conducted at quarries that we own or lease and are located in close proximity to our plants. We believe that the estimated recoverable limestone reserves owned or leased by us will permit each of our plants to operate at our present production capacity for at least 30 years. Other raw materials used in substantially smaller quantities than limestone are sand, clay, iron ore and gypsum. These materials are readily available and can either be obtained from Company-owned or leased reserves or purchased from outside suppliers. 
 Coal and petroleum coke are the primary fuels used in our cement plants, but the plants are equipped to burn natural gas, if necessary. The cost of fuel declined in fiscal 2017, compared to fiscal 2016, primarily due to the decline in the price of coal and petroleum coke, and increased use of petroleum coke and alternative fuels as a percentage of total fuel. The Tulsa plant currently burns fuel quality wastes, as well as coal and petroleum coke, and the Sugar Creek plant currently burns alternative fuels and petroleum coke. When we acquired Sugar Creek and Tulsa in late 2012, both plants had existing alternative fuels programs managed by a company that supplies alternative fuels and materials to the cement plants. In keeping with Eagle’s commitment to sustainability and to cost management, we continued these programs to manage our alternative fuels and materials at those plants. 
 We have a long-term supply agreement with a steel manufacturer to supply granules necessary for the grinding of slag.  This agreement allows for the purchases of 550,000 tons per year.
 Electric power is also a major cost component in the manufacturing process for both cement and slag, and we have sought to diminish overall power costs by adopting interruptible power supply agreements at certain locations. These agreements may expose us to some production interruptions during periods of power curtailment. 
 Concrete and Aggregates. We supply from our cement plants, including our Joint Venture, approximately 100%, 65% and 30% of the cement requirements for our greater Kansas City, northern California and Austin, Texas concrete operations. We internally supply approximately 10%, 40% and 80%, respectively, of our aggregates requirements for greater Kansas City, northern California and Austin, Texas concrete operations. We obtain the balance of our cement and aggregates requirements from multiple outside sources in each of these areas. 
 We mine and extract limestone, sand and gravel, the principal raw materials used in the production of aggregates, from quarries owned or leased by us and located near our plants. The quarry serving our northern California business is estimated to contain over nine hundred million tons of sand and gravel reserves. The quarry serving our Austin, Texas market is covered by a lease which expires in 2060. Based on its current production capacity, we estimate our northern California and Austin, Texas quarries contain over 100 years and approximately 25 years of reserves, respectively. Our quarries in the Kansas City market currently have approximately 50 years of reserves, and we are actively seeking additional more economical reserves to extend the life of the quarry. 
 Sales and Distribution 
 Cement and Slag. The principal sources of demand for cement and slag are infrastructure, commercial construction and residential construction, with public works infrastructure comprising over 50% of total demand. Cement consumption increased approximately 2% during calendar 2016 from calendar 2015, and the Portland Cement Association forecasts cement consumption will increase another approximately 4% in calendar 2017. Demand for cement is seasonal, particularly in northern states where inclement winter weather often affects construction activity. Cement sales are generally greater from spring through the middle of autumn than during the remainder of the year. The impact to our business of regional construction cycles may be mitigated to some degree by our geographic diversification. Demand for slag has increased as the availability of fly ash has decreased due to the conversion of power plants to natural gas from coal.  


 5
 
  The following table sets forth certain information regarding the geographic areas served by each of our cement and slag plants and the location of our distribution terminals in each area. We have a total of 17 cement storage and distribution terminals that are strategically located to extend the sales areas of our plants.

----+---------------------------------------------

 Cement and slag is distributed directly to our customers mostly through customer pickups, as well as by common carriers from our plants or distribution terminals. We transport cement and slag by barge and rail to our storage and distribution terminals. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our cement segment sales during fiscal 2017. Sales are made on the basis of competitive prices in each market and, as is customary in the industry, we do not typically enter into long-term sales contracts or have a significant level of order backlog.  Cement and slag are generally sold to companies in private industry that contract with state and local entities for infrastructure and other public works projects.
 Four of our slag terminals are currently being leased from the former owner of the Skyway Plant.  The initial term of the lease was one year from the date of purchase, and included the option to extend the term for two one year periods. We exercised both options for all locations.
 The cement industry is extremely competitive as a result of multiple domestic suppliers and the importation of foreign cement through various terminal operations. Approximately 75% of the U.S. cement industry is owned by foreign international companies. Competition among producers and suppliers of cement is based primarily on price, with consistency of quality and service to customers being important but of lesser significance. Price competition among individual producers and suppliers of cement within a geographic area is intense because of the fungible nature of the product. Because of cement’s low value-to-weight ratio, the relative cost of transporting cement on land is high and limits the geographic area in which each company can market its products profitably. The low value-to-weight ratio generally limit shipments by truck to a 150 mile radius of the plants and up to 300 miles by rail; therefore, the U.S. cement industry is fragmented into regional geographic areas rather than a single national selling area.  No single cement company has a distribution of plants extensive enough to serve all geographic areas, so profitability is sensitive to shifts in the balance between regional supply and demand. 
 Cement imports into the U.S. occur primarily to supplement domestic cement production or to supply a particular region. Cement is typically imported into deep water ports or transported on the Mississippi River system near major population centers to take advantage of lower waterborne freight costs versus higher truck and rail transportation costs that U.S. based manufacturers incur to deliver into the same areas. 


 6
 
  The Portland Cement Association estimates that imports represented approximately 14% of cement used in the U.S. during calendar year 2016, and approximately 12% in calendar year 2015. Based on the normal distribution of cement into the market, we believe that no less than approximately 5% to 10% of the total consumption will consistently be served by imported cement. 
 Concrete and Aggregates. Demand for readymix concrete and aggregates largely depend on local levels of construction activity. Construction activity is also subject to weather conditions, the availability of financing at reasonable rates and overall fluctuations in local economies, and therefore tends to be cyclical. We sell readymix concrete to numerous contractors and other customers in each plant’s marketing area. Our batch plants in Austin, the greater Kansas City area and northern California are strategically located to serve each marketing area. Concrete is delivered from the batch plants primarily by company-owned trucks. 
 We sell aggregates to building contractors and other customers engaged in a wide variety of construction activities. Aggregates are delivered from our aggregate plants by common carriers and customer pick-up. None of our customers accounted for 10% or more of our segment revenues during fiscal 2017. We are continuing our efforts to secure a rail link from our principal aggregates deposit north of Sacramento, California to supply extended markets in northern California. 
 Both the concrete and aggregates industries are highly fragmented, with numerous participants operating in each local area. Because the cost of transporting concrete and aggregates is very high relative to product values, producers of concrete and aggregates typically can profitably sell their products only in areas within 50 miles of their production facilities. Barriers to entry in each industry are low, except with respect to environmental permitting requirements for new aggregates production facilities and zoning of land to permit mining and extraction of aggregates. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Cement. Our cement operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. Some of these laws, such as the federal Clean Air Act and the federal Clean Water Act (and analogous state laws) impose environmental permitting requirements and govern the nature and amount of emissions that may be generated when conducting particular operations. Some laws, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) (and analogous state laws) impose obligations to clean up or remediate spills of hazardous materials into the environment. Other laws require us to reclaim certain land upon completion of extraction and mining operations in our quarries. We believe that we have obtained all the material environmental permits that are necessary to conduct our operations. We further believe that we are conducting our operations in substantial compliance with these permits. In addition, none of our manufacturing sites is listed as a CERCLA “Superfund” site. 
 Eight environmental issues involving the cement manufacturing industry deserve special mention. 
 The first environmental issue involves cement kiln dust or CKD. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has been evaluating the regulatory status of CKD under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) for a number of years. In 1999, the EPA proposed a rule that would allow states to regulate properly-managed CKD as a non-hazardous waste under state laws and regulations governing solid waste. In contrast, CKD that was not properly managed would be treated as a hazardous waste under RCRA. In 2002, the EPA confirmed its intention to continue to exempt properly-managed CKD from the hazardous waste requirements of RCRA. The agency announced that it would collect additional data over the next three to five years to determine if the states’ regulation of CKD is effective. Although the EPA had previously indicated that it continues to consider an approach whereby it would finalize its 1999 proposal to exempt properly-managed CKD wastes and establish protective CKD management standards, as of May 1, 2017, the EPA still has not finalized the 1999 proposal. It is uncertain whether or when this proposal will be finalized. Nevertheless, in the interim many state environmental agencies have been using the EPA’s 1999 proposed CKD management standards as general industry guidelines. 
 Currently, substantially all CKD produced in connection with our ongoing operations is recycled, and therefore such CKD is not viewed as a waste under RCRA. However, CKD was historically collected and stored on-site at our Illinois, Nevada, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wyoming cement plants and at a former plant site in Corpus Christi, Texas, which is no longer producing cement. If either the EPA or the states decide to reclassify or impose 


 7
 
  new management standards on this CKD at some point in the future, we could incur additional costs to comply with those requirements with respect to our historically collected CKD. CKD that comes in contact with water might produce a leachate with an alkalinity high enough to be classified as hazardous and might also leach certain hazardous trace metals therein. 
 The second environmental issue involves the historical disposal of refractory brick containing chromium. Such refractory brick was formerly used widely in the cement industry to line cement kilns. We currently do not use refractory brick containing chromium, and we crush substantially all of our refractory brick which is then used as raw feed in the kiln. 
 The third environmental issue involves the potential regulation of our emission of greenhouse gasses (“GHGs”), including carbon dioxide, under the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). The consequences of GHG emission reduction regulations for our cement operations will likely be significant because (1) the cement manufacturing process requires the combustion of large amounts of fuel to generate very high kiln temperatures, and (2) the production of carbon dioxide is a byproduct of the calcination process, whereby carbon dioxide is removed from calcium carbonate to produce calcium oxide. 
 In response to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), that GHGs are “air pollutants” and, thus, potentially subject to regulation under the CAA, the EPA has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions from mobile and certain stationary sources. On September 22, 2009, the EPA issued a “Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases” final rule, which took effect December 29, 2009. This rule established a comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources in the United States emitting more than established annual thresholds of GHGs to monitor and report their GHG emissions annually on a facility-by-facility basis. On December 15, 2009, the EPA published a final rule finding that current and projected concentrations of six key GHGs in the atmosphere threaten public health and welfare. Based on this finding, on May 7, 2010, the EPA promulgated a final rule establishing GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles under Title II of the CAA. According to the EPA, the motor vehicle rule triggered construction and operating permit requirements for large stationary sources of GHGs, including cement plants, under Title I of the CAA. On May 13, 2010, the EPA promulgated a final rule, known as the “Tailoring Rule,” addressing the thresholds at which stationary sources of GHGs trigger prevention of significant deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V permitting requirements. PSD review requires an analysis of possible GHG controls and, potentially, the installation of GHG controls or emissions limitations.
 On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion with respect to the Tailoring Rule holding that the EPA can require PSD controls for GHG emissions only for sources subject to PSD review based on another pollutant.   Util. Air Regulatory Grp. v. E.P.A, 134 S. Ct. 2427 (2014). Following the Supreme Court decision, the EPA issued a memorandum clarifying that the EPA intends to continue to apply PSD requirements to GHG emissions if a source emits or has the potential to emit 75,000 tons per year (‘tpy”) or more of GHGs until the EPA establishes a de minimis threshold for GHG emissions below which a source would not be subject to GHG PSD permitting requirements.  The EPA announced its intention to propose a rule addressing the de minimis threshold for GHG PSD permitting in the summer of 2016.  The EPA failed to propose such rule. Until the EPA issues a final rule addressing the de minimis threshold for GHG emissions, any major modification of our existing plants or construction of a new plant that triggers PSD review for non-GHG emissions also would trigger PSD review for GHG emissions if the proposed major modification or construction would result in a GHG emission increase of at least 75,000 tpy.
 In October 2015, the EPA published a rule establishing guidelines for states to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil fuel power plants (the “Clean Power Plan”).  The Clean Power Plan established national performance rates for steam generating units and stationary combustion turbines as well as state emission reduction goals based on the application of the performance rates to a state’s unique generation mix. Numerous states and industry petitioners are challenging the Clean Power Plan on multiple grounds.  On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan while the litigation is pending.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) held oral argument on the challenges to the Clean Power Plan on June 2, 2016.  No opinion in that case has been forthcoming.  On April 28, 2017, at the request of 


 8
 
  the U.S. EPA, the D.C. Circuit issued a per curiam order holding the case in abeyance for sixty days to allow the U.S. EPA to determine whether to reconsider the Clean Power Plan.  EPA must file status reports on its deliberations every 30 days.  EPA has indicated that it intends to significantly amend or repeal the Clean Power Plan.  That will require EPA to propose a new rule that likely will take several years to finalize.  In the interim, the Clean Power Plan is unlikely to be implemented.  In the future, it is likely that the EPA will propose performance standards for GHG emissions for other sectors, including cement manufacturing, so the ultimate outcome of the Clean Power Plan could affect the timing and form of standards for cement plants.  
 Several states have individually implemented measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG inventories or registries or regional GHG “cap and trade” programs. California’s AB 32 program is the most advanced of such state initiatives, with regulations affecting all major sources of GHGs. States also have joined together to form regional initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. 
 It is not possible at this time to predict how any future legislation that may be enacted or final EPA regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business. However, any imposition of raw materials or production limitations, fuel-use or carbon taxes, or emission limitations or reductions could have a significant impact on the cement manufacturing industry and a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. 
 The fourth environmental issue is the EPA’s promulgation on September 9, 2010 of final regulations establishing national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants for portland cement plants (“PC NESHAP”) pursuant to Section 112 of the CAA. For specific hazardous air pollutants (“HAPs”), the final rule requires cement plants to meet certain emission and operating standards. The rule sets limits on mercury emissions from existing Portland cement kilns and increases the stringency of emission limits for new kilns. The rule sets emission limits for total hydrocarbons, and also sets emission limits for particulate matter as a surrogate for non-volatile metal HAPS, from cement kilns of all sizes, and reduces hydrochloric acid emissions from kilns that are large emitters. As a result of industry challenges to the regulations, the EPA issued a revised rule on February 12, 2013. The revised rule made two notable changes to the 2010 HAP regulations. First, the rule established less stringent emission standards for total hydrocarbons and particulate matter. Second, the rule extended the deadline for existing sources to comply with the HAP regulations to September 9, 2015. We do not believe we are placed at a competitive disadvantage by the revised rule. 
 A fifth environmental issue involves excess emissions that may occur during periods of startup, shutdown or malfunction.  In June 2015, the EPA issued a rule requiring revisions to 36 state implementation plans (“SIPs”) that allowed exemptions or contained affirmative defenses to excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown or malfunction (“SSM rule”).  The SIP revisions were submitted to the EPA in November 2016. The states required to revise their SIPs include states where the company has operations, such as Illinois, Oklahoma, Missouri and Texas.  Under the revised SIPs, companies would be required to comply with their emissions limits at all times, including during startup, shutdown and malfunctions.  States and members of industry have challenged the SSM rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  
 On April 24, 2017, at the request of the EPA, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("D.C. Circuit") issued an order holding in abeyance the consolidated challenges to the EPA’s final rule concerning how provisions in the EPA-approved SIPs treat excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown or malfunction. The order also cancels oral argument, which was scheduled for May 8, 2017. In its motion, EPA argued that oral argument should be delayed in light of the recent change in Administration. According to the motion, the EPA "intends to closely review the SSM rule, and the prior positions taken by the Agency with respect to the SSM rule may not necessarily reflect its ultimate conclusions after that review is complete." The EPA’s motion was opposed by environmental groups, who argued that the EPA failed to establish the "extraordinary cause" required for postponement. The D.C. Circuit’s order requires the EPA to file status reports on the Agency’s review of the SSM Rule at 90-day intervals. It further mandates that the parties file motions to govern future proceedings within 30 days of the EPA notifying the court and the parties what action it has or will be taking with respect to the SSM rule.  As a result, we cannot predict how or whether the SSM rule will be changed.

  The sixth environmental issue is the EPA’s promulgation pursuant to Section 129 of the CAA of revised regulations for Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration (“CISWI”) units. Clean Air Act Section 129 requires the EPA to set standards for solid waste incineration units.  Affected sources must comply with the revised CISWI regulations the earlier of 3 years after State CISWI plan approval, or 5 years from the date of the final rule on reconsideration. On June 23, 2016, the EPA published a final rule reconsidering four provisions of the February 2013 final CISWI rule, including relaxing the particulate matter standard for solid waste-burning kilns and eliminating the affirmative defense to penalties for non-compliance during well documented malfunction events.  On January 11, 2017, the EPA published a proposed plan that would implement the previously promulgated limits for existing CISWI in states that have not submitted and received approval for a state implementation plan. The proposed federal plan would require owners or operators of impacted CISWI units to come into compliance by February 7, 2018.  Currently, the EPA has not approved any state implementation plans.  Compared to the PC NESHAP, the CISWI regulations contain requirements for more pollutants and the requirement for dioxin/furans for existing and new sources is somewhat more stringent. 
Whether a facility is a CISWI unit regulated under Section 129 of the Clean Air Act or a cement plant regulated under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act hinges on whether it combusts “solid waste” as that term is defined under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. On March 21, 2011 (and also revised on February 7, 2013), the EPA finalized the Identification of Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials that Are Solid Waste (“NHSM”) rule. The NHSM rule’s primary purpose is to provide the definition of solid waste that is used to determine if a cement kiln is regulated under CISWI regulations or the PC NESHAP regulations. The rule lays out processing and legitimacy criteria that are used to determine if a non-traditional fuel is a solid waste. Combustion of a solid waste triggers applicability of the CISWI requirements. On July 29, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion in U.S. Sugar v. EPA, No. 11-1108, largely upholding the 2011 and 2013 CISWI rules.   
 At some of our operations, kilns are or will be using non-hazardous secondary materials as a replacement for traditional fuels used in the manufacturing process. These kiln systems are capable of beneficially utilizing a wide array of NHSM and may be subject to the CISWI requirements, depending on whether these materials are identified as “solid wastes” under the NHSM rule. The EPA issued a rule clarifying the definition of “solid waste” and establishing a uniform recycling standard for all hazardous secondary materials recycling on January 13, 2015, which became effective on July 13, 2015. Solid waste-burning kilns must meet the CISWI emission and operating standards. Non-waste burning kilns must prove any alternative fuels used are not solid wastes. We do not believe we would be placed at a competitive disadvantage by either the NHSM or the CISWI rule. 
 The seventh environmental issue is a revision to the Hazardous Waste Combustor National Emission Standards for Hazardous Waste Standards (“HWC NESHAP”). The Tulsa, Oklahoma cement facility utilizes hazardous waste as fuel and is required to meet the emission and operating standards of the HWC NESHAP. This facility has demonstrated and remains in compliance with all of the requirements of the current HWC NESHAP regulation. On October 12, 2005, as a result of ongoing litigation, the EPA promulgated final HWC regulations, with compliance required for all facilities by 2008. On October 28, 2008, the EPA promulgated a final rule addressing eight issues for which the EPA granted reconsideration.  The final rule on reconsideration did not change the compliance date for existing sources established by the 2005 rule.  Environmental and industry organizations filed lawsuits in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging the 2005 and 2008 regulations. The EPA subsequently agreed to revise the HWC NESHAP standards in accordance with an agreement with litigants, and the court remanded, without vacatur, the 2005 and 2008 regulations to the EPA for further consideration. The EPA has not indicated when it will issue a proposed rule amending the regulations. It is not possible to predict at this time the stringency or impact of revised HWC NESHAP regulations or timing required for compliance. 
 We believe that our current procedures and practices in our operations, including those for handling and managing hazardous materials, are consistent with industry standards and are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, because of the complexity of our operations and the environmental laws to which we are subject, there can be no assurance that past or future operations will not result in violations, remediation costs or other liabilities or claims. Moreover, we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted or adopted in the future or how such future environmental laws or regulations will be administered 


 10
 
  or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent environmental laws, or stricter interpretation of existing environmental laws, could necessitate significant capital outlays. 
 The eighth environmental issue is the EPA’s ongoing review and implementation of the national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone.  In October 2015, the EPA strengthened the ozone NAAQS by lowering the primary and secondary standards from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb.  As a result of this change, the EPA is required to make attainment/nonattainment designations for the revised standards by October 2017.  We are currently reviewing this final rule and cannot at this time predict the impact it may have on our operations.  Nonattainment designations in or surrounding our areas of operations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial results. On April 11, 2017, at EPA’s request, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an order holding consolidated challenges to the 2015 ozone NAAQS in abeyance, and canceling oral argument in the challenges.  In requesting to hold the case in abeyance, EPA explained that the new Administration was planning to review the 2015 Ozone NAAQS “to determine whether the Agency should reconsider the rule or some part of it.”  The order requires EPA to file status reports on the Agency’s review of the NAAQS at 90-day intervals.
 Concrete and Aggregates. The concrete and aggregates industry is subject to environmental regulations similar to those governing our cement operations. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Cement and Slag. We had capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our cement operations of $6.2 million during fiscal 2017 and anticipate spending an additional $14.2 million during fiscal 2018 at this time. 
 Concrete and Aggregates. We had capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our concrete and aggregates operations of $0.6 million during fiscal 2017. We anticipate spending approximately $0.1 million in fiscal 2018 at this time. 
 Gypsum Wallboard and RECYCLED PAPERBOARD Operations 
 Company Operations 
 Gypsum Wallboard. Gypsum wallboard is used to finish the interior walls and ceilings in residential, commercial and industrial structures. Our gypsum wallboard business is marketed under the name American Gypsum. 
 There are four primary steps in the gypsum wallboard manufacturing process: (1) gypsum is mined and extracted from the ground (or, in the case of synthetic gypsum, received from a power generation company); (2) the gypsum is then calcined and converted into plaster; (3) the plaster is mixed with various other materials and water to produce a mixture known as slurry, which is extruded between two continuous sheets of recycled paperboard on a high-speed production line and allowed to harden; and (4) the sheets of gypsum wallboard are then cut to appropriate lengths, dried and bundled for sale. 
 We currently own five gypsum wallboard manufacturing facilities; however, we idled our gypsum manufacturing facility in Bernalillo, New Mexico in December 2009, due to cyclical low wallboard demand. We are planning to restart our Bernalillo plant during fiscal 2018, and anticipate running this plant as necessary to meet customer demand.

----+--------------------------------------

 Our gypsum wallboard production totaled 2,539 MMSF in fiscal 2017 and 2,406 MMSF in fiscal 2016. Total gypsum wallboard sales were 2,483 MMSF in fiscal 2017 and 2,394 MMSF in fiscal 2016. 
 Recycled Paperboard. Our recycled paperboard manufacturing operation, which we refer to as Republic Paperboard Company, is located in Lawton, Oklahoma, and has a technologically advanced paper machine designed primarily for gypsum liner production. The paper’s uniform cross-directional strength and finish characteristics facilitate the efficiencies of new high-speed wallboard manufacturing lines and improve the efficiencies of the slower wallboard manufacturing lines. Although the machine was designed primarily to manufacture gypsum liner products, we are also able to manufacture several alternative products, including containerboard grades and lightweight packaging grades. To maximize manufacturing efficiencies, namely machine width, recycled industrial paperboard grades are produced. 
 Our paper machine allows the paperboard operation to manufacture high-strength gypsum liner that is approximately 10-15% lighter in basis weight than generally available in the U.S. The low-basis weight product utilizes less recycled fiber to produce paper that, in turn, requires less energy (natural gas) to evaporate moisture from the board during the gypsum wallboard manufacturing process. The low-basis weight paper also reduces the overall finished board weight, providing wallboard operations with more competitive transportation costs for both the inbound and outbound segments. 
 Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies 
 Gypsum Wallboard. We mine and extract natural gypsum rock, the principal raw material used in the manufacture of gypsum wallboard, from mines and quarries owned, leased or subject to mining claims owned by the Company and located near our plants. Certain of our New Mexico reserves are under lease with the Pueblo of Zia. Gypsum ore reserves at the Gypsum, Colorado plant are contained within a total of 115 placer claims encompassing 2,300 acres. Included in this are 94 unpatented mining claims where mineral rights can be developed upon completion of permitting requirements. We currently own land containing gypsum in the area of Duke, Oklahoma, with additional reserves controlled through a lease agreement. Other gypsum deposits are located near the plant in Duke, which we believe may be obtained at reasonable cost when needed. We are currently in the ninth year of a sixty-year supply agreement (original twenty-year term with two twenty-year extension options) with a public utility in South Carolina for synthetic gypsum, which we use at our Georgetown, South Carolina plant. If the 


 12
 
  utility is unable to generate the agreed-upon amount of gypsum, it is responsible for providing gypsum from a third party to fulfill its obligations. 
 Through our modern low cost paperboard mill we manufacture sufficient quantities of paper necessary for our gypsum wallboard production. Paper is a significant cost component in the manufacture of gypsum wallboard, currently representing approximately one-third of our cost of production. 
 Our gypsum wallboard manufacturing operations use natural gas and electrical power. A significant portion of the Company’s natural gas requirements for our gypsum wallboard plants are currently provided by three gas producers under gas supply agreements expiring in May 2018 for New Mexico and October 2017 for South Carolina and Oklahoma. If the agreements are not renewed, we anticipate being able to obtain our gas supplies from other suppliers at competitive prices. Electrical power is supplied to our New Mexico plants at standard industrial rates by a local utility. Our Albuquerque plant utilizes an interruptible power supply agreement, which may expose it to some production interruptions during periods of power curtailment. Power for our Gypsum, Colorado facility is generated at the facility by a cogeneration power plant that we own. Currently, the cogeneration power facility supplies power and waste hot gases for drying to the gypsum wallboard plant. We do not sell any power to third parties. Gas costs represented approximately 7% of our production costs in fiscal 2017. 
 Recycled Paperboard. The principal raw materials are recycled paper fiber (recovered waste paper), water and specialty paper chemicals. The largest waste paper source used by the operation is old cardboard containers (known as OCC). A blend of high grades (white papers consisting of ink-free papers such as news blank and unprinted papers) is used in the gypsum liner facing paper, white top linerboard and white bag liner grades. 
 We believe that an adequate supply of OCC recycled fiber will continue to be available from sources located within a reasonable proximity of the paper mill. Although we have the capability to receive rail shipments, the vast majority of the recycled fiber purchased is delivered via truck. Prices are subject to market fluctuations based on generation of material (supply), demand and the presence of the export market. The current outlook for fiscal 2018 is for waste paper prices, namely OCC, to increase approximately 10% over fiscal 2017 prices. Current gypsum liner customer contracts include price escalators that partially offset/compensate for changes in raw material fiber prices. The chemicals used in the paper making operation, including size, retention aids, biocides and bacteria controls, are readily available from several manufacturers at competitive prices. 
 The manufacture of recycled paperboard involves the use of large volumes of water in the production process. We have an agreement with the City of Lawton municipal services for supply of water to our manufacturing facility. Electricity, natural gas and other utilities are available to us at either contracted rates or standard industrial rates in adequate supplies. These utilities are subject to standard industrial curtailment provisions. 
 Paperboard operations are generally large consumers of energy, primarily natural gas and electricity. During fiscal 2017, natural gas and electricity costs were lower compared to fiscal 2016. The reduced costs were the result of both lower energy prices and lower usage rates. We expect natural gas and electricity pricing to remain fairly consistent in fiscal 2018. Electricity is supplied to the paper mill by Public Service of Oklahoma (PSO). This power company is working to switch its fuel source dependency to natural gas, which could impact our electricity rates in future years. Oklahoma is a regulated state for electricity services and all rate change requests must be presented to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission for review and approval before implementation. 
 Sales and Distribution 
 Gypsum Wallboard. The principal sources of demand for gypsum wallboard are (i) residential construction, (ii) repair and remodeling, (iii) non-residential construction, and (iv) other markets such as exports and manufactured housing.  We estimate that residential and repair and remodel construction accounted for more than 85% of calendar 2016 industry sales. Demand for gypsum wallboard remains highly cyclical; and closely follows construction industry cycles, particularly housing construction. Demand for wallboard can be seasonal and is generally greater from spring through the middle of autumn. 


 13
 
  We sell gypsum wallboard to numerous building materials dealers, gypsum wallboard specialty distributors, lumber yards, home center chains and other customers located throughout the United States, with the exception of the northeast. Gypsum wallboard is sold on a delivered basis, mostly by truck. We generally utilize third-party common carriers for deliveries. Two customers accounted for approximately 25% of our gypsum wallboard segment sales during fiscal 2017. 
 Although gypsum wallboard is distributed principally in local areas, certain industry producers (including the Company) have the ability to ship gypsum wallboard by rail outside their usual regional distribution areas to regions where demand is strong. We own approximately 100 railcars for transporting gypsum wallboard. In addition, in order to facilitate distribution in certain strategic areas, we maintain a distribution center in New Mexico. Our rail distribution capabilities permit us to service customers in markets on both the east and west coasts, except for the northeast. Approximately 10% of our wallboard volume sold was delivered via rail.
 There are seven manufacturers of gypsum wallboard in the U.S. operating a total of approximately 60 plants. We estimate that the three largest producers - USG Corporation, National Gypsum Company and Koch Industries - account for approximately 60% of gypsum wallboard sales in the U.S. Due to the commodity nature of the product, competition is based principally on price, which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand. Product quality and customer service are also important to the customer. 
 Total wallboard rated production capacity in the United States is currently estimated at approximately 33.0 billion square feet per year; however, certain lines have been curtailed and plants closed or idled. It is possible that previously closed plants or lines could be brought back into service. The Gypsum Association, an industry trade group, estimates that total calendar 2016 gypsum wallboard shipments by U.S. manufacturers were approximately 24.7 billion square feet. 
 Recycled Paperboard. Our manufactured recycled paperboard products are sold to gypsum wallboard manufacturers and other industrial users. During fiscal 2017, approximately 35% of the recycled paperboard sold by our paper mill was consumed by the Company’s gypsum wallboard manufacturing operations. We also have contracts with two other gypsum wallboard manufacturers that represent approximately 50% of our total segment revenue with the remaining volume shipped to other gypsum liner manufacturers and bag producers.  The current contracts with other gypsum wallboard manufacturers expire in one and six years.  The loss of either of these contracts or a termination or reduction of their current production of gypsum wallboard, unless replaced by a commercially similar arrangement, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Environmental Matters 
 Gypsum Wallboard. The gypsum wallboard industry is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. Some of these laws, such as the federal Clean Air Act and the federal Clean Water Act (and analogous state laws), impose environmental permitting requirements and govern the nature and amount of emissions that may be generated when conducting particular operations. Some laws, such as CERCLA (and analogous state laws), impose obligations to clean up or remediate spills of hazardous materials into the environment. Other laws require us to reclaim certain land upon completion of extraction and mining operations in our quarries. None of our gypsum wallboard operations is the subject of any local, state or federal environmental proceedings or inquiries. We do not, and have not, used asbestos in any of our gypsum wallboard products. 
 On April 17, 2015, the EPA published its final rule addressing the storage, reuse and disposal of coal combustion products, which include fly ash and flue gas desulfurization gypsum (“synthetic gypsum”). We use synthetic gypsum in wallboard manufactured at our Georgetown, South Carolina plant. The rule, which applies only to electric utilities and independent power producers, establishes standards for the management of coal combustion residuals (“CCRs”) under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, which is the Subtitle that regulates non-hazardous wastes. The rule imposes requirements addressing CCR surface impoundments and landfills, including location restrictions, design and operating specifications, groundwater monitoring requirements, corrective action requirements, recordkeeping and reporting obligations, and closure 


 14
 
  requirements. Beneficial encapsulated uses of CCRs, including synthetic gypsum, are exempt from regulation. The rule became effective on October 14, 2015. Given the EPA’s decision to continue to allow CCR to be used in synthetic gypsum and to regulate CCR under the non-hazardous waste sections of RCRA, we do not expect the rule to materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In October 2015, the EPA strengthened the national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone by lowering the primary and secondary standards from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb.  As a result of this change, the EPA is required to make attainment/nonattainment designations for the revised standards by October 2017.  Nonattainment designations in or surrounding our areas of operations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial results.  
 Our gypsum wallboard manufacturing process combusts natural gas. It is possible that GHG emissions from our manufacturing could become subject to regulation under the CAA. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see the “Environmental Matters” section of our cement business description on pages 8-12. 
 Although our gypsum wallboard operations could be adversely affected by federal, regional or state climate change initiatives, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business. However, any imposition of raw materials or production limitations, fuel-use or carbon taxes or emission limitations or reductions could have a significant impact on the gypsum wallboard manufacturing industry and a material adverse effect on the financial results of our operations. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Gypsum Wallboard and Recycled Paperboard. There were no capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our gypsum wallboard and recycled paperboard operations during fiscal 2017. We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $0.3 million related to our gypsum wallboard operations during fiscal 2018. 
OIL AND GAS PROPPANTS OPERATIONS 
 Company Operations 
 We currently own two frac sand mines, three frac sand wet processing plants and three frac sand drying facilities. Our frac sand mines and wet plants are in New Auburn, Wisconsin and Utica, Illinois. Our frac sand drying facilities are currently in New Auburn, Wisconsin and Corpus Christi, Texas, as outlined in the table below. Sand is processed into various mesh sizes and marketed primarily to oil service companies.  We distribute sand through the following trans-load facilities to complement our production operations: El Reno, Oklahoma; Cotulla, Texas; Odessa, Texas; San Antonio, Texas; Pecos, Texas; Kenedy, Texas; and Fowlerton, Texas.  
 We are currently planning the build out of our Utica, Illinois facility.  This build out will include the addition of a dry plant and distribution system.  We estimate that this build out will cost approximately $70.0 million and will be completed in the summer of 2018.
 The following table provides information regarding our frac sand production facilities at March 31, 2017: 
 
 
Wet Plant Location | Owned or Leased Reserves | Estimated Annual Wet Production Capacity (Thousand tons)(3) | | Estimated Minimum Reserves (Thousand Tons)(1) | | Estimated Minimum Reserves (Years) | | | Fiscal 2016 Tons Mined (Thousand Tons)(2) |

----+--------------------------------

 As a result of the decline in oil and gas drilling, and the corresponding reduction in demand for proppants, we elected to temporarily idle our Utica, Illinois and Corpus Christi, Texas facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, and these facilities remained idled throughout fiscal 2017.  Additionally, the Fowlerton, Texas; Kenedy, Texas and Cotulla, Texas trans-load operations remained idled throughout fiscal 2017.  Our facilities are relatively new, and are in very good physical condition.  We plan on resuming business at these facilities in the future when demand for proppants increases, and additional capacity is needed.  The cost of maintaining these idled facilities is not considered to be significant.  Due to the decline in demand for proppants, and the idling of the operating facilities and three trans-load locations, we performed a test for impairment on the long-lived assets of the oil and gas proppants segment.  Based on the results of this test, no impairment was recorded.  See Critical Accounting Policies, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets on page 45 for more information about the test for impairment.
 Raw Materials and Fuel Supplies 
 We mine our frac sand from open pit mines, and process the sand in our wet plants. The excavation process includes stripping the overburden overlaying the planned mining area, and removing the sand through blasting or mechanically with the use of mobile equipment. Processing includes washing the sand with water, and screening to remove non-salable material after which the sand is dried and further screened to its final mesh sizes, which range from 20 mesh to 140 mesh. During the winter months, the cold weather adversely impacts our ability to operate our wet processing plants, resulting in these plants being shut-down for much of the winter.  Generally, our New Auburn, Wisconsin facility is impacted more by the weather than our Utica, Illinois facility.  
 Natural gas is the major fuel used in our wet and dry plants. The cost of natural gas declined throughout fiscal 2017, and is not expected to fluctuate materially in fiscal 2018. Electricity and water are also major cost component in our manufacturing process. We do not anticipate significant changes in the cost of these utilities in fiscal 2018. 
 Sales and Distribution 
 A portion of the frac sand we produce is sold under long-term contracts that require our customers to pay a specified price per mesh size for a specified volume of sand each month, or quarter depending on the contract. The terms of our customer contracts, including pricing, delivery and mesh distribution, vary by customer. Certain of our long-term customer contracts contain liquidated damages for non-performance by our customers. The decline in U.S. rig count and completion activity during fiscal 2016 adversely impacted oil and gas activity leading to reduced demand and pricing for proppants.  As a result, we renegotiated certain provisions of our long-term contracts with certain customers. The renegotiated contracts reflect the reduced demand for frac sand in the current environment by restructuring the contracts to provide reduced contracted sales volumes and prices in the near term, with the contracted minimums being increased in the later years.  In addition to the long-term sales contracts, we sell frac sand through our distribution network under short-term pricing and other agreements. The terms of our short-term pricing agreements vary by customer.
 We currently have contracts to provide frac sand to four customers, which comprised approximately 70% of our segment revenues for fiscal 2017.  These contracts have a remaining life of approximately four years.

  We utilize in basin trans-load facilities as a part of our distribution network.  The San Antonio, Texas; Cotulla, Texas; Pecos, Texas and Odessa, Texas trans-load locations are supplied by rail, and operated by third-party contractors.  The El Reno, Oklahoma trans-load location is also supplied by rail, and is operated by company personnel.  Frac sand is delivered to the sites in rail cars specifically designed for loading and unloading sand.  At March 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,000 rail cars under lease, with an average term of approximately four years.  Our Corpus Christi location is served by barge, and the Kenedy, Texas and Fowlerton, Texas trans-load sites are served by truck from Corpus Christi.  
 Environmental Matters 
 We and the commercial silica industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation pertaining to matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, hazardous materials, air and water emissions, and environmental contamination and reclamation. A variety of federal, state and local agencies have established, implement and enforce these regulations.
 Federal Regulation. At the federal level, we may be required to obtain permits under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands and streams, in connection with our operations. We also may be required to obtain permits under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act from the EPA or the state environmental agencies, to which the EPA has delegated local implementation of the permit program, for discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States, including discharges of wastewater or storm-water runoff associated with construction activities. Failure to obtain these required permits or to comply with their terms could subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief.
 The U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. These regulatory programs may require us to install expensive emissions abatement equipment, modify operational practices, and obtain permits for existing or new operations. Before commencing construction on a new or modified source of air emissions, such laws may require us to reduce emissions at existing facilities. As a result, we may be required to incur increased capital and operating costs to comply with these regulations. We could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctive relief for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the U.S. Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations.
 As part of our operations, we utilize or store petroleum products and other substances such as diesel fuel, lubricating oils and hydraulic fluid. We are subject to regulatory programs pertaining to the storage, use, transportation and disposal of these substances. Spills or releases may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases, including claims for damage or injury to property and persons. CERCLA and comparable state laws may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed of or arranged for disposal, including offsite disposal, of a hazardous substance generated or released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
 In addition, RCRA and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. The EPA and state environmental agencies, to which the EPA has delegated portions of the RCRA program for local implementation, administer the RCRA program.
 Our operations may also be subject to broad environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of all “major federal actions” significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The granting of a federal permit for a major development project, such as a mining operation, may be considered a “major federal action” that requires review under NEPA. Therefore, our projects may require review and evaluation under NEPA. As part of this evaluation, the federal agency considers a broad array of environmental impacts, including, among other things, impacts on air

  quality, water quality, wildlife (including threatened and endangered species), historic and archaeological resources, geology, socioeconomics and aesthetics. NEPA also requires the consideration of alternatives to the project. The NEPA review process, especially the preparation of a full environmental impact statement, can be time consuming and expensive. The purpose of the NEPA review process is to inform federal agencies’ decision-making on whether federal approval should be granted for a project and to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of a proposed project. Though NEPA requires only that an environmental evaluation be conducted and does not mandate a particular result, a federal agency could decide to deny a permit or impose certain conditions on its approval, based on its environmental review under NEPA, or a third party could challenge the adequacy of a NEPA review and thereby delay the issuance of a federal permit or approval.
 Federal agencies granting permits for our operations also must consider impacts to endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the Endangered Species Act. We also must comply with and are subject to liability under the Endangered Species Act, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for the harming of endangered or threatened species and their habitat. Federal agencies also must consider a project’s impacts on historic or archaeological resources under the National Historic Preservation Act, and we may be required to conduct archaeological surveys of project sites and to avoid or preserve historical areas or artifacts.
 State and Local Regulation. We are also subject to a variety of state and local environmental review and permitting requirements. Some states, including Wisconsin where one of our operations is located, have state laws similar to NEPA; thus our development of a new site or the expansion of an existing site may be subject to comprehensive state environmental reviews even if it is not subject to NEPA. In some cases, the state environmental review may be more stringent than the federal review. Our operations may require state-law based permits in addition to federal permits, requiring state agencies to consider a range of issues, many the same as federal agencies, including, among other things, a project’s impact on wildlife and their habitats, historic and archaeological sites, aesthetics, agricultural operations, and scenic areas. Wisconsin and some other states also have specific permitting and review processes for commercial silica mining operations, and state agencies may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. The development of new sites and our existing operations also are subject to a variety of local environmental and regulatory requirements, including land use, zoning, building, and transportation requirements.
 Some local communities have expressed concern regarding silica sand mining operations. These concerns have generally included exposure to ambient silica sand dust, truck traffic, water usage, and blasting. In response, certain state and local communities have developed or are in the process of developing regulations or zoning restrictions intended to minimize the potential for dust to become airborne, control the flow of truck traffic, significantly curtail the area available for mining activities, require compensation to local residents for potential impacts of mining activities and, in some cases, ban issuance of new permits for mining activities. We are not aware of any proposals for significant increased scrutiny on the part of state or local regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate or community concerns with respect to our operations that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations going forward.
 Planned expansion of our mining and production capacity in new communities could be more significantly impacted by increased regulatory activity. Difficulty or delays in obtaining or inability to obtain new mining permits or increased costs of compliance with future state and local regulatory requirements could have a material negative impact on our ability to grow our business. In an effort to minimize these risks, we continue to be engaged with local communities in order to grow and maintain strong relationships with residents and regulators.
 Capital Expenditures 
 There were no capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental regulations applicable to our oil and gas proppants operations during fiscal 2017, and we do not anticipate any such expenditures during fiscal 2018.
Employees 
 As of March 31, 2017, we had approximately 2,200 employees, of which approximately 800 were employed under collective bargaining agreements and various supplemental agreements with local unions.
