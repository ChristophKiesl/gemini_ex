Item 1. Business
Unity is the world’s leading platform for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content. We believe the world is a better place with more creators in it. Creators, ranging from game developers to artists, architects, automotive designers, filmmakers, and others, use Unity to make their imaginations come to life.
Our platform provides a comprehensive set of software solutions to create, run and monetize interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles, and augmented and virtual reality devices. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we had, on average, approximately 2.7 billion monthly active end users who consumed content created or operated with our solutions. The applications developed by these creators were downloaded, on average, five billion times per month in 2020.
Content built on the Unity platform offers end-users a fundamentally more engaging and immersive experience than traditional static content. Content made with Unity is interactive, allowing end-users to connect with the content and with one another. Content made with Unity is real-time, allowing it to instantly adapt to end-user behavior and feedback. Content made with Unity allows graphics to be expressed with 3D shape and depth, permitting multiple viewing angles, and enabling augmented and virtual reality.
Real-time is not just a part of the end-user experience. Building content on Unity offers creators significant advantages in development compared to traditional content creation tools. Creators can visualize and iterate on their 2D and 3D creations in real-time and collaborate with each other to edit content simultaneously. This can lead to significant reductions in design and development cycle times. The demand for interactive, real-time 3D content is expanding rapidly. Compute processors have become dramatically faster and more powerful. Improvements in bandwidth have enabled smartphones, PCs, consoles and other devices to connect at a global scale. Cloud computing has removed the limitations on processing power and storage to support content. These factors are driving significant increases in available compute power and are enabling the spread of immersive and interactive content. As a result, creators can now develop more intricate, higher fidelity experiences for end-users to enjoy on more devices and across larger connected communities. The gaming industry has benefited enormously from these enabling technologies with over 2.6 billion gamers driving the fastest growing sector in media today.
Unity has built its reputation in gaming, and our scale and reach in this industry are significant. We estimate that in the fourth quarter of 2020, 71% of the top 1,000 mobile games were made with Unity. Unity’s platform helps game developers—from the largest publishers in the world with teams of hundreds, to mid-sized, small and independent publishers, to individual creators—build and operate high quality games, rapidly and efficiently. Unity games can be built once and deployed and operated across more than 20 platforms, including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and the leading augmented and virtual reality platforms, among others. As gaming has proliferated, the business models for content have evolved beyond one-time purchases to include advertising and in-app purchases. Unity enables these new business models by providing creators with the solutions they need to easily run and monetize their content.
The dramatic growth of end-user demand for interactive content is driving industries beyond gaming to embrace the advantages of real-time 3D content. Creators are leveraging our platform to provide faster content creation and efficient deployment across formats and use cases. Today, Fortune and Global 500 companies in industries such as architecture, engineering, construction, automotive, transportation, manufacturing, film, television and retail are using Unity across many new use cases, including automobile and building design, online and augmented reality product configurators, autonomous driving simulation, and augmented reality workplace safety training. These new forms of content are emerging parts of our business and represent a significant opportunity for growth.

Unity Software Inc.

Our platform consists of two distinct, but connected and synergistic, sets of solutions. Our Create Solutions are used by content creators—developers, artists, designers, engineers, and architects—to create interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content. Our Operate Solutions offer customers the ability to grow and engage their end-user base, as well as run and monetize their content with the goal of optimizing end-user acquisition and operational costs while increasing the lifetime value of their end-users.
We offer our Create Solutions primarily through monthly subscriptions and our Operate Solutions primarily through revenue-share and usage-based models. This allows us to generate revenue from our customers as they develop content and also as they succeed and grow. Subscriptions for our Create Solutions drive adoption of our Operate Solutions.
We have experienced rapid growth. Our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $772.4 million, $541.8 million, and $380.8 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 43% and 42%, respectively. We generated net losses of $282.3 million, $163.2 million, and $131.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, which included $134.6 million, $44.5 million, and $20.9 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had $19.9 million net cash provided by operating activities and $67.9 million and $81.1 million net cash used in operating activities, respectively.
The Future is Interactive, Real-Time 3D
For almost a hundred years, photos and video content have largely been created by the same means—capturing three dimensional images through a 2D lens and projecting them onto a 2D surface. Technology has introduced digital cameras, lenses for capturing images at astonishing resolutions and powerful software tools that allow creators to edit and manipulate images with limitless possibilities. Still, the basic processes and technology related to content and content creation revolve around building 2D, asynchronous non-interactive, static content.
The world is changing. Leaps forward in compute power and bandwidth are enabling an explosion in interactive, real-time 3D content—led by games and now spreading rapidly into other industries. We have moved from a static content world to one of lifelike, dynamic content—where 2D images are no longer projected to create video, but where fully interactive, 3D virtual objects, environments and complete worlds can be digitally rendered in real-time using software. Nowhere has real-time 3D had a larger impact to date than in gaming, which has grown from a less than $15 billion industry 20 years ago to one generating over $159 billion in annual revenue today based on boxed/downloaded PC, browser PC, console, tablet, and smartphone game revenue. Gaming is now the fastest growing category in media with over 2.5 billion gamers worldwide.
Interactive, real-time 3D is:
•Interactive: allowing end-users from around the world to connect with immersive content as well as one another. Today’s games take players into lifelike scenes and landscapes, where they can engage with dynamic content. In multiplayer environments, content interaction instantly influences other players’ experience of the game. As one player pushes a button for an object to go right, it enters another player’s point of view instantly, in real-time.
•Real-Time: allowing content to be rendered at up to 120 photorealistic images per second on a digital display. Display pixels can be drawn and redrawn as fast as the human eye can see, rendering content that is instantly responsive to end-user actions and appears lifelike.
•3D: allowing graphics to be expressed with shape and depth, permitting multiple viewing angles. An end-user can virtually pick up an object, look underneath, move it around and enjoy an entirely new and unique experience, all in the same environment. The opportunities of augmented and virtual reality are only made possible through 3D.

Unity Software Inc.

Interactive, real-time 3D is also driving innovation in the content creation process. For example, with real-time technology, creators can live-edit the characteristics of objects in games and applications they design, and these changes can be rendered and displayed faster than the blink of an eye. This instantaneous adaptation allows for creators to simultaneously create and visualize, simplifying the creative process and making collaborative content development more seamless and efficient.
While interactive, real-time 3D has fueled the rise of gaming, the opportunities for this technology and the benefits for creators are impacting many other industries as well:
•Architecture: For architects, transforming building development and architectural data for the 3D world has been a challenge. Seemingly small post-design changes can take months to rework. Architects, designers and project partners use this real-time 3D to simultaneously contribute to the planning and development of a building with rapid, cost-effective iteration. Onsite construction teams and technicians can visualize before, and as they build. Interactive, 3D designs can be virtually overlaid onto actual construction through augmented reality, to detect design flaws early, which significantly reduces the risk of future rebuilds and drives project efficiencies.
•Automotive: The automotive industry is often challenged by a long, slow development cycle for new car models. The traditional process involves disparate tools in the iterative creation and recreation of a new model. Real-time 3D technology is driving efficiencies in car development and sales cycles, allowing for interactive, life-like models of cars to be rendered in real-time. These “digital twins” can be used for marketing or personalized sales experiences at dealerships and online.
•Film: Filmmakers are finding that real-time technology yields faster results and provides more creative freedom than traditional filming and editing solutions. Real-time technology removes the need for server farms that generate single frames over hours, eliminating the need to wait days for dailies or for servers to fully render a digital scene. Because creation becomes be real-time, a filmmaker can edit and review a scene instantly, allowing higher quality productions to reach audiences more quickly.
Across these industries and more, our solutions and technology are unlocking new forms of creativity and cost-efficiency that are impossible with traditional tools.

Our Solutions
Our products and services help creators to develop, run and monetize interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content. We make real-time creation accessible to all—from students, enthusiasts and individuals to large game publishers and Fortune and Global 500 companies. Our platform has two distinct, but connected sets of solutions: Create Solutions and Operate Solutions.
Create Solutions
Unity’s Create Solutions offer developers, artists, designers, engineers and architects the tools that they need to create immersive and interactive experiences. Central to our Create Solutions is a robust software development engine that comprises a suite of technologies, accessible through the Unity editor user interface, including custom scripting tools, a high-definition render pipeline, graphics, animation and audio tools, navigation, networking and user interface tools. These solutions allow creators to easily create, edit and iterate interactive 2D or 3D content, in real-time.

Unity Software Inc.

Our Create Solutions can also be augmented with additional functionality from Unity or from third parties. For example, the Unity Asset Store is a marketplace and scaled aggregator used by our customers to find software, content and tools that assist them in the creation of real-time interactive games and applications.
Operate Solutions
Unity’s Operate Solutions offer customers the ability to grow and engage their user bases, and to run and monetize their content. Our solutions collectively empower our customers to maximize the lifetime value of end-users, while optimizing the cost of acquiring and engaging end-users, and of operating and hosting their applications.
The majority of our Operate Solutions products can support any content, regardless of whether or not the content was created using our Create Solutions. However, Operate Solutions are easier to implement and more impactful when used together with our Create Solutions. For content created with our Create Solutions, many of our Operate Solutions can be accessed from within the editor, enabling design and development that is optimized from day one for user monetization and engagement, and for operations efficiency.
Our Products
We offer a comprehensive content development and operations platform, composed of our Create Solutions and our Operate Solutions that together provide a full set of products to support the scale and performance requirements of immersive, interactive, real-time 3D content.
Create Solutions
The foundation of our Create Solutions is a robust software development engine that comprises a suite of technologies, configurable through the Unity editor user interface, including custom scripting tools, a high-definition render pipeline, graphics, animation and audio tools, navigation, networking and user interface tools. The editor is accessible on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems and enables creators to drag and drop content, such as images, textures, 3D meshes and sounds, into a virtual workspace. From there, creators can configure content and compose it into scenes of objects, such as three-dimensional characters, buildings, automobiles or landscapes.
A large variety of components can be added to the objects to make content dynamic and interactive. Unity physics is an example of a component, which, when added to an object in our editor, causes the object to behave as it would in the real world, subject to the forces of friction and gravity. Other components may add animation, photo-realistic textures or movement to the object.
Once the creation of a game or other application is completed in the editor and the creator wants to deploy content, our platform compiles all of the application’s components around the Unity runtime. The Unity runtime is a critical part of a Unity application that allows content created on our platform to be interactively rendered in real-time on end-user devices. Content created in our editor can be easily deployed to over 20 platforms using our runtime, limiting the need for creators to invest in proprietary development technology around each and every platform.
Our Create Solutions allow creators to easily develop, edit and iterate interactive 2D and 3D content, in real-time. We offer our customers tiered subscription plans designed to meet the needs of different types of customers:
•Unity Pro: designed for customers with over $200,000 in annual revenue or funding, provides access to our engine with additional benefits, such as prioritized customer support, collaboration tools, and the option to purchase professional services, additional support, and licenses to our source code.

•Granite: provides an advanced texture system for content. By automatically loading and managing texture tiles, Granite is able to handle large amounts of texture data while using less memory, significantly reducing loading time for larger, detailed virtual worlds.
We have introduced and will continue to develop Create Solutions that are specifically focused on industries beyond gaming, such as Unity Reflect and Unity Forma, and emerging augmented and virtual reality platforms, like Unity MARS.
•Unity Reflect: enables creators in architecture, engineering, and construction to seamlessly transfer building information modeling, or BIM, data into Unity to create real-time 3D experiences across multiple platforms, including augmented and virtual reality. Released in late 2019, Reflect allows multiple designers and building engineers working on different systems to bring their data sets into one Reflect project, while maintaining a live connection to original design models. This functionality enables augmented and virtual reality and iOS, PC, and Mac viewers to review live-linked models in real-time. Reflect is accessible to any designer, including those not familiar with developing on our platform.
•Unity MARS: gives creators professional-grade workflows for augmented and virtual reality development. Unity MARS brings environment and sensor data into the creative process, enabling creators to build applications that are context-aware and responsive to physical space. Creators are able to build, prototype and visualize data-oriented applications in real-time without leaving the Unity editor.
•Unity Forma: offers creators a product configuration toolkit with the high fidelity of Unity’s real-time 3D interactivity and rendering power. Creators are empowered to fast-track the creation of visually appealing digital marketing experiences for use cases across industries such as automotive, retail, and others. These experiences, or configurators, can be distributed to a wide audience through the significant and varied platform compatibility of the Unity runtime.
Operate Solutions
Our Operate Solutions offer customers the ability to grow and engage their end-users, and to run and monetize their content, optimizing end-user acquisition and operational costs while increasing the lifetime value of their end-users.

Unity Software Inc.

User Acquisition and Monetization
Many of our customers create games and applications with the purpose of building a profitable business. This requires both the acquisition of end-users at a reasonable cost and the monetization of these end-users as they engage over time with the content.
Our user acquisition products enable advertisers to efficiently acquire new end-users at scale. They operate within our monetization ecosystem, which reached over 2.6 billion monthly active end users as of December 31, 2020, making it one of the largest global user bases for advertisers. Our focus and strength are in pay-for-performance end-user acquisition, where advertisers pay us based on a tangible outcome or set goal, such as an install, rather than on a cost per impression basis. As a result, a large number of our advertisers have open spending limits with us as they can clearly measure the positive return on their spend.
•Personalized Advertising: an end-user acquisition product that uses machine learning combined with our deep player and game data to drive end-user installs at scale. Advertisers can define campaigns based on several parameters:
•Reach: advertisers define the amount they are willing to pay for each install. Our algorithm maximizes reach and identifies the audience with the highest propensity to install.
•Retention: our algorithms dynamically adjust the cost per install based on the likelihood of customer retention over 7-day, 14-day and other retention periods. This minimizes the risk that our customer will spend to acquire end-users that are unlikely to yield attractive returns, including those that churn almost immediately.
•Desired Return on Ad Spend (ROAS): our algorithms dynamically adjust the cost per install based on a combination of the ROAS target set by the advertiser and the predicted lifetime value of an end-user.
•Contextual Advertising: a product designed for cases in which our customers or their end-users opt-out of personalization within apps. With the depth and breadth of our in-game data, we can deliver highly relevant advertising while respecting stricter privacy elections.
Our monetization products generate revenue for our customers in two primary ways. First, we provide in-app advertising technology that connects our customers to a broad range of advertisers is powered by our Unified Auction. Second, we provide micro-transaction capabilities that enable revenue through in-app purchases, or IAP.
•Unity Ads: enables developers to seek the highest value for each impression of their inventory, through our Unified Auction, from a broad range of advertisers including direct Unity customers as well as demand side platforms, or DSPs. Each time an event is triggered within our customer’s application, our auction determines the best advertisement to show the end user. Customers can access Unity Ads through a software development kit that enables ad delivery, rendering, and transactions.
•Unity IAP: allows for the sale of virtual goods within free or paid games on all major platforms by enabling creators to create once and connect to all major platform stores (for example the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store), utilizing a convenient single integration.

Unity Software Inc.

End-User Engagement
Beyond user acquisition and monetization, one of the biggest challenges for our customers is end-user churn. Retention and content consumption rates are significantly higher for those that build and continuously strengthen relationships with their end-users. Our deep insights powered by machine learning and our sophisticated customer relationship management tools empower our customers to create, optimize and deliver personalized experiences for their end-users, increasing customer retention and engagement rates and resulting in higher end-user lifetime value (LTV).
•deltaDNA: a portfolio of services our customers use to understand behaviors of end-users within their game and to take action to improve user experiences. These services include:
•In-depth, high fidelity analytics tools used to understand end-user behavior and drive insights.
•Predictive tools that automatically promote actions that will improve LTV through personalization of content and monetization strategies. One such example is the determination of whether to show an in-app purchase promotion versus advertising content depending on an individual end-user’s preferences.
•Machine-learning driven capabilities that predict the likelihood of player churn or an in-app purchase. With this information, our customers can further personalize content and run campaigns to retain these players at scale.
•A Dynamic Ad Placement tool that optimizes ad placement across as many unique surface points as the developer chooses to integrate. Our machine-learning driven algorithms connect customer data with rich content selection and our ad monetization models to maximize both retention and revenue for higher end-user LTV.
•GameTune: a machine learning solution that provides data science as a service. This gives customers the ability to optimize end-user engagement based on a combination of game elements, such as game progression speed, in-app purchase bundles and difficulty settings.
Cloud Operations
Developers face technical challenges and unpredictable costs as they launch and run multiplayer, multi-platform games and applications across mobile, PC and console platforms and game genres. Delays and downtimes are detrimental to our customers, who therefore place a high value on reliable solutions with predictable cost structures. Our Multiplay, Vivox, Cloud Content Delivery, Build Server, and Simulation products focus on delivering real-time content and on optimizing the end-user experience.
•Multiplay: a dynamic orchestration service that optimizes performance and cost by choosing the best hosting solution in real-time, leveraging the leading third-party cloud service providers as well as co-located data centers. This bypasses the complexity of creating and operating back-end technology and infrastructure, reducing the time and resources required to launch and operate real-time multiplayer games at scale.
•Vivox: a hosted voice and text service that enables end-users to communicate with each other within real-time games and applications, and across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and consoles. It features 3D positional audio that enables life-like communications within a 3D world.

Digital Channel
We reach independent creators and mid-sized, small and independent studios through our self-service web-based channel. We deploy a range of marketing strategies and tactics to drive initial awareness, adoption and retention. These include online evangelism, our Made with Unity sub-brand and learning programs for enthusiasts and students.
New creators often start by using our free Unity Personal or Unity Student plans. We encourage continued creator engagement by providing free resources, such as creator education, Asset Store access, and enrollment into our network of Unity creators. Customers do not need to upgrade to a paid plan until they reach $100,000 in annual revenue or funding. For our Operate Solutions, we enable customers to easily get started by providing a self-service platform for our monetization solutions and free use of our Vivox product for up to 5,000 concurrent users. The majority of our Operate Solutions customers are on boarded through our self-serve platform and require minimal upfront investment to get started.
Many of our free users become champions for Unity, creating word-of-mouth advertising for our products and services. As creators engage more deeply with Unity, they often upgrade to paid plans via our website or sales teams. We support this upgrade path through targeted marketing campaigns and in-product prompts highlighting the added benefits and features of our paid plans. The significant majority of Unity’s monthly active creators are free users, and we see this as an opportunity for future growth.
Customer and Community Support
We believe that highly responsive and effective support and education are an extension of our brand and are core to building and maintaining creator loyalty and trust.
Our community support team assists creators using both the free and paid versions of our Create Solutions to drive adoption, subscription renewal and free-to-paid conversion. Additionally, our customer experience team receives and quantifies feedback from brands, agencies and studios using Unity at scale. This focus on responsiveness and personal touch helps us improve customer satisfaction and identify high-value opportunities for product improvements.
We tier our support levels based on customer size. Creators using our free solutions have access to chat, email and web-based community resources, while paid customers have access to additional levels of higher-touch support. Our community resources serve as the foundation for all of our levels of support, giving creators the opportunity to discuss challenges and solutions with experienced Unity creators and interact with our expert support team via:
•Forums: the central hub of our community discussions. Creators can voice their opinions, show what they are working on and ask for advice.

Unity Software Inc.

•Answers: our self-service repository for all solutions relating to common questions on product and workflows.
•Documentation: available from within the product, our documentation, which is translated into four languages, covers how to use every component in Unity.
Our customer success team supports our large customers through every step of their journey with Unity. This starts with onboarding and sharing of best practices, as well as product education, and continues with support for renewals and introductions to additional Unity products and solutions. We have teams dedicated to provide specialized support for each of our products.
Our educational offerings include a range of free, web-based classes and tutorials on how to use, administer, optimize and customize Unity. We also offer in-person training through our developer relations program and at our Unity-hosted community events. Our Unite conferences and participation in various developer-centric conferences provide creators with tangible skills to launch, market, and monetize successful games and applications.
Our Strategic Relationships
We have a robust and diverse partner ecosystem that includes leading hardware, operating system, device, game console, and other technology providers. Our partners benefit from their relationship with us through growth in engagement of our customers with their ecosystem.
Our partner ecosystem is critical to our create once and deploy anywhere value proposition to our customers and is an important part of our go-to-market strategy. Partners also serve as a source of brand awareness and sales leads in new industries, and help to accelerate our sales cycles through co-marketing programs.
Research and Development
Our engineering and product teams and culture are customer-oriented and work alongside customers to deliver high value, high quality features and functionality across the numerous devices and platforms we support. We deliver these features through frequent updates to our Create and Operate Solutions that align with each type and version of platform, including updates to mobile, PC, virtual reality platforms, and more.
Our research and development efforts are distributed around the world and focus on a number of areas including, but not limited to, our core engine, Operate Solutions, vertical solutions, and AI and simulation tools. Combined with our support for numerous platforms, we have also developed significant expertise in build, test and deployment tools, technologies and automation, for both traditional, native-code, monolithic repositories as well as package-based, cloud hosted packages. These tools enable us to work independently and efficiently and maintain a rapid sustained pace of innovation.
Over the last two years, we have invested more than $650.0 million in research and development to build our platform. We had 2,236 employees involved in research and development and related activities as of December 31, 2020, which accounted for 56% of our total headcount.
Competition
We primarily compete with other content development tools and monetization services. Most of these competitors offer point solutions which represent a subset of the offerings on our platform:
•Create Solutions: We primarily compete against proprietary game engines built in-house by large game studios, as well as Cocos2d-x (Chukong Technologies) and Unreal Engine (Epic Games), which offer game development tools primarily serving the PC games and mobile games sectors, and, in the case of Unreal Engine (Epic Games), industries beyond gaming. Outside of gaming, we also compete with other development platforms that offer 2D and 3D design products.

Unity Software Inc.

•Operate Solutions: With respect to our Operate Solutions, we operate in a fragmented ecosystem composed of select divisions of large, well-established companies as well as privately held companies. The large companies in our ecosystem may play multiple different roles given the breadth of their business. Examples of these large companies are Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Tencent. Most of these companies are also our partners and customers.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are:
•cross-platform deployability;
•the pace and quality of new product innovation;
•product capabilities, including flexibility, scalability, performance, security, and reliability;
•integration with existing platforms;
•high-quality customer support, training, and services;
•brand recognition and reputation;
•return on investment of sales and marketing efforts;
•volume and leverage of user data and analytics;
•price and affordability of our solutions and customer economics;
•ease of use of products; and
•ability to expand to adjacent industries.
We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.
Technology Infrastructure and Operations
We have built our technology infrastructure using a distributed and scalable architecture on a global scale. We designed our technology platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and to deliver high availability and low latency. Incremental backups are performed twice a day and full backups are performed daily. Backups are preserved for a time period directly proportional to the criticality of the data.
Redundant copies of content are stored in several geographically separate regions and are replicated within each region. Data is transmitted in encrypted form. We mainly use Google Cloud Platform as our processing and delivery cloud infrastructure but also have some services with other cloud infrastructure providers and some with special hardware/security requirements running on our own, private data center. With respect to the Google Cloud Platform, we are party to a cloud service agreement with Google, pursuant to which we are committed to spend an aggregate of $210.5 million between April 2018 and April 2024. If we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitment during any year, we are required to pay the difference. Either we or Google may terminate the agreement if the other party is in material breach and fails to cure the breach within 30 days after receiving written notice. We expect to meet our remaining commitment under this agreement.
We have built a service operations infrastructure with automated, 24x7 telemetry, supported by a team to help ensure that any issues that arise with our services are addressed as quickly as possible.
Security, Privacy, and Data Protection
At Unity we understand that creative assets, performance and user data are critical to our customers’ businesses. We devote considerable resources to our security program, regularly testing the security of user assets utilized by our services, and developing easy-to-use features that content creators can leverage to enhance the security of their creative products.

Unity Software Inc.

Security
Our team of security practitioners, working in partnership with peers across our company, works to identify and mitigate risks, assess our security measures against industry standards and best practices, and continue to evaluate ways to improve. We focus on four core components: Application Security, Infrastructure Security, Incident Response, and Governance and Compliance. In addition to these core components, we drive a program of Responsible Disclosure to engage and gain support of the research community to identify advanced issues for remediation. Our security program is focused on expanding our documentation and audit functions in order to ready us for industry certifications that will be important for our growth in industrial and government markets.
Privacy and Data Protection
The privacy of developers and application users and protection of the data in our ecosystem are important to Unity’s continued growth and success. We maintain a dedicated privacy team that leads a group of employees, federated throughout the organization, who serve in roles responsible for data governance and management within product groups and functional areas. We conduct privacy impact assessments and data protection impact assessments, conduct product and feature reviews, maintain a reasonably exhaustive list of data collected and processed, and provide support for data protection and privacy-related requests. Our privacy team reports progress on the program and its functions quarterly to a team of executives charged with data governance oversight, and conducts regular privacy-related training. Additionally, our Data Protection Officer periodically updates the audit committee of our board of directors on changes in laws and Unity’s compliance activities.
We are committed to complying with, and helping our customers comply with, data protection laws globally. We monitor guidance from industry and regulatory bodies, meet with regulators and update our product features and contractual commitments when necessary to meet new or evolving privacy legal requirements.
We maintain a privacy policy that describes how Unity collects, uses and discloses information, and what choices organizations and users have.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other legal and contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 47 issued patents in the United States that expire between 2032 and 2038, 12 issued patents in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and 93 patent applications (including 26 provisional applications and four active PCT applications) pending in the United States and globally. While we believe our patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to our competitive position, no single patent or patent application is material to us as a whole.
We have trademark rights in our name and other brand indicia and have trademark registrations for select marks in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.unity.com and similar variations.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.

Human Capital Management
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 4,001 full-time employees, across 45 offices in 18 countries. We also engage contractors and consultants. We had 2,042 employees in technical roles, which accounted for 51% of our total headcount. In addition, our geographic diversification enhances our ability to retain and attract talent, and as of December 31, 2020, approximately 66% of our full-time employees were located outside of the United States.
Employee engagement and company pride is strong. Based on our recent employee engagement survey, we have an employee engagement score of 84%, which is 11 percentage points higher than our benchmark comparative firms, and 95% of our employees said that they would recommend Unity as a great place to work.
We believe the strength of our culture, fueled by our commitment to our values, inclusion, and social impact, makes Unity an exceptional place for top talent to work and grow.
Our Values and Commitment to Inclusion
The Unity Values capture what we represent and form the foundation of our company culture. They have a material impact on how we do our jobs and how we treat each other every day. They also guide us in making the right decisions for our customers, partners and creators. Our values are: Users First, Best Ideas Win, In It Together, and Go Bold.
Users First: We put users first, they are the reason we do what we do. Our shared dedication to our customers holds us together, defines and aligns our work and drives us to deliver for them.
Best Ideas Win: We believe great ideas can come from anywhere. We have vigorous debates, we listen and learn, and we make sure the best ideas win. We care enough to go through the pain of messy conversations.
In It Together: We are Citizens of Unity. We act like owners. We’re activists; we have a voice and use it. We’re direct and candid, with good intent. We deeply collaborate towards shared goals and respect each other’s unique contributions.
Go Bold: We do bold things. We go big and when we fail, we learn, get better and go big again. We challenge and elevate each other beyond our limits to do what may seem impossible. We stay curious and hungry.
We live out these values through our global framework for Inclusion, which centers on three principles: Empathy, Respect, and Opportunity. Empathy fuels connection, respect builds trust, and opportunity empowers employees. These principles cascade throughout our company and encourage us all to meet each other where we are and celebrate our differences.
Empathy is the ability to recognize and validate the perspectives and experiences of others, even without connecting yourself to those experiences. It’s about listening to understand—not to respond.
Respect is rooting your efforts in empathy, by taking every-day actions that acknowledge individual experiences and perspectives.
Opportunity is demonstrating respect for the knowledge and experience of others by empowering them to contribute, create or lead based on that knowledge and experience.
We invest in our culture in many ways, including a Unity Leadership Program run by senior leaders, frequent Town Hall meetings, executive roundtables, manager and employee development opportunities, and a global Workplace Experience team dedicated to curating local cultural events including yoga, meditation, coffee talks, and game nights.

Unity Software Inc.

Unity’s benefit offerings are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of a diverse workforce. In response to COVID-19, we have enhanced the ways we help our employees care for themselves and their families through expanded mental health benefits and support for remote working. We are continuing to build on our inclusive benefit offerings and programs, led by our Inclusion and Global Benefits teams.
Our Commitment to Social Impact
We love creators—those bold enough to create what is in their imagination to change the world. Creators are change makers and Unity is their platform for change. Since our founding, we have focused on empowering our creators and employees to make the world a better place.
In October 2020, Unity launched Unity Social Impact, a division of the business aimed at empowering employees and creators of all backgrounds to foster a more inclusive, sustainable world. Unity Social Impact consists of three pillars: Education and Economic Opportunity for All, Sustainability, and Health and Well-being. The announcement of the new division was underpinned by the establishment of the Unity Charitable Fund, a program that provides the financial mechanism to bring the goals of Social Impact division to life. Created in partnership with Tides Foundation, the Unity Charitable Fund includes 750,000 shares of Unity common stock.
Government Regulations
Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.
