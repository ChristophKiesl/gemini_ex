ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
FREYR Battery, a Luxembourg public limited liability company (“société anonyme”) (“FREYR,” the “Company”, “we”, or “us”), is a developer of clean, next-generation battery cell production capacity. Our mission and vision are to accelerate the decarbonization of global energy and transportation systems by producing clean, cost-competitive batteries. Through our strategy of Speed, Scale, and Sustainability, we seek to serve our primary markets of energy storage systems (“ESS”); commercial mobility, including marine applications and commercial vehicles; and electric vehicles (“EV”).
We are in the design and testing phase related to our battery production process and we are in the final stages of the construction of our Customer Qualification Plant (“CQP”) and groundworks and foundation structures for our inaugural gigafactory (“Giga Arctic”), both located in Mo i Rana, Norway. We have also announced the launch of our first clean battery cell manufacturing project in the U.S. (“Giga America”) located in Coweta County, Georgia and we have announced the exploration of a potential gigafactory site in Vaasa, Finland.
Our initial CQP production line is based on our licensed SemiSolidTM technology and cooperation with 24M Technologies, Inc. (“24M”) and lithium-ion chemistry. Future development and expansion could incorporate alternative chemistry models and additional advances in battery technology through our ongoing cooperation with 24M, through joint ventures, and other licensing opportunities. We will initially target market opportunities in ESS, commercial mobility, and EV with high density and slower charge requirements, with plans to target additional markets, including faster charge battery cells for the broader consumer EV market.
As of December 31, 2022, we have not yet initiated manufacturing or derived revenue from our principal business activities.
Background and Business Combination
On January 29, 2021, FREYR AS, a private limited liability company organized under the laws of Norway (“FREYR Legacy”) and Alussa Energy Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Alussa”), among others, entered into the Business Combination Agreement (the “BCA”) to effect a merger between the companies (the “Business Combination”). FREYR was formed on January 20, 2021, to complete the Business Combination and serves as the successor entity to FREYR Legacy, the predecessor entity.
The merger was completed in multiple stages, pursuant to the terms of the BCA, which included among other things, the transfer of FREYR Legacy’s wind farm business to Sjonfjellet Vindpark Holding AS (“SVPH”), resulting in SVPH shares being held by FREYR Legacy’s shareholders. On July 8, 2021, FREYR’s ordinary shares and warrants began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). On July 9, 2021, FREYR completed the Business Combination and FREYR Legacy and Alussa became wholly owned subsidiaries of FREYR.
The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with Alussa treated as the “acquired” company for financial reporting purposes and FREYR issuing shares for the net assets of Alussa, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Alussa were stated at historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.
As a result, the consolidated financial statements included herein reflect (i) the historical operating results of FREYR Legacy prior to the Business Combination, (ii) the combined results of FREYR, FREYR Legacy and Alussa following the closing of the Business Combination, (iii) the assets and liabilities of FREYR Legacy at their historical cost, (iv) the assets and liabilities of FREYR and Alussa at their historical cost, which approximates fair value, and (v) FREYR’s equity structure for all periods presented.
Markets and Customers
The global battery market is projected to grow significantly over the next decade driven by the ongoing energy industry’s transformation from traditional fossil fuel energy production systems to renewable energy sources requiring ESS and the decarbonization of transport of commercial and passenger mobility. We believe FREYR is well positioned to capitalize on these industry trends and strives to accelerate this decarbonization by developing and producing cleaner batteries at giga scale through our strategy of Speed, Scale, and Sustainability.
FREYR is initially targeting market opportunities in ESS, marine applications, commercial vehicles, and EVs with high density and slower charge requirements, with plans to target additional markets, including faster charge battery cells for the broader consumer EV market.
In late 2022, FREYR completed the formation of the previously announced module and pack joint venture with Nidec Corporation (“Nidec”) and executed the binding sales (offtake) agreement to supply 38 Gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of LFP Li-Ion battery cells from 2025 to 2030 to the joint venture, with options for the joint venture to increase the volume to 50 GWh and to extend the contract beyond 2030. The total firm and optional volume under the offtake agreement comprises 50% of the planned production volumes for Giga Arctic. The joint venture will combine FREYR’s clean, next-generation battery cells with Nidec’s expertise as a global leader in the ESS business and will produce modules and packs and generate integrated downstream ESS solutions for industrial and utility grade customers. Conditional offtake agreements have been 
executed with Powin, and other leading ESS and energy technology companies. Conditional offtake agreements are non-binding to the parties. We believe these agreements form a basis for FREYR’s entry into the ESS marketplace.
Strategy
Our vision is to accelerate the decarbonization of all transportation and energy systems with our mission to produce the world’s most cost effective, efficient, and environmentally friendly batteries.
FREYR works at speed to:
•Maximize speed to market of low-carbon, cost-competitive battery cells;
•Capitalize on the projected battery shortfall as electrification accelerates; and
•Commercialize proven technology in battery cell manufacturing.
FREYR intends to maximize scale by:
•Building manufacturing capacity on a gigafactory basis;
•Targeting major addressable markets for electrification; and
•Addressing substantial unmet demand across the ESS, commercial mobility, and EV market segments.
FREYR prioritizes sustainability by:
•Sourcing localized, low-cost, decarbonized, and renewable energy;
•Commercializing low-carbon production methods based on 24M’s SemiSolidTM technology; and
•Forming strategic alliances to help ensure decarbonized low-cost raw material supply.
Competitive Landscape 
FREYR’s competitors include major battery manufacturers currently supplying the markets, automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), and potential new entrants, including CATL (China), BYD (China), LG Chem (South Korea), Samsung SDI (South Korea), SK Innovation (South Korea), Panasonic (Japan), and Northvolt (Sweden). Additionally, there are several development-stage companies seeking to improve conventional lithium-ion batteries or to develop new technologies for batteries. These companies are in varying stages of development and commercialization.
FREYR seeks to compete with these companies by fulfilling the customers’ needs for localized production and supply of batteries and on the basis of its sustainable, low-cost production practices. Localized production of batteries allows for a more secure supply and lower transportation costs, and initiatives in Europe and the U.S. are seeking to source batteries outside of China to minimize political and national security concerns. FREYR’s production strategy includes manufacturing batteries using renewable energy and our licensed technology from 24M, which allows for a simplified manufacturing process, lower costs, and more efficient recycling after the end of the product’s lifecycle. This is expected to provide our customers with more sustainable batteries.
International Expansion and Plant Construction
FREYR is concurrently developing its production capacity with giga scale factories in the Nordic region and in the U.S. FREYR intends to install 50 GWh of battery cell production capacity by 2025, 100 GWh annual production capacity by 2028, and 200 GWh of annual production capacity by 2030.
Customer Qualification Plant
We are in the final stages of the construction of our 13 thousand square meter CQP in Mo i Rana, Norway. Our initial CQP production line is based on our licensed SemiSolidTM technology and cooperation with 24M and lithium-ion battery chemistry, as discussed further below. Production from the customer qualification plant will be used to provide samples to enable early customer engagement and to test new material suppliers and new solutions over time and will incorporate a battery testing center. This is important to our initial product development and continued optimization of our battery products to meet evolving customer needs. Future development and expansion could incorporate alternative chemistry models and additional advances in battery technology through our ongoing cooperation with 24M and/or joint ventures, and licensing opportunities.
Giga Arctic
In June 2022, FREYR formally sanctioned the construction of Giga Arctic, our 120 thousand square meter inaugural gigafactory which combines our previously announced Gigafactory 1 & 2. This is the first full scale battery manufacturing facility we have sanctioned, and it is currently under development in Mo i Rana, Norway. We have completed the initial groundworks and foundation structures for a portion of the facility, which is ultimately expected to have an annual nameplate capacity of up to 29 GWh over eight production lines, with an initial estimated capital cost of more than $1.7 billion. The timing of the start of production will be primarily driven by the successful startup of CQP battery cell production and testing, and the timing of project and other financing activities, and is expected to follow the completion of funding activities by a 
period of 18 to 24 months. We believe Giga Arctic will also serve as a blueprint for an idealized and modularized battery cell manufacturing facility that can be rapidly replicated in other locations.
Giga America
In November 2022, the Company, through its U.S. subsidiary FREYR Battery US LLC, acquired approximately 368 acres of land in Coweta County, Georgia, which is intended to be the site of the Company’s Giga America clean battery cell manufacturing project. The initial cell production module is expected to have an annual capacity of approximately 34 GWh and will be established with the U.S.-based 24M production platform and based on the Giga Arctic manufacturing blueprint. Production at Giga America is expected to meet the demand for U.S. based customers.
This acceleration of FREYR’s previously planned expansion into U.S. markets is based on strong tailwinds in U.S. renewable energy development, an intensifying focus on grid stability initiatives, and the tax incentives associated with the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) which was signed into law in the U.S. on August 16, 2022. The IRA includes $369 billion in climate and energy-related provisions, including those to incentivize and accelerate the build-out of renewable energy and accelerate the adoption of EV technologies. The IRA creates specific tax credit incentives for the manufacturing and production of battery cells, modules, and electrode materials in the U.S., and extends the investment tax credit to standalone battery storage technology projects for the first time without co-location requirements to solar or wind developments. The IRA will likely drive significantly lower battery costs and prices in the U.S., potentially leading to a surge in domestic ESS activity.
Finland
In May 2022, FREYR signed an agreement with the City of Vaasa, Finland, for the lease of approximately 1.3 million square meters of land in the Vaasa area. This land is a potential future site for FREYR’s developmental initiatives based on the Company’s collaboration with the City of Vaasa.
Research & Development and Technology Licenses
Research and Development
FREYR’s research and development (“R&D”) activities are primarily related to the startup of manufacturing and process optimization of the 24M technology manufacturing process using lithium-ion chemistry. Additional R&D activities could incorporate alternative chemistry models and additional advances in battery technology both through our ongoing partnership with 24M, joint ventures, and licensing opportunities.
The Company’s primary R&D locations currently include the following leased facilities:
•CQP in Mo i Rana, Norway - This facility focuses on the continual improvement and optimization of our manufacturing process, including the qualification of suppliers and testing of materials and cells, as well as the development of products to meet specific customer needs; 
•Technology resources, campus and business unit in Fukuoka, Japan - This facility focuses on the facilitation and scale-up of FREYR’s testing and development of the 24M battery platform;

•R&D center in Trondheim, Norway - This facility is located near the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and provides additional support for our R&D activities in Mo i Rana, Norway.
24M License and Technology
FREYR, through its subsidiaries FREYR AS and Freyr Battery KSP JV, LLC, executed two similar license and services agreements with 24M, dated December 15, 2020, (as subsequently amended and collectively the “24M License”). The 24M License provides FREYR with rights, which in specified cases are on an exclusive basis, to exploit certain patents and patent applications useful for or related to the manufacture, assembly, test, operation, and service of SemiSolidTM battery cells and modules owned, controlled, developed, or acquired by 24M or any of its affiliates, noting that 24M and FREYR have agreed to a limited exclusivity, non-compete, and additional licensing framework. Additionally, 24M will provide certain services to FREYR, including technical training of engineers, provision of information relevant to construct and operate the factory, and on-site support.
The 24M License will continue for the duration of the licensed patents and patent applications begin validly in force unless terminated earlier by FREYR or 24M pursuant to the terms of the 24M License.
The cost of the rights and services in the 24M License was $20.0 million, payable in several installments and an ongoing royalty fee based on sales volumes. Additionally, 24M and FREYR have agreed to an additional service fee of $8.8 million in exchange for the completion of R&D work packages related to cell performance. The fee is payable in four equal installments of $2.2 million, the first of which was paid in January 2023. The estimated period of performance for the 
services is 20 months, spanning from November 2022 until June 2024. The service fee is recognized as R&D expense on a straight-line basis over the service period.
24M’s SemiSolidTM cell architecture and associated production process reduces the number of steps required to manufacture traditional battery cells, while still using conventional materials, as discussed further below. The 24M process incorporates technology that is expected to provide significant advantages over traditional manufacturing processes. FREYR expects to be able to apply this battery cell and production process technology to any commercially available cathode and anode chemistry for a wide range of applications. Initially, the 24M technology will be used to produce batteries for utility scale and commercial ESS, commercial vehicles, and EVs with slower charge requirements. 24M is also developing faster charge EV solutions for the broader consumer EV segment based on the 24M production platform which could further increase the market penetration and adoption of the technology.
Aleees License and Technology
In October 2022, FREYR signed a license and services agreement with Taiwan based Advanced Lithium Electrochemistry Co., Ltd. (“Aleees”). The agreement, which includes ongoing services and support from Aleees, provides FREYR with a 20-year worldwide license to produce and sell lithium-iron phosphate (“LFP”) cathode battery material based on Aleees’ technology and to build production facilities leveraging Aleees’ industrial experience. The license is cancellable without cause at FREYR’s option after 10 years. Aleees is a qualified supplier of LFP cathode material to 24M and an established LFP cathode producer outside of mainland China. LFP cathode materials represent a significant component of the cost of a battery cell and the projected full-cycle supply chain carbon footprint of cells. Through this agreement and in cooperation with Aleees, FREYR believes it is positioned to become a low cost and low carbon producer of LFP cathode material.
Manufacturing Process
Production
FREYR’s cell production process in our initial CQP production line and in our Giga Arctic facility is based on our licensed SemiSolidTM technology and partnership with 24M and lithium-ion battery chemistry. The battery cell manufacturing process is accomplished in multiple steps over three major stages - electrode creation, cell assembly, and formation and aging. Traditional electrode manufacturing includes the mixing and coating of multiple thin layers of anode and cathode materials to produce the electrode. In FREYR’s cell production process, fewer thicker layers are created. During assembly of the cell, the electrode is wound or stacked as determined by the final cell configuration. Aging, charge and discharge cycles, and testing of the cell can then occur. Manufactured battery cells are assembled into packs and modules for a variety of applications. The anticipated advantages of the 24M process technology over traditional battery manufacturing methods include:
•Less raw materials than factories with comparable capacity; 
•Significant reduction in the number of production steps, which could result in a material reduction in required manufacturing footprint, energy consumption, and labor requirements;
•Production process free of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (“NMP”), an industrial solvent subject to regulation in Europe which requires a complex and costly recovery process;
•Chemistry-agnostic platform supporting current and next generation anode and cathode chemistries, such as higher silicon content anodes, higher voltage cathodes, dual electrolyte systems, and pre-lithiation implementation;
•Significant reduction in the use of inactive raw materials, due to thicker electrodes with more active, energy carrying material;
•Larger cell formats; and
•Simplified recycling process, primarily due to the elimination of the need for a binder.
In August 2022, FREYR announced a strategic partnership with South Korea based Hana Technology Co. Ltd (“Hana Technology”) to jointly develop formation and aging, pouch assembly, and inspection and packaging equipment and automation solutions for FREYR’s planned gigafactories. This strategic alliance frame agreement will enable FREYR and Hana Technology to customize and co-develop solutions for our gigafactories.
In September 2022, FREYR announced key contracts related to constructing and equipping its Giga Arctic manufacturing facility in Mo i Rana, Norway. FREYR signed an agreement with HENT AS (“HENT”) for the planning, project management, and construction of FREYR’s 120 thousand square-meter Giga Arctic battery factory. HENT is one of Norway’s largest general contractors and project developers. FREYR also entered into an agreement with Italy based NTE Process (“NTE”) to supply a complete and integrated drying and powder handling system to Giga Arctic. FREYR also awarded an agreement to UK based Mpac Group (“Mpac”) to provide production line equipment for automated casting and unit cell assembly to the Giga Arctic project. Both of these equipment suppliers are pre-qualified vendors of 24M and are currently supplying equipment for the CQP project. 
Material Suppliers
The manufacturing of battery cells requires coordination with a variety of specialized material suppliers, many of which are currently located in Asia. Initially, FREYR expects to rely on qualified suppliers through 24M’s supply chain while embarking on internal qualification of new material providers. Ultimately, FREYR is working to localize its supply 
chain where possible into Europe, and specifically the Nordic region, to supply its CQP and Giga Arctic facilities. FREYR believes that regional raw material supply will expand its low cost, margin, and sustainability advantages by minimizing the distance supplies must travel and ensuring supply chain consistency. FREYR also expects that localized material supply will make it a more attractive trade partner given potential trade policy developments, increased supply chain tracing in Europe and North America, and the logistical challenges of global manufacturing.
In 2022, FREYR took several steps to secure raw materials and the required energy supply for its facilities in Mo i Rana. FREYR signed a long-term physical supply agreement with Statkraft, Europe’s largest producer of renewable energy. The agreement provides a supply of hydropower renewable energy to cover substantially all of FREYR’s currently anticipated electricity needs for the CQP and Giga Arctic facilities during the period of 2023 to 2031 and ensures physical delivery of energy from the central grid in Mo i Rana.
FREYR also announced it had entered into a reservation agreement with Changzhou Senior New Energy Materials Co., Ltd. and Senior Material (Europe) AB (“Changzhou”) to supply battery materials for its CQP and Giga Arctic facilities through 2028, with an optional extension until 2031, exercisable solely by FREYR. Subject to certain terms and conditions of the reservation agreement, Changzhou has reserved the supply capacity of separator materials through 2028 to align with FREYR’s estimated demand. Additionally, FREYR announced a new service agreement with ITOCHU Corporation (“ITOCHU”), the Japan-based global trading and import/export company. As part of this agreement, ITOCHU will serve as a direct materials supplier for FREYR’s procurement and supply chain operations to secure the raw materials required for FREYR’s planned battery production.
Sustainability 
FREYR has a strong commitment towards environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) considerations. International cooperation and outreach related to climate change are increasing focus on sustainability and this is driving a new era of disclosure and accountability across industries and countries. FREYR defines full-cycle sustainability as environmentally-friendly, ethical practices across all aspects of the battery supply chain, from sourcing raw materials upstream to manufacturing to recycling. We have aligned our Company goals with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”), with a focus on the following SDGs:
•Affordable and clean energy;
•Decent work and economic growth;
•Sustainable cities and communities;
•Climate action;
•Industry, innovation, and infrastructure;
•Responsible consumption and production; and
•Partnerships for the goals.
FREYR’s ambition is to support these SDGs and achieve full-cycle sustainability through: 
•Strong Governance - We are committed to instituting best-practice governance policies and procedures to support our sustainability goals. Honesty, integrity, fairness, and respect should be exhibited in all business dealings of FREYR. We promote transparency and accountability grounded on sound business practices. To this end, we have implemented various policies and procedures including an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and a Supplier Code of Conduct. We also have a Whistleblower Program to allow confidential reporting of violations of our policies.
•Securing a Sustainable Supply Chain - FREYR requires that suppliers certify their materials are produced in a responsible manner, outside conflict areas, and under conditions showing due respect to international labor standards and the environment. We are actively engaging with suppliers to develop supply agreements for active materials. European, and especially Nordic-based materials, are preferred, as these are typically manufactured with a lower emissions profile than materials sourced from other regions of the world. In addition to working with suppliers who employ carbon-conscious extraction techniques, a more localized supply chain could also lower carbon emissions by reducing transportation requirements. FREYR’s manufacturing power source for its CQP and Giga Arctic facility will draw primarily from carbon-free hydropower in Mo i Rana.
•Sustainable Operations and Manufacturing of Clean Batteries - The best way that we can support sustainability is through our vision to accelerate the decarbonization of all transportation and energy systems by fulfilling our mission to deliver the world’s most cost effective, efficient, and environmentally friendly batteries. We are strongly dedicated to avoiding and minimizing any adverse environmental impacts linked to our business operations and to promoting emission reduction. This includes adverse impacts as a result of FREYR’s business operations directly, as well as any indirect impacts such as impacts related to business partners and suppliers. Our 24M licensed technology allows for a simplified manufacturing process that reduces material inputs and required energy consumption, lowering the overall carbon footprint. In addition, the design of FREYR’s manufacturing facilities will target zero emissions of toxic substances and other waste from the manufacturing process.
•Human Rights / Health and Safety - We are strongly committed to safeguarding human and labor rights, sound working conditions, working environment, and protecting the health and safety of our employees. FREYR condemns all forms of human rights violations and expects its employees, business partners, and others associated with our business operations to be equally committed to respecting human rights.
