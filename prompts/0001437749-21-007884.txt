Silicon Carbide Ceramic Membranes for Liquid Filtration
 
Under the “LiqTech”, “Cometas” and “Provital” brand names, we manufacture and sell ceramic membranes and systems for liquid filtration using our patented silicon carbide technology (sometimes also referred to herein as our “SiC Filters”). Our current focus is on marine scrubber wash water, contaminated water from the production of hydrocarbons, which we refer to herein as “produced water”, removal of heavy metals in mining and energy applications, pre-filtration for reverse osmosis in drinking water and other industrial applications.
 
Our SiC Filters have been used in the following applications by our clients:
 

● | Marine scrubber wash water: We supply water filtration systems for marine scrubber systems used on ships to reduce sulfur emissions emanating from heavy fuel oil (HFO) operations, allowing vessels to comply with the IMO 2020 sulfur cap. To date, more than 250 water treatment systems have been installed as a result of orders from European and Asian scrubber technology providers, shipyards, and shipowners. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Produced water: Our membrane systems can be used for the filtration of produced water, which is a byproduct of oil and gas production. The amount of produced water varies from 0.1 to 10 times the amount of oil produced. We have performed testing with major international private and public oil and gas companies. Our solution is market-proven, approved by various international oil and gas companies for onshore and offshore applications.
● | Pre-filtration of reverse osmosis drinking water: To convert seawater or surface water into potable water, the seawater or surface water must be pre-filtered before entering the reverse osmosis membranes. We have a market-proven solution that has been tested by various customers around the world. 
● | Industrial applications: We have delivered complete water treatment systems for specific targeted, aggressive fluid applications, such as the removal of heavy metals for energy providers and water treatment systems for mining wastewater. 
● | Producing clean drinking water: In addition to pre-filtration before reverse osmosis described above, the potential advantages of LiqTech SiC ceramic membranes in other drinking water applications are numerous. Some examples include groundwater removal of precipitated salts such as iron and manganese along with surface water removal of organic suspended solids and humic acid. 
● | Pool and spa water: We have supplied several turnkey water filtration systems for medium to very large public swimming pool installations in Europe. We believe our SiC ceramic membranes provide unique advantages for the commercial pool filtration industry with the smallest footprint on the market, reduced water and chemical consumption, and consistent, high-quality water filtration. 

 
Beyond those applications mentioned above utilizing silicon carbide ceramic membranes, LiqTech has developed many other industrial water treatment applications that do not use ceramic membranes. These applications include:
 

● | Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO): SWRO represents a new LiqTech solution to convert seawater into potable water using polymeric membranes. With its high energy efficiency and consistent water quality, we believe SWRO provides one of the most efficient and sustainable solutions to convert seawater into drinkable freshwater. The LiqTech SWRO units are suitable for small commercial vessels, fishing boats, sailing boats, small port applications, and for generally most applications with access to seawater and where desalinated, potable water is needed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Filter Press: The LiqTech Filter Press is a water sludge treatment system, enabling solid and liquid separation. The filter press can convert sludge into a filter cake consisting of up to 80% dry matter, depending on the pressure and application. One of the primary purposes of employing a filter press is to reduce handling costs associated with discharge.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | UV Disinfection: LiqTech is a distributor of UV-C LED Disinfection Systems. This technology can be used to purify water, air, and surfaces to provide reliable and low-cost disinfection to protect human health.

Our SiC membranes are manufactured based on patented technology. We are not aware of other companies that make both the substrate (honeycomb) and the membrane (the surface layer that accomplishes the filtering) solely from silicon carbide. Our products are based on the following silicon carbide membrane technologies:
 

● | CoMem ceramic membranes utilize a unique patented membrane technology designed as a tubular membrane. The membranes utilize a crossflow structure to handle high concentrations of suspended solids found in produced water in the oil & gas and chemical industries, as well as wastewater from industrial processes and manure filtration. It offers consistent removal of oil and suspended solids at high throughput rates regardless of feed conditions. We offer onshore and offshore solutions and have extensive experience with produced water streams for fracking, gas condensate, and oil emulsions. We believe our SiC filters are the better alternative to micro-flotation and walnut shell filters due to cost savings, reduced installation cost, robustness, and decreased downtime. Our chemically inert, plug-and-play membranes are extremely hard, chemically resistant, and durable ceramics with high flux (flow). SiC membranes are stronger, harder, longer-lasting, more temperature-resistant, and recover faster than conventional ceramic or polymeric membranes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Flat sheet membranes (“FSMs”) are designed for sub-merged outside-in filtration applications. The FSM is suitable for wastewater reuse, groundwater, pre reverse osmosis treatment, and other applications. LiqTech’s FSM towers can be customized with different rack sizes and tower heights. The FSMs offer low energy consumption, maximum permeation, innovative rack design, and high flux. These membranes are used in drinking water, pre-RO, and industrial wastewater reuse applications. The FSM carrier and the selective layer are also made of silicon carbide, which gives the product unique advantages such as high flux, total chemical resistance (pH 0-14), long life and one of the lowest fouling tendency of any polymeric or ceramic membrane material;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disc membranes are designed for the removal of high-suspended solids, oil droplets, and process water. The disc membranes use outside-in filtration and have internal permeation channels, facilitating the removal of the solids. A crossflow effect is generated through the discs' rotation at high velocities, which enables flow cleaning of the filter membrane surface. This principle offers 80% energy savings compared to conventional cross-flow systems;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aqua Solution® integrates a dead-end structural design with cutting-edge membrane technology in a solution specifically designed for applications in the pre-treatment for reverse osmosis, wastewater treatment, and swimming pool and spa water filtration. Our Aqua Solution® offers the same water flow as conventional sand filters, which typically require up to 400 times more space and have pore sizes at least three times bigger than our SiC membranes. Moreover, our Aqua Solution® reduces the number of membrane elements, pressure vessels, the water consumption for backwash, and the energy costs by offering high flow capabilities at very low pressure. Also, it eliminates the consumption or maintenance of filter cartridges; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hybrid Technology Membranes (HTM) is a new patented asymmetric membrane that combines the desired properties from silicon carbide (SiC) and zirconia (ZrO₂) ceramics. With a pore size of 60 nanometers (nm), it is suitable for ultrafiltration applications. This state-of-the-art membrane technology facilitates new separation processes and new filtration applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The advantages of our SiC Filters compared to other pre-filtration systems for reverse osmosis are:
 

● | Equivalent water flow to commonly used sand filters that require up to 400 times more space and contain pore sizes that are at least three times larger than our SiC Filters. Additionally, our SiC Filters reduce the number of membrane elements and pressure vessels;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High flow capacities that are achieved at very low pressures, which reduce energy costs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced water consumption for sand filter backwash; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | Elimination of the consumption or maintenance of filter cartridges.

Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) for Gas Purification
 
We offer diesel particulate filters for exhaust emission control solutions to the verified retrofit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market through our direct sales force. DPF sales are generally made to distributors specializing in sales to end users. We use a proprietary “nano washcoat” to provide catalytic coating for anything from diesel particulate filters to catalytic converters. Our DPF products are sold worldwide under the LiqTech brand.
 
We have developed a robust silicon carbide diesel particulate filter that is especially effective for vehicles that produce a high soot load, and if properly maintained, should last as long as the vehicle’s engine. Our DPFs are ideal for off-road vehicles because of their strength, chemical non-reactive nature, temperature resilience and thermal conductivity. 
 
Our DPF filters can handle higher soot loads than filters that do not use a silicon carbide membrane, which makes them ideal for situations in which engines infrequently reach high enough temperatures to burn off soot. Examples include:
 

● | Garbage trucks; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Port vehicles; 
● | Diesel pickup trucks not carrying a full load; 
● | Off-road construction vehicles that idle for long periods of time; and
● | Intra-city vehicles that do not reach highway speeds. 

 
Future tightening legislation in the marine industry has also created a new opportunity for our DPF product to reduce black carbon emissions from shipping.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our sales of DPFs were $5,131,891 and $5,652,685, respectively, and accounted for 23% and 17% of our total sales, respectively.
 
Plastics
 
Plastics have been part of our offering since the acquisiton of BS Plastic A/S on September 4, 2019. LiqTech provides highly flexible and innovative plastics manufacturing, focusing on machining, welding, bending, and solvent cementing. With an intense focus on customer demands, LiqTech serves market leaders in the cleantech, pharma, food, healthcare, and graphics industries.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (4 months), our plastics revenues were $2,647,366 and $895,203, respectively and accounted for 12% and 3% of our total sales, respectively.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
Our products compete with other filters that are made of ceramic and polymeric materials. Most of our competitors are large industrial companies; however, we believe our patented technology allows us to produce high-quality products that provide an advantage over many of our competitors, many of which have greater financial, technological, manufacturing, and personnel resources. We intend to continue to devote resources to developing new technologies and improving our products to reinforce our competitive advantages, retain our existing customers and acquire new customers.
 
We believe the following strengths position us to increase our revenue and profitability:
 

● | Advantages of Silicon Carbide Membranes: Our liquid filtration and diesel exhaust products utilize silicon carbide membranes, which have unique qualities that we believe make our products more effective than those of our competitors. Unlike other filtration products made of aluminum oxide, silicon carbide membranes are chemically inert and temperature resistant. Furthermore, silicon carbide membranes exhibit a high degree of hydrophilicity (the tendency of a surface to become wet or absorb water), which results in unique high flux (and low energy consumption). Silicon carbide is also very durable, and its hardness is only surpassed by diamonds, making it a highly desirable material for various abrasive fluids in industrial applications. As a result, we believe that such superior physical properties make our products desirable in both liquid filtration products and exhaust emission control products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Complete systems fabrication: LiqTech provides full fabrication and integration of our membranes into complete filtration systems made from corrosive-resistant materials and components. We possess in-house engineering capabilities for process design, 3D modeling, and control systems. Our professional staff of highly dedicated engineers and craftsmen take responsibility for the entire specification, engineering, fabrication, and commissioning process. We believe that supplying our customers with turnkey solutions built upon our silicon carbide membranes is unique in the market. LiqTech is more than a membrane supplier — LiqTech is also a supplier of integrated water treatment systems. 
● | Broad Application of LiqTech Membranes: Our membranes can be applied in a variety of applications, including filtration of marine scrubber wastewater, processing of industrial wastewater and produced water, pre-treatment of drinking water, pre-filtration for reverse osmosis, oil emulsion separation, bacteria removal for aquaculture, commercial swimming pool water treatment, ultrafiltration for the food and beverage industry, and the separation of metals from liquids in industrial processes. 
● | Marketing and Manufacturing in Key Markets and Expanding to Other Markets: We have production and sales capacity in Europe. We also sell our products through distributors and agents in many other countries such as China, Korea, Spain, the UK and France. Moreover, we have established customer relationships in more than 25 countries. 
● | Strong and Experienced Management Team: Our management team has deep experience in the clean technology and filtration industries and drives growth through developing new applications and technologies and cultivating relationships with customers.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Focus on the development and sales of standardized water filtration and treatment systems. We will continue our focus on selling systems based on our unique SiC membranes and we will also combine the ceramic membranes with other technologies to offer our customers complete filtration solutions. Moreover, we will continue developing smaller standard systems, like those for groundwater treatment and residential swimming pools.

Our Industry

Overview
 
We serve primarily two industries: the liquid filtration market and the diesel particle filter (DPF) market. Our goal is to leverage our products and technologies into industrial liquid filtration applications that offer significant growth opportunities and take advantage of favorable market trends.
Liquid Filtration Market
 
The market for marine water filtration systems is rapidly evolving due to new regulations for sulfur and ballast water emissions. Industry experts estimate that 4,000 to 6,000 ships will be retrofitted with a scrubber water treatment system over the next five years. At the end of 2019, the industry statistics noted that nearly 4,000 ships have installed or ordered scrubbers (according to the DNV GL report published in March 2020), with most installations being open-loop scrubbers that discharge the wash water directly into the sea. The addressable market for LiqTech is focused on closed-loop scrubbers, where the scrubber wash water is routed through the LiqTech filtration system to remove sulfur and other particulates, and the clean water is then recycled as wash water.
 
As noted above, the use of open-loop scrubbers to clean the exhaust from marine engines that use high-sulfur residual oil and diesel fuels may lead to the discharge of high concentrations of harmful compounds from vessels using such scrubbers. Several trials have been conducted on board vessels by scrubber suppliers to define the constituent concentrations in wash water discharge. The research concluded that scrubber wash water also contains suspended solids, heavy metals, hydrocarbons, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Before the scrubber wash water is discharged, it must be treated to remove solids. LiqTech’s water treatment systems can be used to remove the solids from the wet scrubber wash water. The treatment process includes a pre-filtration step followed by filtration from a LiqTech SiC membrane. Treated water quality is monitored (NTU, PAH, and pH) before discharge. We believe that many of the open-loop scrubbers already installed will eventually be converted to closed-loop (where the LiqTech filtration system is employed), thus resulting in a significantly larger market for LiqTech. The Company is globally engaging with scrubber equipment suppliers, ship owners/operators, and shipyards. Furthermore, we present our water treatment and filtration solutions at marine conferences and trade shows and through digital marketing.
 
In addition to our marine scrubbers, LiqTech offers packaged filtration systems consisting of ceramic SiC and conventional reverse-osmosis (RO) membranes for industrial and municipal customers. We anticipate that global demand will increase for robust products that generate low operating expenses such as ours, especially those that are well-suited for mobile and modular systems. RO membranes are increasingly used to produce drinking water (desalination of seawater or brackish water), demineralized water for industrial processes (boiler feed water, microelectronics production), and food processing and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, many laboratories rely on pure water, for which demineralization is an essential step. LiqTech is differentiated by what we believe is our superior SiC membrane technology and the provision of complete, integrated water treatment systems. According to market reports published by Markets and Markets in October 2020, the market size for membrane technologies in the water industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8%, from $18.5 billion in 2020 to $24.6 billion 2025.
 
Generally, we also expect a growing, global demand for higher-quality re-injection water from unconventional oil and gas productions. In addition, we expect tightening water discharge legislation, increasing water usage (more water produced per barrel of oil), and the introduction of Enhanced Oil Recovery (“EOR”) techniques. The tightening legislation for water discharge can be a problem for conventional treatment and filtration technologies; however, our SiC Filters can mitigate these challenges, and we believe the increasing demand represents a favorable market trend for our business.

Water is essential to life on earth, and clean water shortages are affecting billions of people. Today, 2.2 billion people lack safely managed drinking water, and 3 billion people worldwide lack basic handwashing facilities at home (according to UN Water in June 2019). In addition, more than 700 million people could be displaced due to water scarcity (according to the UN in March 2019). Additionally, according to the World Health Organization, approximately 361,000 children die every year due to unsafe water and lack of basic sanitation. Due to the growing need for pure water for drinking and industrial purposes, the market for water filtration is growing rapidly, with more and larger plants being commissioned all over the world.
 
Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Market
 
The increase in global regulation of diesel engine exhaust particles is expected to drive growth in the DPF market. We expect jurisdictions in the United States to begin requiring DPF filters. In Europe, for example, German cities are setting requirements for off-road machinery to include DPF filters. According to an industry publication (Verified Market Research published in January 2021), the global market for new DPF filters manufactured by OEMs is expected to increase approximately 11% per year from 2020 to 2027 with a value of $11 billion in 2019 to an estimated value of $25 billion in 2027. Diesel emissions consist of several toxic gases and particles: particulate matter (soot), carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons. Soot has been linked to a variety of human health problems. Reducing diesel emissions will have both health and social benefits along with reduced costs.
 
In response to these health impacts, governments have been implementing legislation to regulate emissions from diesel engines. California implemented the Diesel Risk Reduction Plan, and New York City implemented binding directives for the retrofitting of buses, garbage trucks, and construction machines. In the European Union, Directive EC 715/2007 of June 20, 2007 defines particle count limits for certain cars and light utility vehicles. Also, low emission zones have been implemented locally in various places in Europe, creating a patchwork of regulation.
 
The Asian markets have shown an improved standard of living due to financial growth, which has led to increased sales of vehicles in the region. At the same time, pollution in major cities has reached high (more than 2.5) levels of particulate matters. As a result, the Chinese government has introduced additional regulations, including new emissions standards, faster than previously anticipated. We also believe that high pollution levels will increase the need for the retrofit of existing vehicles.
 
Research and Development
 
We have fourteen (14) full-time employees that are primarily engaged in research and development activity. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we spent $1,278,331 and $749,249, respectively, on research and development.
Manufacturing
 
We currently manufacture our DPF and membrane products in facilities located in Ballerup, Denmark. We assemble our water treatment systems in Hobro, Denmark. In 2019, we acquired BS Plastic A/S (now called LiqTech Plastics) that manufactures its plastic products in facilities located in Aarhus, Denmark. We are planning to expand our production capacity, primarily through investment in additional equipment for our liquid filtration products.
Raw Materials
 
The main raw materials that we use in our manufacturing processes are silicon carbide, steel, plastic, platinum, and palladium. We purchase these commodities from various sources generally based upon availability and price.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

Our products are sold primarily to large industrial customers for gas and liquid filtration. The Company sells through direct sales, systems integrators, distributors, agents, and partners. 
 
The Company initially focused on selling its DPF filters to the automotive industry. In 2014, we acquired LiqTech Water (previously named LiqTech Systems and Provital Solutions), a Danish manufacturing company focused on filtration systems, which enabled us to shift our focus to providing complete, modular liquid filtration systems. The Company’s liquid filtration systems business now serves the marine industry; other industrial applications in mining, power generation, aquaculture and oil and gas; and non-industrial applications such as swimming pools, water reclamation and municipal drinking water. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our four largest customers accounted for approximately 27%, 10%, 8% and 8% of our net sales (approximately 53% in total). For the year ended December 31, 2019, our four largest customers accounted for approximately 29%, 18%, 15% and 7% of our net sales (approximately 68% in total). If we are unable to diversify our customer base, our future results will be heavily dependent on these same customers. 
 
We plan to actively market our existing products to new customers as we increase our production capacity. As of March 2021, we employed eighteen (18) full-time salespeople in addition to distribution agents. We promote our products through direct sales to potential customers and marketing activities such as participation in tradeshows and exhibitions.
 
In certain instances, our products are delivered to the end customer through systems integrators. These systems integrators use our filtration products in larger filtration systems, which eventually are installed in products used by the end customer. Due to legislative regulation, systems integrators are often required by end customers to receive approval for their systems, including the components used in such systems, which requires significant time and expense. As a result, we believe that certain of the systems integrators that use our products will not replace our filters with competitive products unless there are compelling reasons.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have one issued patent in the United States that we co-own with a third party, two issued patents in Denmark, five issued foreign patents (Germany, China and South Korea) that we co-own with a third party, and two pending European patent applications that we co-own with third parties. The U.S. patent that we co-own is generally effective for 20 years from the filing date (July 8, 2004) of the earliest U.S. or international application to which it claims priority. The scope and duration of each of our foreign patents varies in accordance with local law.
Government Regulation
 
We do not believe that we are subject to any special governmental regulations affecting our products in the countries in which we operate. We are subject to numerous health and safety laws and regulations. In the United States, these laws and regulations include the Federal Occupation Safety and Health Act and comparable state legislation. We are also subject to similar requirements in other countries in which we have extensive operations, including Denmark. We actively seek to maintain a safe, healthy and environmentally friendly workplace for all of our employees and other stakeholders.
 
  8 

  

Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the handling, storage, disposal, and release of waste and hazardous substances. It is our policy to comply with all applicable environmental requirements at each of our facilities. We are subject to similar requirements in Denmark and other European countries. From time to time, we have identified minor environmental compliance issues at our facilities. To date, compliance with environmental matters has not had a material effect upon the Company’s capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position.
 
We believe that, due to the constant focus on the environment and clean air and clean water standards throughout the world, more stringent regulations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere around the world are likely as governmental agencies seek to improve standards required for certification of products intended to promote clean air and water. In the event our products fail to meet these changing standards, some or all our products may become obsolete, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and long-term prospects.
 
Competition

Our products compete with other filters that are made using both ceramic and plastic membranes. Most of our competitors are large industrial companies; however, we believe our patented technology, manufacturing know-how, and trade secrets allow us to produce high-quality products that provide an advantage over many of our competitors, many of which have greater financial, technological, manufacturing and personnel resources. We intend to continue to devote resources to the development of new technologies and the improvement of our products to retain existing customers and acquire new customers.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2020 we had 114 employees, 112 of whom were full-time employees. We have 109 employees in Denmark, including 64 in production, 13 in administration, 14 in research and development, 16 in sales and engineering and two in executive management. At December 31, 2020 we also had 5 accounting and production employees remaining in the United States, where we recently ceased operations and the last employee left the Company at the end of January 2021.
 
Certain employees in Denmark are represented by workers’ councils that have collective bargaining agreements. With the exception of such Danish employees, no other employees are members of a labor union or are represented by workers’ councils that have collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
