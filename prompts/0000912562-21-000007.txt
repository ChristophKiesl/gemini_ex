Item 1. | Business

The Company
Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading manufacturer and provider of products and services for the renewable energy, conservation, residential and infrastructure markets. Gibraltar’s mission is to create compounding and sustainable value for our shareholders and stakeholders with strong and relevant leadership positions in higher growth, profitable end markets focused on addressing some of the world's most challenging opportunities. The foundation of the Company's strategy is built on three core pillars: Business System, Portfolio Management, and Organization Development. 
1.Business System reflects the necessary systems, processes, and management tools required to deliver consistent and continuous performance improvement, every day. Our business system is a critical enabler to grow, scale, and deliver our plans. Our business system is focused on deploying effective tools to drive growth, improve operating performance, and develop the organization. Our Business System challenges existing paradigms, drives day-to-day performance, forces prioritization of resources, challenges our business models, and brings focus to new product and services development and innovation.
2.Portfolio Management is focused on optimizing the Company’s business portfolio and ensures our financial capital and human resources are effectively and efficiently deployed to deliver sustainable, profitable growth while increasing our relevance with customers and shaping our markets. In 2020, the Company transacted the following acquisitions:
•Thermo Energy Systems ("Thermo) - January 2020, 
•Delta Separations (“Delta”) - February 2020
•Architectural Mailboxes - October 2020
•Sunfig Corporation - December 2020
•TerraSmart LLC ("TerraSmart") - December 2020 
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company made the decision to classify its Industrial business as held for sale and report its results as discontinued operations. 
3.Organization Development drives the Company’s continuous focus on strengthening and scaling the organization to execute the Company’s plans and meet commitments. The Company aspires to make our place of work the "Best Place to Work", where we focus on creating an environment for our people to have the best opportunity for success, continue to develop, grow, and learn. At core of this pillar is the Company’s development process focused on helping employees reach their potential, improve performance, develop career roadmaps, identify ongoing education requirements, and respective succession plans. We believe doing so helps us attract and retain the best people so we can execute our business plans. 
COVID-19 Update
While the Company continues to encounter challenges and uncertainty associated with COVID-19, the pandemic did not have a material adverse effect on our reported results during 2020. While most of our operations have been considered essential businesses and all have remained open during the pandemic outside of a few days, the decision to keep our team intact despite some initial market softness for certain businesses put us in a position to deliver revenue and earnings growth throughout 2020. Our top priority continues to be focused on our organization - keeping our team and their families as safe as possible, our supply chain operating well, and providing a high level of responsiveness to customer needs. We will continue to proactively execute our pandemic “playbook” as we enter 2021 and make adjustments to our operating protocols as navigate forward. The extent to which our operations will be impacted by the outbreak will largely depend on future developments, which remain uncertain and challenging to predict, including new requirements or regulations mandated by government authorities. Refer to the Company's Outlook section in this management discussion and analysis for consideration relative to future periods.

Customers and Products
Our customers are located primarily throughout North America. One customer, a home improvement retailer which purchases from both the Residential Products segment and Renewable Energy and Conservation segment, represented 14% of our consolidated net sales for each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. No other customer in any segment or segments accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales.
Our products are primarily distributed to our customers using common carriers. We maintain distribution centers that complement our manufacturing plants from which we ship products and ensure on-time delivery while maintaining efficiency within our distribution system. Our customers and product offerings by segment are described below. 
Renewable Energy and Conservation
The Renewable Energy and Conservation segment is primarily a designer and manufacturer of fully-engineered solutions for solar mounting systems, greenhouse structures and botanical oil extraction systems. This segment offers a fully integrated approach to the design, engineering, manufacturing and installation of solar racking systems, including electrical balance of systems, and commercial, institutional, and retail greenhouse structures servicing customers, such as community solar owners and developers, organic produce growers, retail garden centers, conservatories and botanical gardens, floriculture growers, agricultural research, and botanical oil processors. With the recently announced acquisitions of TerraSmart and Sunfig, we have 13 manufacturing facilities and 2 distribution centers and operate in the United States, China and Japan. 
An integral part of solar racking and greenhouse projects is the fabrication of specifically designed metal structures for highly-engineered applications including: racking and foundation for ground-mounted solar arrays on any type of terrain; single-axis solar tracker solutions; carports that integrate solar PV panels; as well as commercial-scale greenhouses and other glass structures. Both the solar racking and greenhouse projects involve securing glass and plastic to metal and use the same raw materials including steel and aluminum. Most of our production is completed using computer numerical control machines, roll forming machines, laser cutters and other fabrication tools. The structural metal components are designed, engineered, fabricated and installed in accordance with applicable building codes.
We strive to improve our offerings of products by introducing new products, enhancing existing products, adjusting product specifications to respond to commercial building codes and regulatory changes, and providing solutions to contractors and end users. New products introduced in recent years include screw-based racking solutions, software solutions to optimize solar energy investments, botanical oil extraction systems, single-axis tracker systems, metal framed structures for car washes, and solar racking systems for carports and canopies. Our screw-based racking solutions offer rapid installation on any terrain. Our new software solution enables our team to optimize solar project design, utilizing solar irradiance data and topography analysis to quickly and automatically generate multiple potential layouts for complex projects Our botanical oil extraction systems provide equipment for extracting plant oils for hemp, cannabis, and nutraceutical processors. The single-axis tracker systems within our solar mounting solutions group provide flexibility to adapt to a variety of site conditions that impact tracker site designs when using other solutions in the market and can vastly reduce the costs associated with civil work on projects. The patented design eliminates complexities incorporated in the traditional systems, simplifying the operations and maintenance of the system, along with streamlining the installation process. Our car washes serve a market preference for light- transparent structures. Solar racking systems for carports serve as protection for cars from the effects of the sun and intense heat while providing a renewable energy source. Similarly, solar racking systems installed on idle land, such as solid waste landfills, or on challenging, rocky terrain, converts such land into a useful property by providing clean renewable power generating capabilities.
Residential Products
Our Residential Products segment services the residential repair and remodeling and to a lesser extent the new housing construction markets in North America with products including roof and foundation ventilation products, centralized mail systems and electronic package solutions, outdoor living products (retractable sun-shades), rain dispersion products and other construction accessories. Our residential product offerings are sold through a number of sales channels including major retail home centers, building material wholesalers, building product distributors, buying groups, roofing distributors, residential contractors, property management companies and postal services distributors and providers. This segment operates 12 manufacturing facilities throughout the United States, giving it a base of operations to provide manufacturing capability of high quality products, customer service, delivery and technical support to a broad network of regional and national customers across North America.
Our roof and foundation ventilation products and accessories include solar powered units. Our centralized mail and electronic package solutions include single mailboxes, cluster style mail and parcel boxes for single and multi-family housing and electronic package locker systems. Our remaining residential product offerings consist of roof edging and flashing, soffits and trim, drywall corner bead, metal roofing and accessories, rain dispersion products, including gutters and accessories, and exterior retractable awnings. Each of these product offerings can be sold separately or as part of a system solution.
Within our Residential Products businesses, we are constantly striving to improve our product/solution offerings by introducing new products, enhancing existing products, adapting to building code and regulatory changes, and providing new and innovative solutions to homeowners and contractors. New products introduced in recent years include electronic parcel lockers, roof top safety kits, chimney caps, heat trace coils, exterior, remote-controlled 
deck awnings for sun protection, and high-efficiency and solar-powered ventilation products. Our electronic parcel lockers and parcel room systems provide residents in multi-family communities a secure storage receptacle to handle both package deliveries and receipt of other delivered goods, along with aiding retail businesses and their customers to transact via buy on line, pick up in store ("BOPUS") transactions. Our ventilation and roof flashing products provide protection and extend the life of structures while providing a safer, healthier environment for residents. Our cluster box mail delivery products provide delivery cost savings to the postal service while offering secure storage for delivered mail and packages. Our building products are manufactured primarily from galvanized and painted steel, anodized and painted aluminum, and various resins.
Within our manufacturing facilities, we leverage significant production capabilities which allow us to both assemble and process a wide range of metals and plastics for our residential products. Most of our production is completed using automatic roll forming machines, stamping presses, welding, paint lines, and injection molding equipment. We maintain our equipment according to a thorough preventive maintenance program allowing us to meet the demanding quality and delivery requirements of our customers. In some cases, the Company sources products from third-party vendors to optimize cost and quality in order to provide the very best and affordable solution for our customers.
Infrastructure Products
Our Infrastructure Products segment primarily serves end markets such as highway and bridge construction and airports through commercial and transportation contractors. Our infrastructure product offerings include expansion joints, structural bearings, rubber pre-formed seals and other sealants, elastomeric concrete, and bridge cable protection systems. We operate two manufacturing facilities in the United States giving us a base of operations to provide customer support, delivery, service, and quality to a number of regional and national customers, and providing us with manufacturing and distribution efficiencies in North America. 
We strive to improve our offerings of infrastructure products by introducing new products, enhancing existing products, adjusting product specifications to respond to regulatory changes, and providing additional solutions to contractors. New products have been introduced in recent years by extending our transportation infrastructure products into new markets. For example, our long-lasting pavement sealants for roadways are now being installed on airport runways internationally, our structural bearings for elevated highways and bridges have been installed on an offshore oil production platform, and our corrosion-protection products for cable-suspension bridges are now marketed and sold internationally.
Engineering and Technical Services
Our business segments employ engineers and other technical personnel to perform a variety of key tasks which include the identification and implementation of improvements to our manufacturing process, redesign of our products for better performance, the development of new products and identification and execution of cost reduction activities. In addition, our engineering staff employs a range of drafting software to design highly specialized and technically precise products. In our Renewable Energy and Conservation and Infrastructure Products segments, drawings are approved and stamped by state licensed professional engineers. Technical service personnel also work in conjunction with our sales force in the new product development process to determine the types of products and services that suit the particular needs of our customers.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
Our business is required to maintain sufficient quantities of raw material inventory in order to accommodate our customers’ short lead times. Accordingly, we plan our purchases to maintain raw materials at sufficient levels to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers. We have implemented enterprise resource planning systems along with a corporate wide SIOP (Sales, Inventory, Operations Planning process) to better manage our inventory, forecast customer orders, enable efficient supply chain management, and allow for more timely counter-measures to changing customer demand and market conditions.
The primary raw materials we purchase are flat-rolled and plate steel, aluminum coil and extrusions, and resins. We purchase flat-rolled and plate steel and aluminum at regular intervals on an as-needed basis, primarily from the major North American mills, as well as, a limited amount from domestic service centers and foreign steel importers. Substantially all of our resins are purchased from domestic vendors, primarily through distributors, with a small amount purchased directly from manufacturers. Supply has historically been adequate from these sources to fulfill our needs. Because of our strategy to develop longstanding relationships in our supply chain, we have been able to 
adjust our deliveries of raw materials to match our required inventory positions to support our on-time deliveries to customers while allowing us to manage our investment in inventory and working capital. Management continually evaluates improvements in our purchasing practices across our geographically dispersed facilities in order to streamline purchasing across similar commodities.
We purchase natural gas and electricity from suppliers in proximity to our operations.
Intellectual Property
We actively protect our proprietary rights by the use of trademark, copyright, and patent registrations. While we do not believe that any individual item of our intellectual property is material, we believe our trademarks, copyrights, and patents provide us with a competitive advantage when marketing our products to customers. We also believe our brands are well recognized in the markets we serve and we believe they stand for high-quality manufactured goods at a competitive price. These trademarks, copyrights, and patent registrations help us maintain product leadership positions for the goods we offer. In 2020, 8% of our annual revenues were generated from patented products.
Sales and Marketing
In 2020, approximately 54% of our revenues were generated from products and services that were sold directly to the end user, with the remainder of revenues generated through retailers, wholesalers and distributors, slightly up from 53% in 2019. Continual communication with our customers allows us to understand their challenges and provides us with the opportunity to identify solutions that will meet their needs. We have organized sales teams to focus on specific customers and national accounts through which we provide enhanced solutions and improve our ability to increase the relevance of products and services that we sell. Our sales regularly involve competitive bidding processes, and our reputation for meeting delivery requirements and strict specifications make us a preferred provider for many customers.
Our sales staff works with certain retail customers to optimize shelf space for our products which is expected to increase sales at these locations. Our retail customers are provided with point-of-sale marketing aids to encourage consumer spending on our products in their stores. We focus on providing our customers with industry leading customer service. We are able to meet our customers’ demand requirements due to our efficient manufacturing processes and extensive distribution network.
Backlog
Backlog represents the value of the total confirmed orders at a point in time for which performance obligations have not yet been satisfied. This metric is useful as it represents the aggregate amount we expect to recognize as revenue in the future. 
While the majority of our products have short lead time order cycles, we had aggregated approximately $297 million of backlog from continuing operations at December 31, 2020 compared to $198 million at December 31, 2019. The backlog primarily relates to certain business units in our Renewable Energy and Conservation and our Infrastructure segments. We believe that the majority of our backlog will be shipped, completed and installed during 2021.
Competition
The Company operates in highly competitive markets. We compete against several competitors in all three of our segments with different competitors in each major product category. We compete with competitors based on the range of products offered, quality, price, and delivery, as well as serving as a full service provider for project management in certain segments. Although some of our competitors are large companies, the majority are small to medium-sized and do not offer the large range of products that we offer.
We believe our broad range of products, high quality, and sustained ability to meet exacting customer delivery requirements gives us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors. We also believe that execution of our business strategy further differentiates us from many of our competitors and allows us to capitalize on those areas that give us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors. 
Seasonality
The Company’s business has historically been subjected to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and third quarters. General economic forces, such as tax credit expirations and imposed tariffs, along with changes in the Company’s products and customer mix have shifted traditional seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years.
Governmental Regulation
Our production processes involve the use of environmentally regulated materials. We believe that we operate our business in material compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, and do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations. However, we could incur operating costs or capital expenditures in complying with new or more stringent environmental requirements in the future or with current requirements if they are applied to our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers in a way we do not anticipate. In addition, new or more stringent regulation of our energy suppliers could cause them to increase the price of energy.
Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations covering our labor relationships, the import and export of goods, the zoning of our facilities, taxes, our general business practices, and other matters. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
Human Capital - Organization Development
Gibraltar is built on three strategic pillars – a strong business system, the optimization of our portfolio of businesses, and continuous organizational development. Advancing each pillar is critical to ensuring we deliver our commitments to our people, our shareholders, our stakeholders, and our communities. The foundation for organizational development is built on two fundamental beliefs:
1.Our ability to perform and deliver shareholder value is dependent on our people, and
2.We strive to create an environment where our people can have the best chance for success and we refer to this internally as creating the "Best Place to Work."
Our "Best Place to Work" initiative is built on the following six tenets, and involves our entire organization:
1.Health and Safety
2.Education and Development
3.Diversity, Equality and Inclusion
4.Corporate Social Responsibility
5.Compensation and Employee Benefits
6.Communication and Employee Engagement
We employed 2,319 full-time employees and 18 part-time employees as of December 31, 2020. Of our 2,337 total employees, 939 were classified as salary and 1,398 classified as hourly. We also employed approximately 619 full-time equivalent temporary agency employees. 
Health and Safety
We expect each member of Gibraltar to follow our safety standards and practices, support our key safety initiatives, be accountable to each other, and always be part of the solution. We believe all accidents and near-misses are preventable. Additionally, we measure and review our safety results continuously in each location.
We have a disciplined safety management and reporting process. Our CEO reviews safety performance, including recordable incidents, near misses, and first aid cases monthly with all business and human resource leaders. In addition, safety performance and best practices are also reviewed quarterly with the entire organization during our organization-wide Town Hall live virtual meetings. Additionally, as part of our annual budget and capital planning process, our businesses identify additional safety investments required for training, education, equipment, and processes.
Our safety performance improved in 2020, and we remain focused on continuing positive progress in 2021. We measure safety performance on three metrics - Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), Near Misses, and First Aid events. 
•TRIR is defined as the number of work-related injuries or illness serious enough to require treatment beyond first aid, per 200,000 hours worked. 
•Near Misses are defined as an incident in which no personal injury occurred, but personal injury could have occurred but for a slight circumstantial shift. 
•First Aid events are defined as medical attention that is administered immediately after an injury or sudden illness occurs and at the location where it occurred. 
In 2020, we worked 4,874,000 hours, an increase of an 548,000 workforce hours, or 12.7% increase versus 2019. Increase in workforce hour is primarily due to our acquisitions of Thermo, Delta Separation, Architectural Mailboxes and Apeks, as well as an overall increase in our workforce from 2019. Our TRIR rate improved 37% from 3.7 TRIR to 2.3 TRIR, with recordable incidents down 29% and first-aid events up 18%, respectively. In addition, we did not have any work-related fatalities in 2020, nor any in recent years.
Operating during the COVID-19 pandemic required focus, discipline, and diligence from our entire organization to maintain our COVID health and safety protocols—while at work, home, and in the communities where we live and work. Beginning in March 2020 and to date, we implemented:
•All Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) recommendations and educational initiatives. Additionally, we proactively tracked and implemented all state and local mandates and made modifications in compliance with changes throughout the year. 
•Travel restrictions and leveraging of digital tools as much as possible.
•Operating protocols in our offices and production facilities including mandatory PPE (face masks / shields, and sanitizer stations), social distancing requirements, zone management, shift management, temperature checks, visitor restrictions, and sanitization management with outside contractors.
•Business continuity protocols for our remote-working team with focus on reliable, consistent, and continuous connectivity along with additional cyber-security protection and a new centralized Help Desk.
•Temporary conversions of two manufacturing facilities to produce face masks and shields for all Gibraltar employees and their family members. We also produced hand sanitizer for all Gibraltar locations and healthcare facilities and first responders in our local communities.
•160 hours of additional pay for our production employees to be used at their discretion during the year to support them, and their families, in the event the pandemic caused personal hardship. In December 2020, we paid a cash bonus to each production employee for the unused portion of their remaining 160 hours. For non-production employees, who positions were generally able to be performed remotely, we provided salary continuation for time needed to deal with personal matters arising from the pandemic.
•Daily, weekly, and monthly communications to keep our team informed as the pandemic and our business situation evolved throughout the year. In 2020, the CEO hosted 18 live "Town Hall" virtual meetings connecting with as many as 650 people to provide updates and address any concerns from the team. The executive leadership team, business leaders, and human resource leaders met daily and weekly to modify and implement changes to our operating protocols.
•Processes to track COVID-19 cases across Gibraltar by location and for our employees working remotely. The leadership team reviewed our status every 24 to 48 hours. We also tracked the recovery process for all employees and our “active” cases throughout the year. 
Education and Development
We support our employees in realizing their full potential with meaningful career development opportunities. Our focus is to build the best organization and an environment where our employees learn, are challenged, and have the tools to grow. We are also focused on building the most effective systems, tools and processes to enable the organization to continue to advance. With these initiatives, along with our formal education and development program, we will build competencies, drive more diversity of thought, challenge internal paradigms, and drive improved and consistent performance.
The development of our organization starts with consistent education and training. At the core of this effort is making sure our people have a foundation based in Ethics and Compliance, which is summarized as follows:
•Our commitment to high ethical standards is the best way to serve our people, customers, suppliers, and investors;
•We are all responsible to follow and uphold strong ethical principles;
•Ethical behavior is more than a policy and compliance with the law is mandatory—it is our responsibility to do business in the right and responsible way.
Our commitment to living our values includes providing education and training for everyone, and as part of our continued commitment, we have updated our Code of Ethics and expanded our ethics training curriculum.
In 2019, we developed a comprehensive education curriculum including Ethics – “Doing the Right Thing,” Compliance – “Doing It the Right and Responsible Way,” and Cyber Security. Our curriculum is administered online and every employee and member of the Board of Directors is required to complete a minimum of 12.5 hours per year in an assigned timeframe. In 2020, we invested approximately 20,000 hours in education and training and our goal on a full-year basis is to invest at least 25,000 hours. Our education program, completed annually by all employees, is a condition of employment, and our CEO reviews the quarterly progress for all employees. The base curriculum is summarized below.

Ethics | Compliance | Cyber Security 
“Do the Right Thing”•Ethics and Ethical Behavior•Harassment and Discrimination•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion–Unconscious and Implicit Bias–Micro-Aggressions–Respect in the Workplace–Cultural Competency•Corporate Social Responsibility•Conflict of Interest | “Do It the Right and Responsible Way”•Insider Trading•Intellectual Property•Anti-Trust and Fair Competition•Government Relations•Improper Payments and Gifts•Data Privacy and Protection•International Business Ethics•U.S. Employment Law for Supervisors | •Business Continuity•Security Awareness•Internet Security When Working from Home•Social Engineering, Phishing, and Ransomware•Mobile Security•Stop and Stop the Spread of Disinformation•Identity Theft

We also developed and launched Gibraltar University in 2019, which is designed to develop our leadership across Gibraltar. The program is a two-year initiative utilizing classroom education, ongoing continuous learning, and team project implementation prior to graduation. The curriculum covers Finance, Human Resources, Marketing, Operations, Innovation, Legal, Strategy Development and Deployment, and Mergers & Acquisitions, and is taught by Gibraltar’s leadership team. In January 2020, our first class of 40 participants, nominated by our business leaders, started the program and will graduate in December 2021. Our second class will be selected in June 2021 and will start the program in January 2022.
In 2019, we piloted our Organization Planning and Talent Review process, and subsequently implemented it across Gibraltar in 2020. The annual process integrates discussions and metrics on organization design/structure, career development, diversity, equality and inclusion, performance and potential assessment, and succession planning. Each business unit reviews their organizational development plans with our CEO and executive leadership team and follows with monthly reviews to ensure implementation of organization plans. On an annual basis, our CEO reviews the organizational development plan and performance results with the Board of Directors including performance of the executive team, succession planning progress, key organizational priorities and results, education and training initiatives, and all key organizational design and structure.
This annual process helps our organization scale and manage the future of the company. The process reinforces the development requirements and opportunities for our people, and ensures we are addressing organization gaps/opportunities and succession planning in a continuous and timely manner. It also drives our annual hiring, recruiting, and retention initiatives, and in 2020, it was instrumental as we added significant talent across our organization.
Recruiting is an important aspect of our business strategy and is guided by our desire to find the best talent to drive our business and build our “Best Place to Work” vision. It starts with understanding our organizational needs and developing diverse candidate “slates” for the positions we plan to hire. Our search process is based on personal engagement, and utilizes digital tools and channels, intelligent software and analytics, and competency assessment tools.
Recruiting is also about telling our story better – communicating our “Best Place to Work” vision using social media to reach a broader audience, and strengthening our partnerships with selected professional recruiters, labor agencies, universities, and trade schools. Our apprentice, co-op and internship programs continue to grow and this creates an opportunity for potential candidates to assess the fit and opportunity within our organization over time.
Diversity, Equality and Inclusion
We support and encourage a culture where diversity of thought flourishes, and all employees feel appreciated, included, and know they have an equal opportunity to develop, grow, and succeed based on their performance. We believe demonstrating respect for our people and valuing them for who they are, their perspectives, and their contributions is critical to creating the best environment for our team to have success. This is foundational for our “Best Place to Work.”

In 2020, over 50% of our employees hired were classified as diverse. We are building a team with people who bring diversity of thought, experience, and perspective to our organization. We recognize our organization and the communities we operate in will continue to evolve and grow, which will require we remain focused on the following initiatives:
•Continue our mandatory and annual education and development program for the entire Company, including the Board of Directors, and evolve the curriculum as needed;
•Continue to “map” our organization with the communities we operate in to ensure the make-up of our team is reasonably representative of the community itself;
•Implement and upgrade business systems across the Company to give us the capability to gather and analyze data, derive conclusions, and develop action plans for implementation;
•Communicate our progress utilizing monthly business reviews with the leadership teams, and through quarterly communications with our teams, and quarterly reviews with the Board of Directors;
•Build the most effective recruitment framework to attract the best talent with the following objectives: 
1.Build diversity of thought requirements into our recruiting process with our partner recruitment firms and labor agencies, universities and trade schools, and ensure they deliver diverse slates of candidates for our hiring needs; and
2.Strengthen our outreach effort to build and broaden our opportunity for diverse talent--to include academic institutions, industry associations, local businesses, and affinity groups
•Be proactive with our customers and supply chain partners to find ways to work together in promoting positive social development.
Corporate Social Responsibility
The Board of Directors and the entire Gibraltar team are committed to improving and positively impacting the global environment, social development, and business governance. We believe in doing business the right and most responsible way is foundational in executing and accelerating our vision and strategy. Our efforts continue to focus on our People, our Communities, and the World.

Our People | Our Communities | The World 
To be sustainable andresponsible through theadvancement of our health andwelfare programs; putting thesafety and well-being of ourpeople before anything else;supporting professional growthand developing our futureleaders; and supporting diversityand inclusion. | By contributing to communitieswhere we do business and whereour people live and work;supporting these communitiesthrough charitable donations; andsponsoring volunteerism. | Operating responsibly in theworld by focusing on measuring,managing and reducing ourenvironmental footprint, andpromoting responsibility acrossour value chain.

There are three strategic tenets that drive our focus on corporate social responsibility:
1.Center our business portfolio on industries that are solving some of the world’s most important challenges – energy production, growing food, and home efficiency;
2.Invest and commit to improving our own operations – reducing greenhouse emissions through effective and efficient energy technologies, improving our energy efficiency, and sourcing more renewable energy for our power requirements; and
3.Invest in the communities where our people live and work.
Gibraltar continues to transition its portfolio to focus on markets and businesses that are positioned to solve some of our world’s most critical challenges. As of December 31, 2020, over 50% of our businesses were focused on driving environmentally-sound solutions in energy production, growing food, and home efficiency. A representative example of this day-to-day effort is reflected in the Renewables and Conservation business.
•Since 2015, our Renewables business has installed over 2,500 solar energy fields across the U.S., offsetting more than 4 million metric tons of CO² equivalent. We acquired TerraSmart on December 31, 2020, a leading solar technology business, to help us accelerate our vision to make solar energy the best overall energy solution to power the future. In 2021, we plan to install Gibraltar’s first solar field to provide 100% of the electricity requirements of a key manufacturing facility.
•Our Conservation business is the largest North American based commercial greenhouse solutions provider, with over 3,000 acres of controlled-environment commercial growing installed in North America. The business is focused on localizing the growing of fruits and vegetables, cannabis, flowers, and plants in a controlled environment utilizing natural sunlight, optimal water supply, and without pesticides. We enable improved crop yield, food quality, and the overall health of consumers.
Across Gibraltar, we remain focused on contributing to the reduction of greenhouse emissions by deploying more effective and efficient ways in managing our operations, reducing the amount of power we consume, and identifying opportunities to source renewable energy for our power requirements. We have partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Plants Program to improve energy efficiency and competitiveness at our operations and have also partnered with a global energy company to help us automate the identification and collection our emissions data. These efforts will help us develop first company-wide sustainability report and establish a scientific-based carbon reduction plan and commitment for the future.
The health and well-being of the communities we operate in is important to everyone across our organization. We continue to support many local charities with funding, time and talent, with a focus on improving the health and education of children. In 2019, we launched our first employee giving program and employee donations made to St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital, the Ronald MacDonald House, or Habitat for Humanity were supported with a 100% match from the company. In 2020, we expanded our giving program to include food banks located in our communities. Our employees donated over 3.3 million meals, approximately 85,000 meals for each food bank. Gibraltar continues to be an advocate and supporter of our Veterans, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and the United Way.
Compensation and Employee Benefits
Our compensation and benefits package is a key factor in recruiting and retaining the best talent in our industry. Our employee health and welfare benefits program is designed to promote the overall health of our workforce. While specific benefits vary worldwide and are based on regional practices, listed below are some common features offered to our United States based employees, which at December 31, 2020 comprised approximately 91% of our employees:

• Medical, dental and vision benefits for employee, spouse and dependents | • Wellness incentives for employees
• Flexible spending accounts for both healthcare and dependent care | • Life insurance benefits 
• 401(k) retirement savings program with company matching contributions | • Employee assistance program 
• Paid vacation and holidays | • Parental leave 
• Short-term and long-term disability benefits | 

In addition, all salaried employees receive a written performance appraisal on an annual basis. We review compensation at least annually for all employees and adjust it to ensure we reward exceptional performance and remain competitive in the market. We also offer a target-based incentive plan that provides for annual bonus opportunity when certain company financial metrics are met.
Communication and Employee Engagement
Gibraltar recognizes the importance of engaging employees through consistent and continuous communication such that the team clearly understands the Company's vision, strategy, and key priorities. Every quarter, our CEO conducts a live "Town Hall" meeting for the entire organization with a standard agenda reviewing ethics and compliance, safety performance, business performance, community service initiatives, employee recognition, and concludes with a live Questions & Answers session. After each Town Hall meeting, our team is surveyed for feedback on ways to improve the meeting. As well, each Gibraltar business leader is required to develop and execute a similar communication plan for their business. In 2020, we also conducted an employee engagement survey to solicit input about our brand, company reputation, and culture. The results of the survey will contribute to Gibraltar's brand assessment initiative as well as further strengthen our internal communication process. Ultimately, 
creating a "Best Place to Work" environment requires continuous and effective engagement and communication with our employees, and it also creates a strong foundation for attracting and retaining our team.
