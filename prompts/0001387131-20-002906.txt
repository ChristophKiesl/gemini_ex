--------+---------

Overview
 
Cypress Environmental Partners, L.P. (formerly Cypress Energy Partners, L.P.) (“we”, “us”, “our”, the “Partnership”) is a Delaware limited partnership formed on September 19, 2013. Our suite of services includes inspection, testing, recycling, survey, water treatment, and other environmental services that help our customers protect people, property, infrastructure, and the environment with a focus on safety and sustainability. We work closely with our customers to help them protect the environment, property, and people. Our services also help our clients comply with increasingly complex federal and state environmental and safety rules and regulations. The substantial majority of our environmental services are required services under various federal and state laws. Trading of our common units began January 15, 2014 on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CELP”.
 
Our business is organized into three reportable segments: (1) Pipeline Inspection Services (“Pipeline Inspection”), comprising the TIR Entities’ operations, (2) Pipeline & Process Services (“Pipeline & Process Services”), made up of Brown’s operations and (3) Water and Environmental Services (“Environmental Services”), constituting water treatment activities in our water treatment entities.  Other potential lines of business outlined in U.S. Treasury Regulations and our Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) private letter ruling (“PLR”) would allow us to further diversify our business lines and activities.
 
 The Pipeline Inspection segment generates revenue primarily by providing essential environmental services including inspection and integrity services on a variety of infrastructure assets including midstream pipelines, gathering systems, and distribution systems. Services include nondestructive examination, in-line inspection support, pig tracking, survey, data gathering, and supervision of third-party contractors. Our results in this segment are driven primarily by the number of inspectors that perform services for our customers and the fees that we charge for those services, which depend on the type, skills, technology, equipment, and number of inspectors used on a particular project, the nature of the project, and the duration of the project. The number of inspectors engaged on projects is driven by the type of project, prevailing market rates, the age and condition of customers’ assets including pipelines, gas plants, compression stations, storage facilities, and gathering and distribution systems including the legal and regulatory requirements relating to the inspection and maintenance of those assets. We also bill our customers for per diem charges, mileage, and other reimbursement items. Revenue and costs in this segment may be subject to seasonal variations and interim activity may not be indicative of yearly activity, considering that many of our customers develop yearly operating budgets and enter into contracts with us during the winter season for work to be performed during the remainder of the year. Additionally, inspection work throughout the United States during the winter months (especially in the northern states) may be hampered or delayed due to inclement weather.

 The Pipeline & Process Services segment (formerly our Integrity Services segment) generates revenue primarily by providing essential environmental services including hydrotesting, chemical cleaning, water transfer and recycling, pumping, pigging, flushing, filling, dehydration, caliper runs, ILI tool run support, nitrogen purging, and drying services. We also provide customers with test documentation and records retention services. We generally charge our customers in this segment on a fixed-bid basis, depending on the size and length of the pipeline being tested, the complexity of services provided, and the utilization of our work force and equipment. Our results in this segment are driven primarily by the number of field personnel that perform services for our customers and the fees that we charge for those services, which depend on the type and number of field personnel used on a particular project, the type of equipment used and the fees charged for the utilization of that equipment, and the nature and duration of the project.

 The Environmental Services segment owns and operates nine (9) water treatment facilities with ten (10) EPA Class II injection wells in the Bakken shale region of the Williston Basin in North Dakota. These water treatment facilities are connected to twelve (12) pipeline gathering systems, including two (2) that we developed and own. We specialize in the treatment, recovery, separation, and disposal of waste byproducts generated during the lifecycle of an oil and natural gas well to protect the environment and our drinking water. All of the facilities utilize specialized equipment and remote monitoring to minimize the facilities’ downtime and increase the facilities’ efficiency for peak utilization. We also sell recovered oil, receive fees for pipeline transportation of water, and receive fees from a partially-owned facility for management and staffing services.

Our Relationship with Cypress Energy Holdings, LLC
 
All of the equity interests in our general partner are indirectly owned by Holdings and its affiliates. Holdings is owned by Charles C. Stephenson, Jr.; entities related to Mr. Stephenson’s family; Cynthia A. Field; a company controlled by our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, Peter C. Boylan III; Henry Cornell; and a company controlled by Mr. Cornell.  Holdings’ owners bring substantial industry relationships and specialized, value-creation capabilities that we believe continue to benefit us. Mr. Stephenson has over 50 years of experience as a leader in the oil and natural gas industry. He was the founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vintage Petroleum prior to its sale to Occidental Petroleum in 2006 and is also the retired Chairman of Premier Natural Resources, a private oil and natural gas exploration and production company that he co-founded.  Mr. Boylan has extensive executive management experience with public and private companies and also has extensive public company directorship experience. As the owners of our general partner and the direct or indirect owners of 64% of our outstanding common units and all of our outstanding preferred units, Holdings and its affiliates have a strong alignment of interests with our noncontrolling unitholders.
Business Strategies
 
Our principal business objective is to build a diversified partnership providing essential environmental services that will allow us, over time, to incrementally increase the quarterly cash distributions that we pay to our unitholders. We pursue the following business strategies:

● | Pipeline Inspection. We intend to continue to position ourselves as a trusted provider of high-quality essential inspection services. Over the last few years, new laws have been enacted in the U.S. that, in the future, will require operators to undertake more frequent and more extensive inspections of their pipeline assets. These requirements are not tied to the current state of the oil and gas industry as a whole. Additionally, a significant portion of the pipeline infrastructure in North America was installed decades ago and is therefore more susceptible to degradation requiring more frequent inspections. We believe that increasingly stringent U.S. federal and state laws and regulations and aging pipeline infrastructures will result in increased need for inspection and integrity services and higher demand for independent, third-party inspectors capable of navigating these complicated requirements. Most of our clients are large public companies that have long lead time projects that require our services regardless of the state of the current economy. Our clients also require ongoing maintenance and integrity work on their aging pipelines. Our business is not immune to economic changes in the energy industry; however, we believe that we can continue to grow organically by acquiring new customers and additional work from existing customers. We continue to grow our business development team to pursue these and other opportunities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Pipeline & Process Services. We experienced significant improvements in our utilization rates in this segment in 2019. Improvements were due in part to increasing demand and in part to improved business development efforts. During 2018, we opened a new office in Odessa, Texas, to better serve the growing Permian basin market. In addition, we added several industry veterans to our management team in order to further enhance our image and grow the segment. In early 2019, we opened a new location in the Houston market to help us take advantage of the growing work in the industry. We plan to continue to focus on the potential synergies that may develop between this segment and our other business segments. We continue to enjoy an excellent reputation in the industry and continue to bid on a substantial amount of new work. 


● | Environmental Services. We intend to maintain our position as a high-quality operator of water treatment facilities. We continue to look for pipeline opportunities with exploration and production (“E&P”) companies that will secure water for our water treatment facilities. We remain an approved vendor for many prestigious E&P companies that demand very high standards from their vendors. Although the oil and gas industry can be cyclical in nature, our current business strategy is to derive a significant portion of our volume and revenue from existing wells. We intend to capitalize on the continued demand for removal, treatment, storage and disposal of flowback and produced water by positioning ourselves as a trusted, dependable provider of safe, high-quality water and environmental services to our customers.

● | Optimize existing water treatment assets. The average age of our water treatment facilities was 7.3 years at the end of 2019. We estimate that we utilized approximately 38% of the aggregate annual capacity (35.3 million barrels per year) of these facilities in 2019, evidencing capacity for growth without additional capital expenditures. We are seeking to increase the utilization of our existing water treatment facilities by attracting new volumes from existing customers and by developing new customer relationships, including pipelines. In 2012, only one pipeline was directly connected to our water treatment facilities. We currently have ten pipelines connected to four of our water treatment facilities. Because many of the costs of constructing and operating a water treatment facility are either upfront capital costs or fixed costs, we expect that increased utilization of our existing water treatment facilities would lead to increased operating cash flow in the Environmental Services segment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increase the number of pipelines connected to our water treatment facilities. As more oil and natural gas producers focus on improving operational safety and reducing liability, carbon footprint, road damage, and the total transportation cost associated with the trucking of saltwater, we anticipate that producers may increasingly prefer to utilize pipeline systems to transport their saltwater directly to water treatment facilities. We continue to focus on increasing pipeline water delivered to our facilities. As a percentage of total water volume, pipeline water was 41%, 45% and 46% in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We will continue to focus on potential pipeline opportunities. 
● | Leverage customer relationships in our business segments. We intend to pursue new strategic development opportunities with oil and natural gas producing customers that increase the utilization of our assets and lead to cross-selling opportunities between our business segments. Many customers of the Environmental Services segment also own gathering systems, storage facilities, gas plants, compression stations, and other pipeline assets to which we can offer pipeline inspection and integrity services. In addition, we intend to enhance our relationships with our customers in the Pipeline Inspection segment by broadening the services we provide to our customers, including expanding our ultrasonic nondestructive examination services. By cross-selling our service offerings and adding complementary service offerings, we believe that we can further integrate into our customers’ operations and increase our profitability and distributable cash flow. 
● | Pursue strategic, accretive acquisitions. In 2018, our sponsor, Holdings completed two acquisitions to further broaden our collective suite of environmental services. Importantly, these acquisitions also provided entry into the municipal water industry, whereby we can offer our traditional inspection services, including corrosion and nondestructive testing services, as well as in-line inspection (“ILI”). We remain excited about entering the ILI industry with next generation 5G ultra high-resolution magnetic flux leakage ILI technology called EcoVision UHD, capable of helping pipeline owners and operators better manage the integrity of their assets in both the municipal water and energy industries.

Our Business Segments
 Our business operates in three reportable segments: (1) Pipeline Inspection Services (“Pipeline Inspection”), comprising the TIR Entities’ operations, (2) Pipeline & Process Services, made up of Brown’s operations, and (3) Water and Environmental Services (“Environmental Services”), consisting of water treatment activities. U.S. Treasury Regulations and our IRS private letter ruling (“PLR”) allows for expansion into other lines of business. Our long-term goals continue to be diversifying the Partnership into other attractive lines of business and expanding our customer base within our existing lines of business.
Pipeline Inspection   
Overview. The Pipeline Inspection segment is a leading provider of independent inspection, integrity, and non-destructive examination services to energy and utility industries. We inspect and test infrastructure assets including pipelines, gathering and distribution systems, storage facilities, gas plants, refineries, petrochemical facilities, LNG facilities, compression stations, and pumping stations. Our mission is to provide quality environmental services, in a safe, professional, ethical, and cost-effective manner that can be tailored to add value for our clients throughout the life of their assets. We have also entered into a consolidated joint venture with CF Inspection, a nationally-qualified woman-owned inspection firm. CF Inspection allows us to offer various services to clients that require the services of an approved Women’s Business Enterprise (“WBE”), as CF Inspection is certified as a Women’s Business Enterprise by the Supplier Clearinghouse in California and as a National Women’s Business Enterprise by the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council. We own 49% of CF Inspection and Cynthia A. Field, an affiliate of Holdings and a Director of our General Partner, owns the remaining 51% of CF Inspection. In 2019, CF Inspection, which is part of the Pipeline Inspection segment, represented approximately 3.3% of the Pipeline Inspection segment’s consolidated revenue.
Operations. Oil and natural gas producers, public utility companies, and other pipeline operators are required by federal and state law and regulation to inspect their pipelines and gathering systems on a regular basis in order to protect the environment and ensure public safety. At the beginning of an engagement, our personnel meet with the customer to determine the scope of the project and determine related staffing needs. We then develop a customized, detailed staffing plan, utilizing our proprietary database of professionals. Our inspectors have significant industry experience and are certified to meet the qualification requirements of both the customer and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). As the industry continues to adopt new technology, demand has increased for inspectors with greater technical skills and computer proficiencies. Our customers require inspectors to undergo specific training prior to performing inspection work on their projects. We utilize the National Center for Construction Education and Research and Veriforce training curricula to train and evaluate employees, along with other resources. In addition to assignment-specific training, welding inspectors and coating inspectors also must meet special certification requirements.
 
 The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) recently finalized a rule that significantly revises certain aspects of the hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations codified at Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 190-199. Nearly nine years in the making, the final rule is PHMSA’s response to several significant hazardous liquid pipeline accidents that have occurred in recent years, most notably the 2010 crude oil spill near Marshall, Michigan. The final rule also addresses 2011 and 2016 outstanding congressional mandates and U.S. Government Accountability Office recommendations. Effective July 1, 2020, this rule expands requirements to address risks to pipelines outside of environmentally sensitive and populated areas, requiring the performance of periodic integrity assessments and the use of leak detection systems for all regulated hazardous liquids pipelines (except for offshore gathering and regulated rural gathering lines). In addition, the rule makes changes to the integrity management requirements, including revising data integration requirements and emphasizing the use of in-line inspection technology.  The long-term increasing demand for environmental services such as pipeline inspection, integrity services, and water solutions remains strong due to our nation’s aging pipeline infrastructure, and we believe we continue to be well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. Our General Partner continues to remain fully aligned with our noncontrolling unitholders, as our General Partner and its affiliates collectively own 76% of our total common and preferred units.    In recent years, many companies have been active in constructing new energy infrastructure, such as pipelines, gas plants, compression stations, and storage facilities, which has afforded us the opportunity to provide inspection services on large projects. Currently, many energy companies face challenging market conditions, including lower commodity prices, the COVID-19 pandemic, and negative investor sentiment. Most of our customers are well capitalized; however, a combination of these events could significantly reduce their spending on new projects and maintenance, which could afford us less opportunity to generate revenues and profits. We have taken incremental steps to monitor counterparty risks. 
 In 2019, 2018, and 2017 we employed an average of 1,485, 1,214 and 1,145 inspectors, respectively, in the U.S. and Canada.

Pipeline & Process Services   
Overview.  The Pipeline & Process Services segment provides hydrostatic testing and related services to the pipeline industry, including major natural gas and petroleum companies, as well as pipeline construction companies. We focus on helping our customers meet regulatory pipeline integrity requirements. Our primary emphasis is on hydrostatic testing projects on new and existing pipelines required to maintain compliance with state and federal regulations. We perform all aspects of pipeline hydrostatic testing including filling, pressure testing, and dewatering. Unique test conditions, such as ultra-high pressure tests and pneumatic or nitrogen testing, are performed on a routine basis as well. We provide services on newly-constructed and existing natural gas and crude oil pipelines.
     We maintain a fleet of testing equipment capable of supporting requirements for hydrotesting, chemical cleaning, water transfer and recycling, pumping, pigging, flushing, filling, dehydration, caliper runs, ILI tool run support, nitrogen purging, and drying services. We also provide customers with test documentation and records retention services.
     Operations. Oil and natural gas producers, midstream operators, public utility companies, and other pipeline operators are required by federal and state law to perform routine maintenance on their pipelines and gathering systems on a regular basis. In addition, operators and pipeline construction companies are required to integrity-test newly-constructed pipelines prior to placing the pipelines in service. In our Pipeline & Process Services segment, we contract directly with pipeline owners and with pipeline construction companies to provide testing services. We own and operate our own fill and testing equipment, including specially-designed test trailers. We use a range of fill and pressure equipment to accommodate projects of various sizes. The segment averaged 28, 23 and 20 field technicians performing the testing services in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
     Environmental Services        Overview.  The Environmental Services segment owns and operates nine (9) water treatment facilities with ten (10) EPA Class II injection wells in the Bakken shale region of the Williston Basin in North Dakota. These water treatment facilities are connected to twelve (12) pipeline gathering systems, including two (2) that we developed and own. We specialize in the treatment, recovery, separation, and disposal of waste byproducts generated during the lifecycle of an oil and natural gas well to protect the environment and our drinking water. During 2019, 93% of our volumes were produced water and 41% of our volumes were delivered via  pipeline. Of the volumes from Arnegard, a 25% owned company, 96% of the volumes were produced water and 69% were delivered via pipeline in 2019. We currently serve approximately 86 customers. All of our facilities utilize specialized equipment and remote monitoring to minimize the facilities’ downtime and increase the facilities’ efficiency for peak utilization. We also sell recovered oil, receive fees for pipeline transportation of water, and receive fees from Arnegard for management and staffing services.

Operations. The Environmental Services segment currently generates revenue by providing the following services:
 

● | Flowback water management. We dispose of flowback water produced from hydraulic fracturing operations during the completion of oil and natural gas wells. Fracturing fluids, including a significant amount of water and proppant, are injected into the well during the completion process and are partially recovered as flowback water. E&P companies use water in various formations in order to get higher production yields when the wells are put into production. When it is removed, this flowback water contains sand, salt, chemicals, and residual oil. The oil and natural gas producer typically either transports the flowback water to one of our facilities via pipeline or by truck or contracts with a trucking company for transport. Once the water is received at the water treatment facility, we treat the water through a combination of separation tanks, gun barrels, and chemical processes. The water is then injected into the water treatment well at depths of at least 5,010 feet after recovering the skim oil. We also maintain the ability to store saltwater pending injection. Similar to produced water, we assess the composition of flowback water in our facilities so that we can maximize oil separation and treat the water to maximize the life of our equipment and the wellbore. We believe our approach to scientifically and methodically filtering and treating the flowback water prior to injecting it into our wells helps extend the life of our wells and furthers our reputation as an environmentally-conscious service provider.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Produced water management. We dispose of naturally-occurring water that is extracted during the oil and natural gas production process. This produced water is generated during the entire lifecycle of an oil and natural gas well. While the level of hydrocarbon production declines over the life of a well, the amount of saltwater produced may decline at a slower rate or, in some cases, may even increase. The oil and natural gas producer separates the produced water from the production stream and either transports it to one of our water treatment facilities by truck or pipeline, or contracts with a trucking company to transport it to one of our water treatment facilities. Once we receive the water at one of our water treatment facilities, we filter and treat the water and then inject it into the water treatment well at depths of at least 5,010 feet after recovering any skim oil. We also maintain the ability to store saltwater pending injection. All of our existing facilities were constructed using completion techniques consistent with current industry practices. We periodically sample, test, and assess produced water to determine its chemistry so that we can properly treat the water with the appropriate chemicals that maximize oil separation and the life of our wells. 
● | Byproduct sales. Before we inject flowback and/or produced water into a water treatment well, we separate the residual oil from the saltwater stream. We then store the residual oil in our tanks and sell it to third parties. The residual oil recovery can be significant when substantial drilling and completions occur near our water treatment facilities. 
● | Management of facilities. In addition to the facilities we wholly-own, we manage an additional facility in North Dakota. Our responsibilities in managing this facility typically include operations, billing, collections, insurance, maintenance, repairs, and sales and marketing. We are compensated for the management of this facility based on a percentage of the gross revenue of the facility or a minimum monthly fee. 

 
The majority of the water processed at our water treatment facilities are derived from produced water that is generated throughout the life of the oil or natural gas well. In 2019, 2018, and 2017, produced water represented 93%, 94%, and 93%, respectively, of our total barrels of disposed water. This differentiates us from many competitors that focus on flowback water. As a region matures and the predominant activity shifts from drilling and completion of wells to production, our facilities continue to experience demand for ongoing processing of wastewater produced over the life of the wells. 
 
Each of our facilities is open every day of the year, with some being open by appointment only. Some of our locations include onsite offices and sleeping quarters. We supplement our operations with various automated technologies to improve their efficiency and safety. We have installed 24-hour digital video monitoring and recording systems at each facility. These systems allow us to track operations and unloading activities, as well as to identify customers present at our facilities. We believe that our commitment to operating our facilities with sophisticated technology and automation contributes to our enhanced operating margins and provides our customers with increased safety and regulatory compliance.  Our facilities have been inspected and approved by several of our public E&P customers that have stringent approval standards and field audits performed by their Environmental, Health and Safety groups. We have permitted aggregate maximum daily disposal capacity of 96,800 barrels in the following water treatment facilities, all of which were built using completion techniques consistent with current industry practices and utilizing well depths of 5,350 feet to 6,332 feet with injection intervals beginning at least 5,010 feet beneath the surface. Our permitted capacity is much higher.

Competition
 
Pipeline Inspection   
The pipeline inspection business is highly competitive. Our competition consists primarily of three types of companies: independent energy inspection firms, engineering and construction firms, and diversified inspection service firms. Diversified inspection firms may inspect, for example, electric and nuclear facilities in addition to pipelines and related facilities. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business include gaining and maintaining customer approval to service their pipelines, facilities and gathering systems, the ability to recruit and retain qualified experienced inspectors with multiple skills and nondestructive examination experience, safety record, insurance, the level of inspector training provided, reputation, dependability of services, customer service, and price.
 
  13 
 

Pipeline & Process Services   
The pipeline and process services business is highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our business are customer service, safety, and price. Our competition consists primarily of smaller regional integrity firms and pipeline construction companies that pipeline owners allow to test their own construction and repair work.
Environmental Services   
The Environmental Services business is highly competitive with relatively low barriers of entry. Our competition consists primarily of smaller regional companies that utilize a variety of disposal methods and generally serve specific geographical markets. In addition, we face competition from other large oil field service companies that also own trucking operations and we face competition from our customers, who may have the option of using internal processing methods instead of outsourcing to us or to another third-party company. Many E&P companies also own their own water treatment facilities and water gathering systems, and therefore do not send their produced water to third parties for processing. We believe that the principal competitive differentiating factors in our businesses include gaining and maintaining customer approval of water treatment facilities, location of facilities in relation to customer activity, reputation, safety record, reliability of service, track record of environmental and regulatory compliance, customer service, insurance coverage, and price.
Seasonality
 
Pipeline Inspection   
Inspection work varies depending upon the geographic location of our customers. The second, third, and beginning of the fourth quarters are historically the most active for our pipeline inspection services in the United States as our customers focus on completing projects by year-end. Business has historically been slower in the period from November through March, due to the holiday season, weather, and the budgeting cycles of our customers. We believe our presence across various regions in the U.S. helps mitigate the seasonality of our business. Our public utility operations in California and other locations with moderate climates tend to experience less seasonal volatility.
Pipeline & Process Services   
Since most of the work of the Pipeline & Process Services segment is currently performed in the southern United States, weather does not usually create significant seasonal variations in revenue. Business has historically been slower in the period from November through March, due to the holiday season and the budgeting cycles of our customers.
Environmental Services   
The overall operations and financial performance of our North Dakota operations are affected by seasonality. The volume of water processed in the Bakken Shale region of the Williston Basin in North Dakota tends to be lower in the winter, due to heavy snow and cold temperatures, and in the spring, due to heavy rains and muddy conditions that may lead to road restrictions and weight limits that can impact business. The amount of residual oil is also less prevalent and more difficult to extract during the winter months.
 
Regulation of the Industry
 
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters   
Our operations and the operations of our customers are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety, the discharge of materials, and environmental protection. These laws and regulations may, among other things, require the acquisition of permits for regulated activities; govern the amounts and types of substances that may be released into the environment in connection with our operations; restrict the treatment methods of waste byproducts; limit or prohibit our or our customers’ activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, wilderness areas, or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species; require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our current or former operations; and impose specific standards addressing worker protections. Numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, for which compliance is often costly and difficult. The violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders, assessment of administrative and civil penalties, and even criminal prosecution.

We do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. However, these rules and regulations are constantly evolving, and amendments thereto could result in a material effect on our operations and financial position. Further, while we may occasionally receive citations from environmental regulatory agencies for minor violations, such citations occur in the ordinary course of our business and are generally not material to our operations. However, it is possible that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance may be incurred in the future. It is also possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify. Moreover, changes in environmental laws could limit our customers’ businesses or encourage our customers to handle and dispose of oil and natural gas wastes in other ways, which, in either case, could reduce the demand for our services and adversely impact our business.
 
The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations and the operations of our customers are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or future cash flows.
 
Hazardous substances and wastes. Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid wastes, hazardous wastes, and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes (including substances disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or remediate contaminated property (including groundwater contamination, whether from prior owners or operators or other historical activities or spills). These laws may also require us to conduct natural resource damage assessments and pay penalties for such damages. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for our acts that were in compliance with applicable laws at the time the acts were performed.
 
Petroleum hydrocarbons and other substances arising from oil and natural gas-related activities have been disposed of or released on or under many of our sites. At some of our facilities, we have conducted and continue to conduct monitoring or remediation of known soil and groundwater contamination. We will continue to perform such monitoring and remediation of known contamination, including any post remediation groundwater monitoring that may be required, until the appropriate regulatory standards have been achieved. These monitoring and remediation efforts are usually overseen by state environmental regulatory agencies. 
 
In the future, we may also accept for disposal solids that are subject to the requirements of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of hazardous wastes. Most E&P waste is exempt from stringent regulation as a hazardous waste under RCRA. None of our facilities are currently permitted to accept hazardous wastes for disposal, and we take precautions to help ensure that hazardous wastes do not enter or are not disposed of at our facilities. Some wastes handled by us that currently are exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA or other applicable statutes. For example, in May 2016, a nonprofit environmental group filed suit in the federal district court for the District of Columbia, seeking a declaratory judgment directing the EPA to review and reconsider the RCRA E&P waste exemption. EPA and the environmental group entered into an agreement that was formalized in a consent decree issued by the U.S. District court for the District of Columbia in December 2016. Under the decree, the EPA was required to propose a rulemaking for revisions of certain of its regulations pertaining to E&P wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. After undertaking its review, EPA signed a determination in 2019 concluding that it does not need to regulate E&P wastes, and specifically “drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of oil, gas or geothermal energy,” because the states are adequately regulating E&P wastes under the Subtitle D provisions of RCRA. However, if the RCRA E&P waste exemption is repealed or modified in the future, we could become subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
 
We are required to obtain permits for the disposal of E&P waste as part of our operations. These regulations vary widely from state to state. State permits can restrict pressure, size, and location of disposal operations, impose limits on the types and amount of waste a facility may receive and the overall capacity of a waste disposal facility. States may add additional restrictions on the operations of a disposal facility when a permit is renewed or amended. As these regulations change, our permit requirements could become more stringent and may require material expenditures at our facilities or impose significant restraints or financial assurances on our operations. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and natural gas deposits, and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials, or NORM. NORM wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping, and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements.  It is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of NORM.

Safe Drinking Water Act. Our underground injection operations are subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, as well as analogous state laws and regulations. Under the SDWA, the EPA established the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, program, which established the minimum program requirements for state and local programs regulating underground injection activities. The UIC program includes requirements for permitting, testing, monitoring, record keeping and reporting of injection well activities, as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminant into underground sources of drinking water. State regulations require us to obtain a permit from the applicable regulatory agencies to operate our underground injection wells. Any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells could cause degradation of fresh groundwater resources, potentially resulting in suspension of our UIC permit, issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies, incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource and imposition of liability by third parties for property damages and personal injuries. In addition, storage of residual crude oil collected as part of the saltwater injection process prior to sale could impose liability on us in the event that the entity to which the oil was transferred fails to manage and, as necessary, dispose of residual crude oil in accordance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws.
 
Our customers are subject to these same regulations. While these largely result in their needing our services, some waste regulations could have the opposite effect.  For instance, some states, have considered laws mandating the recycling of flowback and produced water.  If such laws are passed, our customers may divert some saltwater to recycling operations that may have otherwise been disposed of at our facilities. 
 
Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, as amended, establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into regulated waters. The OPA also imposes ongoing requirements on owners or operators of facilities that handle certain quantities of oil, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill. We handle oil at many of our facilities, and if a release of oil into the regulated waters occurred at one of our facilities, we could be liable for cleanup costs and damages under the OPA.
 
Water discharges. The federal Water Pollution Control Act, referred to as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters and impose requirements affecting our ability to conduct activities in regulated waters and wetlands. Pursuant to the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws, permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into regulated waters, and permits or coverage under general permits must also be obtained to authorize discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of industrial facilities, including many of our facilities. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon storage tank spill, rupture, or leak. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
 
We believe that compliance with existing permits and regulatory requirements under the Clean Water Act and state counterparts will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Future changes to permits or regulatory requirements under the Clean Water Act, however, could adversely affect our business.
 
Endangered species. The federal Endangered Species Act, or ESA, restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Many states also have analogous laws designed to protect endangered or threatened species. Additionally, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the Fish and Wildlife Service was required to make a determination on the listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by the end of the Fish and Wildlife Service’s 2017 fiscal year. The Fish and Wildlife Service did not meet that deadline, but continues to consider whether to list additional species under the ESA. Although current listings have not had a material impact on our operations, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species under the ESA or similar state laws could limit our ability to expand our operations and facilities or could force us to incur material additional costs. Moreover, listing such species under the ESA or similar state laws could indirectly, but materially, affect our business by imposing constraints on our customers’ operations, including the curtailment of new drilling or a refusal to allow a new pipeline to be constructed.
 
Air emissions. Some of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants. The Clean Air Act, or CAA, and analogous state laws require permits for and impose other restrictions on facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere above certain specified quantities or in a manner that could adversely affect environmental quality. Failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative, civil, and even criminal penalties. We do not believe that any of our operations are subject to CAA permitting or regulatory requirements for major sources of air emissions, but some of our facilities could be subject to state “minor source” air permitting requirements and other state regulatory requirements for air emissions. Our Pipeline & Process Services segment has certain equipment requirements in various states.

Our customers’ operations may be subject to existing and future CAA permitting and regulatory requirements that could have a material effect on their operations. The EPA recently approved and proposed new CAA rules requiring additional emissions controls and practices for oil and natural gas production wells, including wells that are the subject of hydraulic fracturing operations. The rules also establish new emission requirements for compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing and certain other equipment used in the hydraulic fracturing process. These rules may increase the costs to our customers of developing and producing hydrocarbons, and as a result, may have an indirect and adverse effect on the amount of oilfield waste delivered to our facilities by our customers.
 
Climate change. The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, for example, require certain large stationary sources to obtain Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, pre-construction permits and Title V operating permits for greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities, which was expanded in October 2015 to include onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting activities and natural gas transmission pipelines. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs.  Most of these cap-and-trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and natural gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances that correspond to their annual emissions of GHGs.  In addition, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement entered into force in November 2016 after more than 70 countries, including the United States, ratified or otherwise consent to be bound by the agreement. However, in June 2017, President Trump announced that the United States plans to withdraw from the agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the agreement on different terms or a separately negotiated agreement. In August 2017, the U.S. Department of State officially informed the United Nations of the United States’ intent to withdraw from the agreement, and in November 2019 formally initiated the withdrawal process, which will result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process and/or the terms on which the United States may re-enter the agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. To the extent that the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and natural gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business. The EPA and other federal and state agencies have also acted to address greenhouse gas emissions in other industries, most notably coal-fired power generation, and as a result could attempt in the future to impose additional regulations on the oil and natural gas industry.
 
Although it is not possible at this time to estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business, either directly or indirectly, any future federal or state laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions in areas where we operate could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs. Regulation of GHGs could also result in a reduction in demand for and production of oil and natural gas, which would result in a decrease in demand for our services. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations, but effects could be materially adverse.
 
Hydraulic fracturing. We do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, but we do provide treatment and disposal services with respect to the fluids used and wastes generated by our customers in such operations, which are often necessary to drill and complete new wells and maintain existing wells.  Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand, or other proppants and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.  Presently, hydraulic fracturing is regulated primarily at the state level, typically by state oil and natural gas commissions and similar agencies.  Several states, including North Dakota, where we conduct our Environmental Services business, have either adopted or proposed laws and/or regulations to require oil and natural gas operators to disclose chemical ingredients and water volumes used to hydraulically fracture wells, in addition to more stringent well construction and monitoring requirements.  The chemical ingredient information is generally available to the public via online databases including fracfocus.org, and this may bring more public scrutiny to hydraulic fracturing operations.
 
At the federal level, the SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the UIC program and generally exempts hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection.” The U.S. Congress has in recent legislative sessions considered legislation to amend the SDWA, including legislation that would repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process.
 
Federal agencies have also asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process within their jurisdiction. For example, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, and proposed effluent limitations for the disposal of wastewater from unconventional resources to publicly owned treatment works. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”) published a rule that updated existing regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands, including requirements for disclosure, well bore integrity and handling of flowback water. A U.S. District Court in Wyoming struck down this rule in June 2016; that ruling was overturned and the rule reinstated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in September 2017. However, the DOI formally rescinded the rule in December 2017.

The EPA conducted a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water. The EPA released its final report in December 2016.   The study concluded that under certain limited circumstances, hydraulic fracturing activities and related disposal and fluid management activities, could adversely affect drinking water supplies. This study and other studies that may be undertaken by the EPA or other governmental authorities, depending on their results, could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise.  If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform fracturing.  Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas exploration and production activities by our customers and, therefore, adversely affect our business.  Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and our cost of doing business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed.
 
Occupational Safety and Health Act.  We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety.  OSHA’s hazard communications standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.  These laws and regulations are subject to frequent changes.  Failure to comply with these laws could lead to the assertion of third-party claims against us, civil and/or criminal fines, and changes in the way we operate our facilities that could have an adverse effect on our financial position.
 
Seismic activity.  Several states have acted to address a growing concern that the underground injection of water into disposal wells may have triggered seismic activity in certain areas. Any new seismic permitting requirements applicable to disposal wells would impose more stringent permitting requirements and would be likely to result in added costs to comply or, perhaps, may require alternative methods of disposing of saltwater and other fluids, which could delay production schedules and also result in increased costs. Additional regulatory measures designed to minimize or avoid damage to geologic formations may be imposed to address such concerns.
 
Employees
 
The Partnership does not have any employees. All of the employees that conduct our business are employed by affiliates of our general partner, although we sometimes refer to these individuals in this report as our employees.
 
We are managed and operated by the directors and officers of our general partner. As of December 31, 2019, we employed 143 people in our corporate office, who provide various services including management, human resources, information technology, safety, and accounting, among others.
 
Our Pipeline Inspection segment employs a number of inspectors that varies based on client needs (we generally only employ these inspectors when there is a specific client project to deploy them on). As of December 31, 2019, this segment employed 1,297 inspectors, all of whom were employed in the United States.
 
Our Pipeline & Process Services segment employed 41 people at December 31, 2019. Most of the employees in the Pipeline & Process Services segment are full-time employees who are compensated regardless of whether or not they are deployed on a client project.
 
Our Environmental Services segment employed 11 people at December 31, 2019, all of whom work at our North Dakota facilities.
 
Certain inspectors of our Pipeline Inspection segment are members of a union and are covered by collective bargaining arrangements. As of December 31, 2019, 111 inspectors were members of a union. None of our other employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements.
 
Insurance Matters
 
Our customers require that we maintain certain minimum levels of insurance and evaluate our insurance coverage as part of the initial and ongoing approval process they require to use our services. We also carry a variety of insurance coverages for our operations as required by law. However, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or may not cover all losses, and losses not covered by insurance would increase our costs. Also, insurance rates have been subject to wide fluctuation, and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost, or higher deductibles and retentions.
 
Our businesses can be dangerous, involving unforeseen circumstances such as environmental damage from leaks, spills, or vehicle accidents. To address the hazards inherent in Environmental Services, our insurance coverage includes business, auto liability, commercial general liability, employer’s liability, environmental and pollution, and other coverage. To address the hazards inherent in Pipeline Inspection and Pipeline & Process Services, insurance coverage includes employer’s liability, auto liability, employee benefits liabilities, and contractor’s pollution and other coverage. We also carry cybersecurity and crime coverage that benefits all of our business segments. Coverage for environmental and pollution-related losses is subject to significant limitations. We do not carry business interruption insurance, given its cost and its coverage limitations.
