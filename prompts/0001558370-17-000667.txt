 Item 1.  Business.
 (a)General Development of Business
 Spin-Off of TripCo from Liberty Interactive Corporation
 During October 2013, the Board of Directors of Liberty Interactive Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Liberty”) authorized a plan to distribute to the stockholders of Liberty’s Liberty Ventures common stock shares of a newly-formed company, Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (“TripCo” or the “Company”) (the “TripCo Spin-Off”). TripCo holds the subsidiaries TripAdvisor, Inc. (“TripAdvisor”) and BuySeasons, Inc., which includes the retail businesses of BuyCostumes.com and Celebrate Express (“BuySeasons”), both of which operate as stand-alone operating entities. Both TripAdvisor and BuySeasons have more revenue in the third quarter, based on a higher travel research period and the Halloween period, respectively, as compared to the other quarters of the year. The TripCo Spin-Off was completed on August 27, 2014 and effected as a pro-rata dividend of shares of TripCo to the stockholders of Series A and Series B Liberty Ventures common stock of Liberty. 
 Following the TripCo Spin-Off, Liberty and TripCo operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. In connection with the TripCo Spin-Off, TripCo entered into certain agreements, including the reorganization agreement, the services agreement, the facilities sharing agreement and the tax sharing agreement, with Liberty and/or Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty Media”) (or certain of their subsidiaries) in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between the companies after the TripCo Spin-Off and to provide for an orderly transition.
 The reorganization agreement provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions (including the internal restructuring) required to effect the TripCo Spin-Off, certain conditions to the TripCo Spin-Off and provisions governing the relationship between TripCo and Liberty with respect to and resulting from the TripCo Spin-Off.
 Pursuant to the services agreement, Liberty Media provides TripCo with general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury and investor relations support. TripCo reimburses Liberty Media for direct, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Liberty Media in providing these services and TripCo pays a services fee to Liberty Media under the services agreement that is subject to adjustment semi-annually, as necessary. 
 Under the facilities sharing agreement, TripCo shares office space with Liberty Media and related amenities at Liberty Media’s corporate headquarters in Englewood, Colorado. 
 The tax sharing agreement provides for the allocation and indemnification of tax liabilities and benefits between Liberty and TripCo and other agreements related to tax matters. Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, TripCo has agreed to indemnify Liberty, subject to certain limited exceptions, for losses and taxes resulting from the TripCo Spin-Off to the extent such losses or taxes result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain restrictive covenants made by TripCo (applicable to actions or failures to act by TripCo and its subsidiaries following the completion of the TripCo Spin-Off).

Financial information related to our operating segments can be found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements found in Part II of this report.
 (c)Narrative Description of Business
 TripAdvisor 
 TripAdvisor, by and through its subsidiaries, owns and operates a portfolio of online travel brands. TripAdvisor is the world’s largest travel site and its mission is to help people around the world plan, book and experience the perfect trip. TripAdvisor accomplishes this by, among other things, aggregating millions of travelers’ reviews and opinions about destinations, accommodations, activities and attractions, and restaurants worldwide, thereby creating the foundation for a unique platform that enables users to research and plan their travel experiences. TripAdvisor’s platform also enables users to compare real-time pricing and availability for these experiences as well as to book hotels, flights, cruises, vacation rentals, tours, activities and attractions, and restaurants, on either a TripAdvisor site or app, or a travel partner site or app. 
 TripAdvisor-branded websites include tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the website in 48 markets and 28 languages worldwide. TripAdvisor-branded websites reached nearly 390 million average monthly unique visitors in its seasonal peak during the year ended December 31, 2016, according to its internal log files. TripAdvisor’s websites feature approximately 465 million reviews and opinions on 7 million places to stay, places to eat and things to do – including 1,060,000 hotels and accommodations and 835,000 vacation rentals, 4.3 million restaurants and 760,000 activities and attractions worldwide. In addition to the flagship TripAdvisor brand, TripAdvisor manages and operates 23 other travel media brands, connected by the common goal of providing users the most comprehensive travel-planning and trip-taking resources in the travel industry. In order to achieve its goals, TripAdvisor leverages its key assets: a loyal travel community, rich user-generated content, end-to-end travel experience, continuous technological innovation and global reach.

 TripAdvisor’s systems infrastructure, web and database servers for TripAdvisor branded websites are housed at two geographically separate facilities and have multiple communication links as well as continuous monitoring and engineering support. Each facility is fully self-sufficient and operational with its own hardware, networking, software, and content, and is structured in an active/passive, fully redundant configuration. Substantially all of its software components, data, and content are replicated in multiple datacenters and development centers, as well as being backed up at offsite locations. TripAdvisor’s systems are monitored and protected though multiple layers of security. Several of its individual subsidiaries and businesses, including Viator, have their own data infrastructure and technology teams.
 Business Model
 TripAdvisor’s platforms connect users wishing to plan and book the best travel experiences with providers of travel accommodations and travel services worldwide. TripAdvisor manages its business in two reportable segments: Hotel and Non-Hotel. TripAdvisor derives the majority of its revenue from its Hotel segment. TripAdvisor’s Hotel segment accounted for 80%, 85%, and 91%, of its consolidated revenue in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and includes the following revenue sources:
· | Click-Based Advertising and Transaction Revenue. TripAdvisor’s largest source of Hotel segment revenue is generated from click-based advertising on TripAdvisor-branded websites, which is primarily comprised of contextually-relevant booking links to its partners’ sites. TripAdvisor’s click-based advertising partners are predominantly online travel agencies (“OTAs”), and direct suppliers in the hotel product category. Click-based advertising is generally priced on a cost-per-click (“CPC”), basis, with payments from advertisers determined by the number of users who click on a link multiplied by the price that partner is willing to pay for that click, or hotel shopper lead. CPC rates are determined in a dynamic, competitive auction process that enables TripAdvisor’s partners to use its proprietary, automated bidding system to submit CPC bids to have their hotel rates and availability listed on TripAdvisor’s site. Transaction revenue is generated from its instant booking feature, which enables the merchant of record, generally an OTA or hotel partner, to pay a commission to TripAdvisor for a user that completes a hotel reservation on its website. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Display-Based and Subscription-Based Advertising Revenue. Advertising partners can promote their brands in a contextually-relevant manner through a variety of display-based advertising placements on TripAdvisor’s websites. TripAdvisor’s display-based advertising clients are predominately direct suppliers of hotels, airlines and cruises, as well as destination marketing organizations. TripAdvisor also accept display advertising from OTAs, and attractions, as well as advertisers from non-travel categories. Display-based advertising is sold predominantly on a cost per thousand impressions (“CPM”), basis. Subscription-based advertising is offered to hotels, B&Bs and other specialty lodging properties. This advertising product is sold for a flat fee and enables subscribers to list, for a contracted period of time, a website URL, email address and phone number on TripAdvisor-branded websites, as well as to post special offers for travelers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other Hotel Revenue. TripAdvisor’s other hotel revenue primarily includes revenue from non-TripAdvisor branded websites, such as smartertravel.com, independenttraveler.com, and bookingbuddy.com, which includes click-based advertising revenue, display-based advertising revenue, hotel room reservations sold through these websites, and advertising revenue from making cruise reservations available for price comparison and booking. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A significant percentage of TripAdvisor’s users are not hotel shoppers and visit TripAdvisor sites without navigating to pages that contain a listing of hotels in a particular city or a specific hotel’s page.  These users contribute to TripAdvisor’s Non-Hotel segment revenue, which accounted for 20%, 15% and 9% of TripAdvisor’s consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and consists of the following businesses:

· | Attractions. TripAdvisor provides information and services for users to research and book activities, attractions in popular travel destinations through TripAdvisor’s dedicated attractions business, Viator. TripAdvisor generates revenue by charging the operators a commission for each transaction it facilitates through its online reservation systems. In addition to its consumer-direct business, Viator also powers activity and attractions booking capabilities to its affiliate partners, including some of the world’s top airlines, hotel 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

chains and online and offline travel agencies. Viator’s bookable inventory is available on www.viator.com as well as on TripAdvisor-branded websites and mobile applications.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Restaurants. Through its restaurant reservations business, The Fork, TripAdvisor provides information and services for users to research and book restaurants. The Fork is an online restaurant booking platform operating on a number of sites (including www.lafourchette.com, www.eltenedor.com, www.iens.nl, www.besttables.com, www.dimmi.com.au, and www.en.couverts.nl), with a network of restaurant partners primarily across Europe and Australia. The Fork generates revenue by charging TripAdvisor’s restaurant partners a fee for each restaurant guest, or per seated diner, that it facilitates through TripAdvisor’s online reservation systems. The Fork also provides flexible online booking and a premium data and analytics tool, for which the restaurant owner pays a subscription fee. The Fork’s bookable inventory is also available on TripAdvisor-branded websites and mobile applications.

· | Vacation Rentals. TripAdvisor provides information and services for users to research and book vacation and short-term rental properties, including full home rentals, condominiums, villas, beach rentals, cabins and cottages. The vacation rentals business generates revenue by offering individual property owners and property managers, the ability to list their properties on TripAdvisor’s websites and mobile applications through a free-to-list, commission-based option, and to a lesser extent, an annual subscription-based fee structure. These properties are listed on a number of platforms, including www.flipkey.com, www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.housetrip.com, www.niumba.com, and www.vacationhomerentals.com, as well as on TripAdvisor-branded websites.

  TripAdvisor’s Industry 
 TripAdvisor operates in the global travel industry, focusing exclusively on online travel activity and the online advertising market.
 According to Phocuswright, global travel spending is expected to be greater than $1.3 trillion in 2017, or an increase of 5% over 2016. Recent trends show that, each year, an increasing percentage of global travel spending is conducted online through supplier websites and OTAs. TripAdvisor believes that this trend will continue as online penetration continues to grow, as more consumers around the world gain broadband access to the Internet, as smartphone, tablets and other mobile computing devices continue to proliferate, and as travel activity increases along with an expanding middle class in certain countries like China and India. 
 TripAdvisor believes that the Internet will continue to become even more integral to the travel-planning process due to increasing worldwide online penetration, particularly given the capabilities that the Internet provides travelers, including the ability to refine searches, compare destinations, read and contribute user-generated content, view real-time pricing and determine availability, complete bookings, and access information while in-destination. 
 Travel-related advertisers continue to allocate greater percentages of their marketing budgets to online channels, mirroring the trend in consumer media consumption generally. Given the size and growth of the global travel market, as well as a growing percentage of travel transactions taking place online, TripAdvisor believes that travel-related businesses will continue to devote significant marketing dollars to online platforms in order to advertise their travel products and services.
 Commercial Relationships
 TripAdvisor has a number of commercial relationships that are important to the success of its business.  Although these relationships are memorialized in agreements, many of these agreements are for limited terms or are terminable at will or on short notice.  
 TripAdvisor has commercial relationships with the majority of the world’s leading OTAs as well as a variety of other travel suppliers pursuant to which these companies purchase traveler leads from TripAdvisor, generally on a click-based advertising basis. For the year ended December 31, 2016, TripAdvisor’s two most significant click-based and transaction advertising partners were Expedia Inc. (“Expedia”) and The Priceline Group Inc. (“Priceline”), including 

 
  I-5

 
certain of their respective brands. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Expedia and Priceline, each accounted for more than 10% of TripAdvisor’s consolidated revenue and together accounted for 46%, 46% and 46%, respectively, of its consolidated revenue. Nearly all of this concentration of revenue is recorded in TripAdvisor’s Hotel segment for these reporting periods. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, Expedia accounted for 12% and 11%, respectively, of TripAdvisor’s total accounts receivable.
  TripAdvisor’s instant booking feature enables hotel shoppers to book directly with a third-party partner, without leaving TripAdvisor’s website.  To facilitate this user experience, TripAdvisor has entered into contracts with the majority of the world’s top hotel chains, including Accor, Best Western International, Carlson Rezidor, Choice Hotels, Hyatt Hotels, Marriott International, Hilton and Wyndham Worldwide. TripAdvisor also partnered with Priceline and Expedia, whereby certain of their online travel brands participate in TripAdvisor’s instant booking feature.  As a result, users are able to book more than 560,000 hotels worldwide, powered by its partners, without leaving the TripAdvisor site or mobile experience. 
 Intellectual Property
 TripAdvisor’s intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology and trade secrets, is an important component of its business. TripAdvisor relies on its intellectual property rights in its content, proprietary technology, software code, ratings indexes, databases of reviews and forum content, images, videos, graphics and brands. TripAdvisor has acquired some of its intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties. These licenses and agreements may place restrictions on its use of the intellectual property.
 TripAdvisor protects its intellectual property by relying on its terms of use, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, as well as on international, national, state and common law rights. In addition, TripAdvisor enters into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. TripAdvisor protects its brands by pursuing the trademark registration of its core brands, as appropriate, maintaining its trademark portfolio, securing contractual trademark rights protection when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. TripAdvisor also registers copyrights and domain names as deemed appropriate. Additionally, TripAdvisor protects its trademarks, domain names and copyrights with the use of intellectual property licenses and an enforcement program.
 TripAdvisor has considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions, as circumstances may warrant.  However, many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by TripAdvisor.
 Seasonality
 Traveler expenditures in the global travel market tend to follow a seasonal pattern. As such, expenditures by travel advertisers to market to potential travelers and, therefore, TripAdvisor’s financial performance, tends to be seasonal as well. As a result, the third quarter tends to be TripAdvisor’s seasonal high, as it is a key period for travel research and trip-taking and its seasonal low generally occurs in the first and/or fourth quarter. Significant shifts in TripAdvisor’s business mix or adverse economic conditions could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends.
 Terms of Investment in TripAdvisor
 We own an approximate 21% equity interest and 56% voting interest in TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the holders of TripAdvisor common stock, acting as a single class, are entitled to elect a number of directors equal to 25% of the total number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, which is currently three directors. As discussed previously we currently consolidate TripAdvisor as we control a majority of the voting interest in TripAdvisor. We are subject to a Governance Agreement with TripAdvisor which provides us with certain director nomination, registration and other rights and imposes certain restrictions on our shares of Class B common stock.

 BuySeasons 
 BuySeasons is a wholly owned subsidiary of TripCo that owns and operates BuyCostumes.com and the Celebrate Express family of websites. Liberty acquired BuySeasons in 2006, which in turn acquired Celebrate Express in 2008. BuySeasons, an internet celebrations leader, provides a unique party offering by giving individuals the resources necessary to plan, execute and attend a wide variety of celebrations and costuming events. These resources include party supplies primarily through retail partner and marketplace websites which offer proprietary products through exclusive license agreements and costumes for a wide variety of occasions (the primary occasion is Halloween). BuySeasons purchases its products from various suppliers, both domestic and international. BuySeasons depends on three suppliers for approximately one half of its costumes, accessories, and party supplies. The loss of any of these suppliers could adversely impact stand alone financial results of BuySeasons.
 BuySeasons’ business is highly seasonal with approximately half of its revenue earned from the sale of costumes in September and October leading up to Halloween. Since the acquisition of Celebrate Express, BuySeasons has seen the seasonality decrease slightly due to higher sales of birthday party supplies which is a less seasonal business. BuySeasons outsources 100% of its customer service function, with the management of such function being maintained at its corporate headquarters. Customer service representatives are available up to nine hours a day, and up to seven days a week during its busy season to respond to customer questions. The customer service center and warehouse staffing is scalable and BuySeasons employs seasonal labor to react to higher volume during the peak Halloween season. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 Internet Services
 Our online commerce businesses are subject, both directly and indirectly, to various domestic and foreign laws and governmental regulations. Certain of these businesses engaged in the provision of goods and services over the Internet must comply with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to online communications and commerce. For example, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) prohibits web sites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without parental consent and imposes a number of operational requirements. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has adopted regulations implementing COPPA. Certain email activities are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, commonly known as the CAN-SPAM Act. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial email by requiring the email sender, among other things, to comply with specific disclosure requirements and to provide an “opt-out” mechanism for recipients. Both of these laws include statutory penalties for non-compliance. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits, but does not eliminate, liability for listing or linking to third party websites that may include content that infringes on copyrights or other rights so long as our Internet businesses comply with the statutory requirements. Various states also have adopted laws regulating certain aspects of Internet communications. In 2016, Congress enacted a permanent moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access and commerce.
 Our online commerce businesses also are subject to laws governing the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally-identifiable information about their users. In particular, the collection and use of personal information by companies has received increased regulatory scrutiny on a global basis. The enactment, interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country. For example, in April 2016, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the General Data Regulation which established new data laws that give customers additional rights and impose additional restrictions and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information. The new data laws take effect in May 2018. Further, on October 6, 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the “Safe Harbor Framework,” which had allowed companies to collect and process personal data in European Union nations for use in the U.S. In early 2016, European and U.S. authorities reached agreement on a new data transfer framework, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which became fully operational on August 1, 2016. Finally, on January 10, 2017, the European Commission proposed new regulations regarding privacy and electronic communications, including additional regulation of the Internet tracking tools known as “cookies.”

 
  I-7

 

 In the U.S., the FTC has proposed a privacy policy framework, and the new Congress may consider legislation that would require organizations that suffer a breach of security related to personal information to notify owners of such information. Many states have adopted laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach affecting personal data, such as California’s Information Practices Act. Complying with these different national and state privacy requirements may cause the Internet companies in which we have interests to incur substantial costs. In addition, such companies generally have and post on their websites privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. A failure to comply with such posted privacy policies or with the regulatory requirements of federal, state, or foreign privacy laws could result in proceedings or actions by governmental agencies or others (such as class action litigation) which could adversely affect our online commerce businesses. Technical violations of certain privacy laws can result in significant penalties, including statutory penalties. In 2012, the FCC amended its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), which could subject our Internet businesses to increased liability for certain telephonic communications with customers, including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble such damage awards for willful or knowing violations. Data collection, privacy and security are growing public concerns. If consumers were to decrease their use of our Internet businesses’ websites to purchase products and services, such businesses could be harmed. Congress, individual states and foreign authorities may consider additional online privacy legislation.
 Goods sold over the Internet also must comply with traditional regulatory requirements, such as the FTC requirements regarding truthful and accurate claims. Other Internet-related laws and regulations enacted in the future may cover issues such as defamatory speech, copyright infringement, pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services. The future adoption of such laws or regulations may slow the growth of commercial online services and the Internet, which could in turn cause a decline in the demand for the services and products of our online commerce businesses and increase their costs of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on their businesses, operating results and financial conditions. Moreover, the applicability to commercial online services and the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, personal privacy and taxation is uncertain and could expose these companies to substantial liability.
 In 2015, the FCC adopted open Internet rules that reclassify wireline and wireless broadband services as Title II common carrier services and regulate broadband services offered by Internet service providers (“ISPs”) under Title II, Title III and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  The regulations prohibit ISPs from: (1) blocking access to, or impairing or degrading, legal content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (2) favoring selected Internet traffic in exchange for consideration.  The rules also allow the FCC to hear complaints and take enforcement action if it determines that the interconnection agreements of ISPs are not just and reasonable, or if ISPs fail to meet a new general obligation not to unreasonably interfere with or unreasonably disadvantage consumers or edge providers. The open Internet rules were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in June 2016, but remain subject to additional appeals.  Congress or the FCC may modify or repeal the existing regulations.
 Proposed Changes in Regulation
 The regulation of Internet services, online sales and other forms of product marketing is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past decade. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated and there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation. Competition
 TripAdvisor
 TripAdvisor competes in rapidly evolving and competitive markets. TripAdvisor faces competition for content, users, advertisers, online travel search and price comparison services or what is known in the industry as hotel metasearch, and online reservations. In the competition to attract users to its platform, TripAdvisor relies on its ability to acquire traffic through offline brand recognition and brand-direct efforts such as online search, email and television.  These marketing strategies can be impacted by competitive site content, changes to TripAdvisor’s website architecture and page designs, 

 
  I-8

 
changes to search engine ranking algorithms, updates in competitor advertising strategies, or changes to display ordering in search engine results such as preferred placement for internal products offered by search engines.
 TripAdvisor competes with different types of companies in the various markets and geographies it participates in, including large and small companies in the travel space as well as broader service providers. More specifically:

· | In TripAdvisor’s Hotel segment, it faces competition from OTAs (including Expedia, Priceline and certain of their respective subsidiaries), hotel metasearch providers (including trivago, Kayak, Ctrip.com International, Ltd. and HotelsCombined), large online search, social media, and marketplace companies (including Google, Microsoft Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Facebook, Alibaba and Amazon), traditional offline travel agencies, and global hotel chains seeking to promote direct bookings.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | TripAdvisor also faces competition in its Non-Hotel segment. TripAdvisor’s Attractions business competes with traditional travel agencies, online providers, wholesalers, and individual tour operators. TripAdvisor’s Restaurants business competes with other online restaurant reservation services, such as Yelp, OpenTable (a subsidiary of Priceline) and local or regional providers. TripAdvisor’s Vacation Rentals business competes with companies focused on alternative lodging and shared accommodations, including Airbnb and HomeAway (a subsidiary of Expedia).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As the industry shifts towards online travel services and the technology supporting it continues to evolve, including platforms such as smartphone and tablet computing devices, TripAdvisor anticipates that the existing competitive landscape will continue to change, new competitors may emerge, and industry consolidation may continue. 
 BuySeasons
 The party and costume segments have a large number of independent retailers. BuySeasons competes with traditional brick-and-mortar and online retailers ranging from large department stores to specialty shops, electronic retailers, direct marketing retailers, such as mail order and catalog companies, and discount retailers. BuySeasons has faced increased competition from both internet companies and brick-and-mortar stores resulting in declining revenue and lower margins due primarily to increased marketing spend and discounting of products to drive sales. In order to try and reverse these adverse trends, BuySeasons has significantly reduced the focus on its retail websites and instead is focused on its relationships with online marketplaces, such as Amazon, and dropship partners.
 Due to the nature of the party and costume businesses, there is not a single or small group of competitors that own a significant portion of the overall market share. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets in which BuySeasons competes are selection, price, availability of inventory, convenience, brand recognition, accessibility, customer service, reliability, website performance, and ease of use.
