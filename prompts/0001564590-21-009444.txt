Overview
 On December 18, 2019, Xperi Corporation (“Xperi”) entered into a definitive agreement with TiVo Corporation (“TiVo”), to combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction (the “Mergers”). Following consummation of the Mergers on June 1, 2020, Xperi Holding Corporation became the parent company of both Xperi and TiVo. The common stock of both Xperi and TiVo were de-registered after completion of the Mergers. On June 2, 2020, Xperi Holding Corporation’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, commenced trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “XPER.” Xperi was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Mergers. As a result, the historical financial statements of Xperi for periods prior to the Mergers are considered to be the historical financial statements of Xperi Holding Corporation. As used herein, the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Xperi when referring to periods prior to June 1, 2020 and Xperi Holding Corporation when referring to periods subsequent to June 1, 2020. Our results of operations include the operations of TiVo after June 1, 2020. Unless specified otherwise, the financial results in this Annual Report are those of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. For further discussion on the Mergers, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and “Note 9 – Business Combination” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 We are a leading consumer and entertainment product/solutions licensing company and one of the industry’s largest intellectual property licensing platforms, with a diverse portfolio of media and semiconductor intellectual property and more than 11,000 patents and patent applications worldwide. We invent, develop, and deliver technologies that enable extraordinary experiences. Xperi technologies, delivered via our brands (DTS, HD Radio, IMAX Enhanced, Invensas, TiVo), and by our subsidiary, Perceive Corporation (“Perceive”), make entertainment more entertaining, and smart devices smarter. Our technologies are integrated into billions of consumer devices, media platforms, and semiconductors worldwide, driving increased value for partners, customers and consumers. We shape how millions of consumers access and experience entertainment content, and our innovations are found in billions of devices and hundreds of millions of interfaces around the globe. Headquartered in Silicon Valley with operations around the world, we have approximately 1,850 employees and over 30 years of operating experience.
 Following the Mergers, we determined that we conduct our business in two operating segments: (1) Product and (2) Intellectual Property (“IP”) Licensing. The Product segment consists primarily of licensing our internally-developed audio, digital radio, imaging, edge-based machine learning and multi-channel video user experience (“UX”) solutions. Audio, digital radio, imaging solutions and edge-based machine learning include the delivery of software and/or hardware-based solutions to our consumer electronics (“CE”) customers, automotive manufacturers or their supply chain partners. UX products and services revenue is primarily derived from multi-channel video service providers and CE manufacturers, licensing the TiVo service and selling TiVo-enabled devices like the Stream 4K, Personalized Content Discovery, enriched Metadata, viewership data and advertising.
 The IP Licensing segment consists primarily of licensing our innovations to leading companies in the media and semiconductor industries. Licensing arrangements include access to one or more of our foundational patent portfolios and may also include access to some of our industry-leading technologies and proven know-how. In media, our licensees include multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), over-the-top (“OTT”) video service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers, social media and other new media companies. In semiconductor, our licensees include memory, sensors, RF component, and foundry companies.
 We are currently contemplating and may pursue, subject to any required regulatory approvals, a separation of our product business and IP Licensing business through a tax-efficient transaction, resulting in two independent, publicly traded companies. We are evaluating the optimal timing of the contemplated business separation and currently anticipate that such separation will not be completed earlier than the first half of 2022.

Competition
 Consumer Experience
 The TiVo Stream competes against products with on-demand OTT streaming capabilities offered by internet CE manufacturers. For example, many CE manufacturers have television or internet-enabled streaming devices for accessing video over the internet such as Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Google Chromecast, and Roku. 
 Metadata. In metadata, we compete with other providers of entertainment-related content metadata such as Gracenote (a subsidiary of Nielsen Holdings plc) and Ericsson Group's Red Bee Media, as well as a number of local metadata providers. While we do not believe that our competitors' metadata sets offer the same comprehensive breadth of focus on media exploration, discovery, and management in as many regions of the world as we do, they present competition to our metadata business for each of their areas of focus. 
 TV Audience Data. We collect and analyze audience research data in an area where companies such as comScore, Inc. and Nielsen Holdings plc and other online data analytics companies compete for research spend from advertisers, advertising agencies and television networks. Other large companies are also focusing resources in this area including Comcast, Facebook, Inc. and Alphabet, Inc.’s Google business. Many of our existing customers are investing in significant platforms to enable their businesses with these capabilities. We believe that there is a significant opportunity for us as an independent data and technology provider, with proprietary access to critical data assets associated with consumers’ engagement with entertainment media. 
 Audio and Imaging. Our audio and imaging licensing products face competition from other third-party providers of similar solutions as well as internal engineering and design groups among industry IC provider and consumer electronics manufacturers. 
 11


In the audio market, our primary competitor is Dolby Laboratories, which develops and markets, among other things, high‑definition audio products and services. Dolby’s long‑standing market position, brand, business relationships, resources and inclusion in various industry standards provide it with a strong competitive position.
 In addition to Dolby, we compete in specific product markets with companies such as Fraunhofer IIS and various other consumer electronics product manufacturers. Many of these competitors have a wide variety of strengths that afford them competitive advantages, such as longer operating histories, greater resources, greater name recognition, or the ability to offer their technologies for a lower price or for free.  We have historically competed effectively against these competitors due in part to our ability to position our brand as a premium offering that contains superior proprietary technology, the quality of our customer service, our inclusion in industry standards and our industry relationships.
 Our image processing technologies broadly compete with other image processing software vendors such as ArcSoft, Inc., as well as engineering and design groups of mobile phone and digital camera manufacturers that seek to provide similar technologies by employing different approaches.
 Connected Car
 Our HD Radio and DTS AutoStage solutions face competition from subscription-based digital service providers such as Sirius/XM, Pandora, Gracenote, and other digital audio and data service providers.
 Our in-cabin monitoring technologies broadly compete with other image processing software vendors targeting the automotive industry such as SmartEye and Seeing Machines, as well as engineering and design groups of tier one automotive suppliers that seek to provide similar technologies by employing different approaches with their internal teams. 
 Pay-TV
 There are a number of companies that produce and market advanced media solutions such as UXs, IPGs, DVRs, search, recommendation, natural language voice, metadata, and advanced data and analytics in the various formats which compete, or we believe will compete, with our products and services over time. Principal competitive factors include brand recognition and awareness, product and service functionality, innovation, ease of use, personalization, content access and availability, mobility and pricing. While we are competitive across this range of factors, we believe our primary competitive differentiation includes our ability to integrate all of our products to create unique value to our customers and the depth and breadth of our IP portfolio. 
 Our Platform Solutions face competition from companies such as Synamedia, MediaKind, Kudelski, SA, MobiTV, Inc., Enghouse Systems Limited, and from multiple system operators (“MSOs”) developed solutions such as Comcast X1 and Liberty Global plc's Horizon Media, which have created competing products that provide user interface software for use on STBs and CE and mobile devices. Such companies may offer more economically attractive agreements to service providers and CE manufacturers by bundling multiple products together. Another common competitor we encounter for our Pay-TV product offerings is a customer who chooses to build its own IPG and DVR solution. While we believe that we provide a strong alternative to “do-it-yourself,” as we have innovative, high-quality products ready to be implemented, with local and network DVR, integrated data distribution infrastructure and content, as well as third party services (such as VOD services), certain customers have moved to their own internal solutions. We differentiate our products by continuing to integrate our broad portfolio of products into a suite of solutions and services for our customers. We believe our solutions can speed our customers' time to market, can be deployed at a lower cost than internally-built products, and can be superior to “do-it-yourself” products. 
 Over time, we expect to see new competitors and other competing technologies emerge.
 IP Licensing Segment
 The IP Licensing segment consists primarily of licensing our innovations to leading companies in the media and semiconductor industries. Licensing arrangements include access to one or more of our foundational patent portfolios and may also include access to some of our industry-leading technologies and proven know-how.
Strategy

Competition
 Due to the exclusionary nature of patent rights, we do not compete, in a traditional sense, with other patent holders for patent licensing relationships. Other patent holders do not have the same rights to the inventions and technologies encompassed by our patent portfolio. In any service, device or piece of equipment that contains intellectual property, the provider or manufacturer may need to obtain licenses from multiple holders of intellectual property. In licensing our patent portfolio, we compete with other patent holders for a share of the royalties that certain licensees may argue to be the total royalty that is supported by a certain service(s) or product(s), which may face practical limitations. 
 15


We compete primarily with internal technology development groups within our respective technology licensing markets, who may create their own solutions that compete with technologies that we license. In general, there may be several ways to solve a particular technical problem and there can be no assurance that our inventions and approaches will be the ones generally adopted by the industry. We also compete with other companies in acquiring patent portfolios.
 Protecting Our Investment
 Although we are engaged with and have successfully licensed and transferred our technologies to many companies, some of the companies that use our patented technologies have nonetheless chosen not to enter into license agreements with us. Consequently, we have, at times, initiated litigation to enforce our IP rights and protect our investment. We view litigation as an instrument of last resort, and we use it only when our efforts to reach negotiated licenses have stalled or failed. If we are unable to secure license agreements on favorable terms through negotiations, or if licensees do not comply with the terms of their licenses, we might have to file new litigation to enforce our rights. See Part 1, Item 3-Legal Proceedings.
 Intellectual Property Portfolio
 We operate in an industry in which innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are critical for success. We protect our innovations and inventions through a variety of means, including but not limited to applying for patent protection domestically and internationally.
 As of December 31, 2020, we held approximately 4,615 United States issued patents and 1,235 patent applications, as well as approximately 4,000 foreign issued patents and 1,650 patent applications. The last of the issued patents to expire is in 2039.
 From time to time, we acquire complementary IP portfolios. Our criteria for patent acquisitions include: compatibility with our existing portfolios, the number and jurisdiction of patent assets, the technical and legal strength of the patents, the actual or likely adoption by industry, and the economic value of the inventions. See Part I, Item 1A- Risk Factors.
 Research & Development
 As demonstrated by our portfolio of industry recognized, widely-deployed advanced technologies and intellectual property (IP), we have a long track record of innovating in the fields of audio, imaging, video discovery, and semiconductors. We believe that ongoing investment in R&D is required for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve. 
 Today, we have a collection of world-class talent and strong research and development capabilities in various locations throughout the world. Starting with core research, machine learning and advanced algorithm development we continue to focus on IP development and next generation technology solutions. Our ongoing investment in R&D supported by a strong industry network of partners enables us to deliver differentiated, cost effective solutions that enhance the end user experience for an ever-larger universe of addressable markets.

Legislative and Regulatory Actions 
 A number of government and legislative initiatives have been enacted to encourage development and implementation of technologies that protect the rights and intellectual property of the content owners. For example, the U.S. and other countries have adopted certain laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA") and the European Copyright Directive, which are aimed at the prevention of piracy of content and the manufacture and sale of products that circumvent copy protection technologies, such as those covered by our patents.
Compatibility Between Cable Systems and CE Equipment
 The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has been working for over a decade to implement a congressional mandate to create a competitive market for cable television STBs and other devices to access video programming on cable systems (“navigation devices”) and give consumers a choice in the devices used to access such programming, while still allowing the cable systems to have control over the secured access to their systems.
 To meet its statutory obligation without compromising the security of video services, the FCC required cable systems to make available a security element (now known as a CableCARD) separate from the basic navigation device needed to access video program channels. In 2003, the FCC adopted regulations implementing an agreement between cable television system operators and CE manufacturers to facilitate the retail availability of so-called “plug and play” devices that utilize unidirectional CableCARDs, including digital televisions and other digital devices that enable subscribers to access cable television programming without the need for a STB (but without the ability for consumers to use interactive content). In September 2020, the FCC eliminated rules requiring cable providers to support CableCARD. While the cable industry has continued to provide CableCARDs for third-party devices like ours, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any new technical equipment regulations on our business and operations. Current FCC regulations no longer prohibit multi-channel video service providers from deploying navigation devices with combined security and non-security functions, further developments with respect to these issues could impact the availability and/or demand for “plug and play” devices, particularly bi-directional devices and STBs, all of which could affect demand for UXs incorporated in STBs or CE devices.
 General Government Regulation
 We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies that import or export software and technology, including encryption technology, such as the U.S. export control regulations as administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
 We are also subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws that affect companies conducting business on the internet. In addition, because of the increasing popularity of the internet and the growth of online services, laws relating to user privacy, freedom of expression, content, advertising, accessibility, network neutrality, information security and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world. Each jurisdiction may enact different standards, which could impact our ability to deliver data, services or other solutions through the internet.
 We are subject to international laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation) associated with data protection, privacy, and other aspects of our business in Europe and elsewhere and the interpretation and application of data protection laws remains uncertain. In addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws. Further, the application of existing laws regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers can be unclear. The resulting regulation, if any, may alter our ability to target advertising or provide data about the end-users and/or customers and their behavior.
 Additionally, the privacy regulatory landscape in the U.S. changes rapidly and we may become subject to new privacy or cybersecurity regulations. Such laws and regulations could affect our ability to process personal data (in particular, our ability to use certain data for purposes such as risk or fraud avoidance, marketing or advertising), our ability to control our costs by using certain vendors or service providers or our ability to offer certain services in certain jurisdictions. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information and allows for a new cause of action for data breaches. It is unclear how the CCPA will be interpreted, but as currently written, it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data.

In the U.S., service providers have been subject to claims of defamation, libel, invasion of privacy and other data protection claims, torts, unlawful activity, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted or the content generated by users. In addition, several other federal laws could have an impact on our business. For example, the DMCA has provisions that limit, but do not eliminate, our liability for hosting or linking to third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act restricts the ability of service providers to collect information from minors and the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act of 1998 requires service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.
 Human Capital Resources
 The opportunities for our success and growth depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a talented and engaged workforce. In particular, we are competing for technical talent and we need to offer not only robust and attractive compensation packages but also provide broad opportunities for our employees to make an impact, grow, and develop. As of December 31, 2020, we had a global talent base consisting of approximately 1,850 full-time employees.
 To enable our talent to actively contribute to, and have a positive impact on, the overall business and culture, we developed and maintain a set of programs and initiatives. These programs include competitive compensation and benefits offerings, skill and management development, diversity and inclusion initiatives, goal and performance management, and succession planning. In support of these efforts, our Board of Directors monitors these programs and initiatives and provides guidance and feedback as appropriate. Our goal is to provide a work environment that empowers our teams and enables them to enjoy a healthy and productive work-life balance for themselves, their families, and our community. 
 Our incentives are based on merits, and we have a strong pay-for-performance culture. We benchmark our total rewards annually to ensure our compensation and benefit programs remain competitive with industry peers. Our compensation framework for employees reflects a combination of fixed and variable pay including base salary, bonuses, performance awards, and stock-based compensation. We offer employees benefits that vary by country and are designed to meet or exceed local laws and are competitive in the marketplace. 
 We invest in the career growth of our employees by providing a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development. Annual assessments are performed to identify talent needs based on department goals and to evaluate how each function is positioned from a talent perspective. We believe in the principles of a learning organization and strive to provide continuous educational opportunities for our employees. In 2020, we invested in a global online learning platform. More than 200 courses and programs have been created, offering a wide range of skill development opportunities for employees to become more knowledgeable and effective in their roles. Additionally, we also offer customized leadership and management development programs for our management teams.
 We leverage our manager ecosystem, coupled with industry-standard performance management tools, to align corporate goals with employee objectives. Employees are encouraged to create and align individual, functional and team-based goals, track performance against goals, write self-evaluations, and solicit feedback.
 We have demonstrated support and commitment to developing a culture of non-discrimination and embracing diversity and inclusion throughout our workforce.  Our current employee resource groups represent the LGBTQ+ community, the black community, women, and veterans.  We also have formed a Diversity and Inclusion council comprised of all levels of employees and senior executives. The purpose of the council is, among other things, to identify and address issues of diversity and inclusion through multiple and unique perspectives from a diverse group of our employees. In June 2020, we joined the business coalition in support of the Equality Act, a measure that supports federal legislation that would provide the same basic protections to LGBTQ+ people as are provided to other protected groups under federal law. Additionally, we comply fully with California’s board diversity legislation that requires a minimum number of female directors and directors from underrepresented communities.
 We measure employee experience by collecting insight and understanding of engagement and satisfaction. We use an employee engagement survey, executive roundtables, and employee focus groups to solicit input. Task forces are regularly created to identify and address gaps which result in changes to policies and practices and benefits offerings. A recent survey to assess employee well-being during the initial working-from-home period related to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the payment of working-from-home stipend to employees which covered certain costs associated with setting up home offices.
 During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We have:
