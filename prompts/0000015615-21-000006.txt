Industry Trends
Our industry is composed of national, regional and local companies that provide services to customers in a range of industries. We believe the following industry trends affect demand for our services: 
Opportunities in our Communications Segment
Significant advances in technology and rapid innovation in service offerings to data consumers continue to increase demand for faster and more reliable wireless and wireline/fiber communications network services. The amount of network data traffic is experiencing significant and accelerating levels of growth from increased usage of mobile devices, advancements in the “Internet of Things (IoT)” and a significant increase in the use of mobile and remote technologies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has accelerated trends that were underway prior to the pandemic. Increased data usage is expected to significantly increase data traffic, resulting in the need for new and upgraded networks. Contributing to the increase in data usage are video and streaming technologies, ‘smart’ technologies, including ‘Smart City’ and ‘Smart Home’ applications, artificial intelligence and other advanced data services, including video surveillance, robotics, drones, digital health applications and autonomous vehicles, among others. Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) predicts that broadband connection speeds in North America will more than double by 2023, from approximately 55 Mbps in 2018 to over 140 Mbps in 2023, according to its March 2020 Annual Internet Report, 2018-2023.
According to Deloitte & Touche LLP’s (“Deloitte”) 2021 Outlook for the US Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment Industry publication, in 2020, US telecommunications networks were key in driving changes in how people live, work and learn amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, and helped to mitigate the pandemic’s negative effects by keeping people and communities connected. The publication predicts that telecommunications providers will serve as the bedrock for the ability of businesses to recover and thrive in 2021 by continuing to enable new modes of communication. Telecommunications companies are projected to have an even larger role in shaping the future as next generation 5G wireless technology gains traction among both businesses and consumers. 5G, the next generation of wireless and fixed wireless network capacity, is expected to provide a platform for the IoT, which can be harnessed to drive innovation and improvements in healthcare, education, public safety, the development of Smart Cities, Smart Homes and Smart Farming, among many other applications. 5G is expected to provide businesses with significant real-time visibility, insight and control over assets, products and services, with the potential to transform how businesses operate and deliver new products and services.
In response to these growing opportunities, communications service providers (“CSPs”) are expanding, densifying and optimizing current wireless and wireline/fiber communications network capacity, while initiating a build-out of 5G infrastructure. Additionally, changes in CSPs, such as the T-Mobile acquisition of Sprint and the related creation of Dish Network as an additional nationwide CSP, are further accelerating the build-out 
of 5G infrastructure. An August 2019 Gartner, Inc. publication indicates that to achieve nationwide coverage levels, changes to the structure of the network architecture for 5G wireless communications will require a longer period of installation when compared to past generation changes in wireless infrastructure. In order to maintain performance standards as 5G is built-out, CSPs will need to undertake targeted strategic improvements to their 4G legacy networks by upgrading 4G core infrastructure alongside 5G deployment areas. Cisco, in its Annual Internet Report, predicts that 5G devices and connections will be over 10 percent of global mobile devices and connections by 2023. Large scale 5G deployments, which are expected over the next several years, will include additional and improved tower capacity, as well as deployment of numerous higher bandwidth small/micro cells, distributed antenna systems and fiber network expansion to densify network performance.
We believe that nationwide 5G tower deployments, along with the future impact of newly available C-band spectrum, deployment of small/micro cells and fiber network expansion by major carriers in support of 5G will lead to significant demand for 5G telecommunications infrastructure over multiple years. A December 2020 report by Grand View Research indicated that the global 5G infrastructure market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of almost 60% from 2020 to 2027, and a September 2020 publication by Boston Consulting Group projects that U.S. telecommunications companies will invest over $250 billion to build 5G networks from 2020-2025. In August 2020, the Federal Communications Commission’s (the “FCC”) initiatives to speed deployment of 5G technology in the United States through the Facilitate America’s Superiority in 5G Technology, or “FAST” Plan, were upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The FAST Plan is designed to make more spectrum available to the market and encourage implementation of and investment in 5G technology across the United States by streamlining regulatory processes and updating infrastructure policies. During 2019, the FCC completed its first set of high-band airwaves auctions to make spectrum available for 5G wireless, IoT and other advanced spectrum-based services and, in January 2021, the FCC completed a separate auction of significant mid-band 5G spectrum, making a portion of the C-band available in its largest mid-band spectrum auction to date, years ahead of schedule. According to the FCC’s release, this spectrum holds the potential to be prime spectrum for 5G services given its combination of geographic coverage and capacity.
Several initiatives designed to drive development of telecommunications and 5G infrastructure in rural areas are also underway. The Connect America Fund (“CAF”) program is designed to improve the quality and expand the availability of high-speed internet service in rural areas, and in January 2020, the FCC announced its Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”), which is a follow-up initiative to the CAF program. RDOF will make over $20 billion in funding available over the next 10 years to build and connect gigabit broadband speeds in unserved rural areas. Additionally, in October 2020, the FCC established the 5G Fund for Rural America, which will provide up to $9 billion in funding over the next decade to bring 5G wireless broadband connectivity to rural America.
The market for Smart City initiatives, in which cities use IoT technologies to collect and use insights gained from data to manage city assets, resources and services more efficiently, is a developing trend that is expected to accelerate due to the combination of increased data speeds and data capacity capabilities of wireless and wireline networks and developing IoT applications. To address the expected escalating demands for resources of so many residents living, working, driving and interacting with each other, cities are looking at ways to become ‘smarter’ and more efficient in responding to these needs, including through Smart City initiatives to address and improve traffic flow, public safety and energy efficiency. According to CTIA’s Smart Cities Playbook, smart lighting solutions have the potential to save more than $1 billion per year across the United States and smart traffic management systems have the potential to reduce congestion by 40% and save $100 million annually. According to a recent Axios article, cities are projected to invest over $8 billion in smart street lighting technologies over the next ten years. Forbes Magazine in 2019 estimated that two-thirds of cities globally are investing in Smart City technologies, including such technologies as Wi-Fi kiosks, smart lighting solutions, utility meters, smart traffic management systems, video sensors, weather sensors, drone sensors for public safety efforts and radio frequency identification sensors in the pavement. Global spending on Smart City initiatives is expected to total almost $125 billion in 2020, according to a February 2020 report by International Data Corporation.
Smart Home technologies represent a wide range of solutions for monitoring, controlling and automating functions in a home. These technologies are expected to benefit from the global rollout of 5G and improvements in Wi-Fi technologies, which are revolutionizing the delivery of IoT services. According to Mordor Intelligence’s Global Smart Home Market 2020-2025 report, the demand for smart home solutions is expected to increase significantly as consumers look to add smart home technologies such as connected cameras, video doorbells and security systems, energy management solutions and entertainment controls. Mordor Intelligence predicts that the Smart Home market will grow from approximately $80 billion in 2019 to approximately $224 billion in 2025. We believe that opportunities for installation and maintenance of both Smart City and Smart Home technologies will provide our install-to-the-home group opportunities for future growth, providing an offset to declining trends in subscribership for satellite TV.
We believe that we are well-positioned, as one of the largest providers of communications infrastructure services, to substantially benefit from the expected multi-year significant and broad opportunities in the telecommunications market as previously described.
Opportunities in our Clean Energy and Infrastructure Segment
Climate change initiatives and the desire to reduce carbon emissions continued to gain momentum in 2020, continuing the change in the mix of fuel sources used in energy generation toward cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. According to Deloitte’s Industry Outlooks 2021: Power, Utilities & Renewables report, businesses, states, cities and utilities continued to announce decarbonization plans in 2020, with many utilities and their customers announcing and accelerating plans to fully decarbonize over the next three decades. Demand for clean energy sources continues to grow, with renewables reporting rising levels of usage and capacity as well as declining costs. Potential new governmental and policy initiatives, including from the United States rejoining the Paris Agreement, could drive even further growth in renewable energy infrastructure. According to a January 2021 publication by BloombergNEF, global investment in low-carbon energy transition projects totaled $501 billion in 2020, a 9% increase from 2019, with renewables totaling $304 billion of the total global 2020 investment, for which wind and solar were the primary drivers.
Growing corporate initiatives for smaller, standalone distributed generation facilities, together with regulatory and other policy initiatives at the federal, state and municipal levels, have spurred demand for clean energy production from sustainable power sources, including electrical power production from renewable sources such as wind, solar and biomass. Currently, almost 40 states, as well as the District of Columbia and four territories, have adopted renewable portfolio standards (“RPS”) or renewable energy goals. States have created these standards to diversify their energy resources, promote domestic energy production and encourage economic development. According to Deloitte’s 2021 Renewable Energy 
Industry Outlook, rising state renewable portfolio standards, increasing levels of corporate and residential demand, and improving economic competitiveness of renewable sources continue to be key drivers for their growth, with potential future federal policy initiatives, mandates and stimulus providing additional growth drivers. Renewable energy policies have helped to drive the U.S. market for wind, solar and other renewable energy sources. According to BloombergNEF’s January 2021 publication, U.S. investment in renewable energy capacity approximated $49 billion in 2020. In addition, growing efforts to address electric grid resiliency are expected to drive growth in renewables, as utilities and their customers increasingly consider renewable microgrids combined with energy storage solutions to support critical facilities. 
In 2020, renewable energy production experienced record-high levels of penetration. The Department of Energy’s (“DOE”) Annual Energy Outlook 2021 projects that renewable electric generating technologies, such as wind and solar, are expected to represent 60% of new capacity additions through 2050 due to a combination of declining capital costs, expected increases in state RPS targets and current and potential tax incentives. Renewable power generation is expected to contribute over 40% of U.S. power generation capacity by 2050, with solar and wind projected at 47% and 34%, respectively, of the total renewable power generation mix in 2050. Advancing technologies and improvements in cost and scalability of renewable energy projects are making these energy sources increasingly viable. 
As a result of the trends and factors discussed above, we expect a continued drive in demand for construction of renewable infrastructure in the coming years. In addition, we believe that replacement and repowering of existing wind turbines and foundations with next generation, higher efficiency turbines, as well as maintenance of aging wind farms, will provide increased opportunities for wind infrastructure projects.
We believe that industrial plant construction opportunities exist in a wide variety of industries, including in the renewable energy industry, as power companies explore ways to reduce their carbon footprint. The low price and environmental advantage of cleaner burning natural gas is expected to continue to drive demand for gas-fired electrical generating plants and conversions of coal-fired power plants to natural gas. A wide variety of industries may seek to expand, convert or construct new plants to take advantage of this economical, cleaner, lower cost and lower carbon fuel source. Biofuel and biomass as alternative fuel sources also present opportunities for the renewable energy market. Industrial facilities and power plants in the biofuels/biomass, food processing, natural gas and related industries present opportunities as additional domestic energy reserves are produced, transported and processed.
We also provide heavy civil infrastructure construction services, including the construction and maintenance of buildings, roads, bridges, water/sewer systems and other civil infrastructure. We believe that initiatives to upgrade and replace aging infrastructure, along with potential governmental stimulus programs and other policy incentives, should lead to increased investment and future growth opportunities in this area. 
We are one of the leading renewables contractors in North America, with expertise in wind, solar and biomass, as well as construction of industrial and other power plants and heavy civil infrastructure, and we expect to benefit from market trends in these industries.
Opportunities in our Electrical Transmission Segment
The U.S. electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure (the “grid”) is composed of a network of electric generating facilities, high voltage transmission lines, substations and distribution lines that bring power to homes and businesses. The grid will continue to require significant ongoing maintenance, upgrade and expansion to continue delivery of reliable and affordable power. This will include strengthening aging infrastructure, addressing future grid resiliency and modernization efforts (“Smart Grid”) and adapting to changing energy supply and distribution requirements. According to a December 2020 IBIS World report, U.S. industry revenue for construction and repair work on electric power transmission infrastructure is projected to approximate $40 billion in 2020. While overall industry activity in 2020 was negatively affected by restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect future growth in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure from projects to digitize, modernize, harden and secure the grid against increasing levels of disruption from natural and man-made disasters, including extreme weather events, wildfires and potential cyber-attacks, as well as to address changing energy supply requirements and grid reliability.
Clean energy production trends are expected to lead to increased investment in electric infrastructure, with a changing fuel mix that is moving toward cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, such as natural gas and renewables. Deloitte’s 2021 Power and Utilities Industry Outlook reported intermittent record-high levels of renewable energy production in 2020. Additionally, the report indicated that many utilities and their customers announced plans in 2020 to fully decarbonize over the next three decades, with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic helping to drive industry convergence toward energy transition. These trends, along with potential changes in governmental policy toward national net zero carbon emission targets, are expected to drive significant future investment in electric infrastructure. According to the DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2021, the percentage of U.S. electricity generated by renewable sources is expected to double to over 40% by 2050. Renewable electric generating technologies are expected to represent 60% of new capacity additions through 2050, with the balance coming almost entirely from natural gas. The expected growth in electrical power generation from renewable energy sources will require significant investment in transmission lines, as wind, solar and other renewable power generation resources are typically located in remote areas of the country, far from industrial users and major population centers. Growth in electrical power generation from renewable sources in the U.S. will also require grid updates to provide for storage of electricity from renewable energy sources and capabilities that can accommodate supply and demand for these new energy sources.
Future demand for electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure is also expected to result from ‘Smart Utility’ initiatives, which seek to address growing populations, environmental goals and the need to optimize resources, as well as electric vehicles, as consumers and automakers increasingly shift toward electric vehicle technologies.
According to the DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2021, approximately 760 net gigawatts of new electricity generating capacity are expected to be added in the U.S. through 2050, requiring significant investment in transmission and distribution by electric utility companies. We believe significant capital investment in the transmission and distribution system will continue to be required to meet the above-mentioned needs, and that we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends.
Opportunities in our Oil and Gas Segment
We are one of the largest pipeline contractors in North America, with a balanced portfolio of service offerings, including union and non-union services. Our pipeline offerings include the construction and maintenance of large diameter (“long-haul”) pipeline, midstream pipeline, gathering lines and related compressor, pumping stations and treatment plants, as well as gas utility distribution services and pipeline integrity maintenance, including replacement and rehabilitation of aging infrastructure. 
Disruptions in economic activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have reduced overall demand for fossil energy products, affecting commodity production and price levels, and negatively affecting demand for oil, natural gas and product pipeline construction activity. While we expect energy consumption and related demand to re-accelerate as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic recede, the expected cost, time and complexity for the construction of new long-haul large diameter pipeline projects have increased due to regulatory, judicial and environmental challenges, as well as the impact of recent or future governmental actions. Despite these trends, our oil and gas pipeline backlog remains strong as of December 31, 2020, and we anticipate having significant long-haul construction project work in 2021, and likely into 2022, from existing long-haul pipeline project awards. The effect that the above mentioned trends may have on future long-haul large diameter project awards, or the timing of future project work, however, is uncertain. 
We believe that energy commodity production in the United States will continue at elevated levels for the next several years, and that this will require additional investment in midstream pipeline construction, gathering lines and related compressor, pumping stations and treatment plants, as the sources of production change within and across multiple geographic areas, such as the Permian, Bakken and Marcellus/Utica basins. We also expect that natural gas power generation will remain a fuel of choice for both primary power generation and baseload backup power generation to support intermittent clean energy sources, and this trend will drive the growth of natural gas as a source of base load lower-carbon power generation, both in the U.S. and abroad. According to the DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2021, U.S. natural gas was the leading fuel type for electric power generation in 2020, representing 40% of total electric power generation, more than double the rates of both coal and hydroelectric power. We believe that trends in natural gas power generation will require continued construction of pipeline infrastructure to provide fuel safely and efficiently to these facilities. In addition, according to the DOE’s Short-Term Energy Outlook December 2020 report, the United States continues to be a net exporter of natural gas, and industry reporting indicates that demand for liquified natural gas (“LNG”) exports has risen substantially in recent years, driven in part by the easing of certain export regulations. This trend is expected to drive construction of pipeline infrastructure for the transport of LNG to coastal export facilities in North America. Additionally, we believe that gas utility distribution spending for replacement and rehabilitation of aging infrastructure will accelerate over the next several years due to regulatory, sustainability and safety concerns. Similarly, we expect that aging oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure will increasingly require replacement lines and pipeline integrity services as our customers look to enhance the safety, productivity and lives of existing pipeline infrastructure. 
We believe that the above-mentioned trends will support continued levels of future project activity across multiple service offerings we provide and that we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends.

We believe that we have sufficient capital resources to fund our planned operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.2 billion of borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, with aggregate borrowing commitments of $1.75 billion under our senior secured credit facility and $600 million of 4.50% senior notes due 2028. We may consider opportunities to borrow additional funds, or to refinance, repurchase or retire outstanding debt or repurchase shares as part of our ongoing capital structure evaluation. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources,” for details pertaining to our debt instrument and share repurchase activities.
Leverage Core Performance and Expertise through Strategic Acquisitions and Other Arrangements. We may pursue selected acquisitions, investments and strategic arrangements that allow us to expand our operations, service offerings, customer base or geographic reach. We have diversified our business and expanded our service offerings and geographic footprint in recent years, both organically and through acquisition. In order to maximize their potential, our strategy is to integrate acquired businesses into our operations and internal control environment in a timely and efficient manner. We evaluate our business on a regular basis, and from time to time, we may divest certain businesses or assets, or curtail selected business activities or operations that do not produce adequate revenue or margin or that no longer fit within our long-term business strategy.
Services
Our core services are the engineering, building, installing, maintaining and upgrading of infrastructure, primarily for communications, power generation, pipeline and utility customers. We provide similar services to each of these customers, including: 
Build. We build infrastructure projects for customers across a range of industries. We specialize in building underground and overhead distribution systems, including trenches, conduits, cell towers, cable and power lines, which provide wireless and wireline/fiber communications; clean energy infrastructure, including renewable energy; natural gas, crude oil and refined product transport pipelines; electrical power generation, 
transmission and distribution systems; heavy industrial plants; compressor and pump stations and treatment plants; water and sewer infrastructure, including water pipelines; and other civil construction infrastructure.
Install. We install electrical and other energy distribution and transmission systems, power generation facilities, buried and aerial fiber optic and other cables, satellite dishes, home automation and energy management solutions in a variety of environments for our customers. In connection with our installation work, we deploy and manage network connections that involve our customers’ hardware, software and network equipment. 
Maintain and Upgrade. We offer 24 hour/365 days-a-year maintenance and upgrade support to our customers. Our comprehensive service offerings include the regular maintenance of our customers’ distribution facilities, networks and infrastructure, including communications, power generation, pipeline, electrical distribution and transmission and heavy civil infrastructure. We also provide emergency services for accidents or storm damage. Our upgrade work ranges from routine replacements and upgrades to major overhauls. 
Customers
We have longstanding relationships with many customers, and often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which are generally multi-year agreements. Our master service agreements are typically exclusive up to a specified dollar amount per work order for each defined geographic area, but do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us. Work performed under master service and other service agreements is usually generated through work orders, each of which is performed for a fixed fee. Services provided under these agreements range from engineering, project management and installation work to maintenance and upgrade services. Master service and other service agreements are frequently awarded on a competitive bidding basis, although customers are sometimes willing to negotiate contract extensions beyond their original terms without re-bidding. Our master service and other service agreements have various terms, depending upon the nature of the services provided, and typically provide for termination on short or no advance notice. For each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, revenue derived from projects performed under master service and other service agreements totaled 36% of consolidated revenue, and in 2018, totaled 35%. 
The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs requiring the construction and installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an entire infrastructure system. Customers are billed with varying frequency, the timing of which is generally dependent upon advance billing terms, milestone billings based on completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Under the typical payment terms of master and other service agreements and contracts for specific projects, the customer makes progress payments based on quantifiable measures of performance as defined in the agreements. Some of our contracts include retainage provisions, under which a portion of the contract amount (generally, from 5% to 10% of billings) can be retained by the customer until final contract settlement. 
We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise and reputation for customer service, as well as the relationships developed between our customers and our senior management and project management teams are important to our being retained by our customers. See Note 13 - Segments and Related Information and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference, for customer concentration information. 
Backlog
Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the next 18 months from future work on uncompleted construction contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. Our estimated backlog also includes amounts under master service and other service agreements and includes our proportionate share of estimated revenue from proportionately consolidated non-controlled contractual joint ventures. Estimated backlog for work under master service and other service agreements is determined based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. Based on current expectations of our customers’ requirements, we expect to realize approximately 80% of our estimated year end 2020 backlog in 2021. The following table presents 18-month estimated backlog by reportable segment, as of the dates indicated:

Reportable Segment (in millions): | December 31, 2020 | | September 30, 2020 | | December 31, 2019
Communications | $ | 3,806 | | | $ | 3,853 | | $ | 4,228
Clean Energy and Infrastructure | 1,025 | | | 891 | | | 1,289
Oil and Gas | 2,486 | | | 2,413 | | | 1,929
Electrical Transmission | 557 | | | 545 | | | 512 
Other | — | | | 0 | | | 1 
Estimated 18-month backlog | $ | 7,874 | | | $ | 7,702 | | $ | 7,959

As of December 31, 2020, 45% of our backlog is attributable to amounts under master service or other service agreements, pursuant to which our customers are not contractually committed to purchase a minimum amount of services. Most of these agreements can be canceled on short or no advance notice. Timing of revenue for construction and installation projects included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of customer, regulatory or other delays or cancellations, including from the potential adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity, and/or other project-related factors. These changes could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. We occasionally experience postponements, cancellations and reductions in expected future work from master service agreements and/or construction projects due to changes in our customers’ spending plans, market volatility, changes in governmental permitting, regulatory delays and/or other factors. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or if actual results will be consistent with the estimates included in our forecasts. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings. 
Backlog is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not, however, be comparable to the methodologies used by others. Backlog differs from the amount of our remaining performance obligations, which are described in Note 1 - Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. As of December 31, 2020, total 18-month backlog differed from the amount of our remaining performance obligations due primarily to the inclusion of $3.1 billion of estimated future revenue under master service and other service agreements within our backlog estimates, as described above, and the exclusion of approximately $0.2 billion of remaining performance obligations and estimated future revenue under master service and other service agreements in excess of 18 months, which amount is not included in the backlog estimates above. Backlog expected to be realized in 2021 differed from the amount of remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized for the same period due primarily to the inclusion of approximately $1.7 billion of estimated future revenue under master service and other service agreements that is included within the related backlog estimate.
Sales and Marketing
Our customers increasingly require resources from multiple disciplines. Therefore, our subsidiary services companies market their services not only individually, but also in combination with other companies, including other MasTec companies and independent companies, to provide what we believe are the most efficient and effective solutions to meet our customers’ demands. Through our unified MasTec® brand and an integrated organizational structure designed to permit rapid deployment of labor, equipment and materials, we are able to quickly and efficiently allocate resources to meet customer needs. We offer services that are branded under the MasTec® service mark and other service marks. 
We have developed a marketing plan emphasizing the MasTec® registered service mark and trade names of certain acquired companies, as well as an integrated service offering to position ourselves as a provider of a full range of service solutions, providing services including installation as well as sophisticated engineering, design and integration. We believe our longstanding relationships with customers and our reputation for reliability and efficiency facilitate our recurring business. Our marketing efforts are principally carried out by the management of our business units and project groups in coordination with our corporate business development organization. Our management team has many years of industry experience, both at the service provider level, and in some cases, with the customers we serve. Our business unit and project group managers market directly to existing and potential customers for new contracts and also seek our inclusion on lists of vendors invited to submit proposals for service agreements and individual projects. We also market our services in conjunction with certain business partners, strategic investments and arrangements. Our executive management supplements these efforts at the national and international level. 
Safety and Insurance/Risk Management
We have a proactive safety culture and we strive to instill and enforce safe work habits in our employees. Our employees are required to participate in training programs relevant to their employment, including all those required by law. We actively train our workforce in everyday safety practices and provide detailed guidelines that are required to be followed as work tasks are contemplated and completed. Training programs are tailored to an employee’s job function, responsibilities and level of experience and are designed in accordance with industry best practices and standards. We evaluate employees in part based upon their safety records and the safety records of the employees they supervise. Team members are responsible for preventing incidents, injuries and occupational illnesses, and our project leadership team is tasked with ensuring that projects are accomplished in a safe, productive, environmentally and quality-focused manner. Our business units have established robust safety programs to monitor and improve compliance with safety procedures and regulations, and through our risk management programs, we educate our staff, subcontractors and suppliers on safety matters. We also provide company-wide training where appropriate, including for information technology and cyber security, emergency preparedness and other potential workplace hazards, and workplace and employee awareness programs. 
Our business involves the use of heavy equipment and exposure to potentially dangerous workplace conditions. While we are committed to operating safely and prudently, we are subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries that occur in connection with our work. Our insurance policies are subject to high deductibles and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. We maintain insurance policies for workers’ compensation, general liability and automobile liability that are subject to per claim deductibles. We also maintain excess umbrella coverage and an insurance policy with respect to employee group medical claims, which is subject to annual per employee maximum losses. We are required to post collateral to certain of our insurance carriers, generally in the form of letters of credit, surety bonds and cash. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. 
Suppliers, Materials and Working Capital
Under many of our contracts, our customers provide the necessary materials and supplies for projects and we are responsible for the installation of, but not the cost or warranty of those materials. Under certain other projects, we purchase the necessary materials and supplies on behalf of our customers from third-party providers. We are not dependent on any one vendor and have not experienced significant difficulty in obtaining project-related materials or supplies as and when required for the projects we manage. 
We utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help us manage our work flow. Our independent contractors typically provide their own vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. We are not dependent on any one independent contractor. We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, including the spending patterns of our customers and the effects of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work, both of which can influence the timing of spending to support related customer demand. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Working Capital,” which is incorporated by reference. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate, ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms, including Quanta Services, Inc., MYR Group, Inc., Dycom Industries, Inc., Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Primoris Services Corporation, Pike Electric, Inc., Bechtel Corporation, D.H. Blattner & Sons, Inc., M.A. Mortenson Company, Black & Veatch and Nexius.
Certain barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate, including adequate financial resources, technical expertise, high safety ratings and a proven track record of operational success. Some of our customers employ their own personnel to perform infrastructure services of the type we provide. We compete based upon our industry experience, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, geographic presence, industry reputation, safety record and reputation for customer service. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they award most of their work through a bid process, and price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected. 
Regulation, Environmental and Climate Change Matters
We are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally, including laws and regulations related to labor relations, wages, worker safety and environmental protection. While many of our customers operate in regulated industries (for example, utilities regulated by the public service commission or communications companies regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), we are not generally subject to such regulation and oversight. 
In addition to environmental laws and regulations, as a contractor, our operations are subject to various laws, including: 
•    regulations related to worker safety and health, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and state equivalents; 
•regulations related to vehicle registrations, including those of the states and the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”); 
•    contractor licensing requirements; 
•    permitting and inspection requirements; and
•    building and electrical codes.
We are also subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and programs, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, laws governing emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil, and programs related to the protection of endangered species and critical habitats. In particular, our oil and gas related activities require careful adherence to environmental regulations because such operations may have impacts on groundwater, surface waters and other environmentally sensitive areas. Similarly, our electrical transmission and distribution construction operations often require us to operate in remote areas involving environmentally sensitive habitats.
We have a substantial investment in construction equipment that utilizes fuel. Any changes in laws requiring us to use equipment that runs on alternative fuels could require a significant investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business. 
In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations. Our contracts with customers may also impose liabilities on us regarding environmental issues that arise through the performance of our services. From time to time, we may incur unanticipated and substantial costs and obligations related to environmental compliance and/or remediation matters. 
We believe we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with all applicable regulatory and environmental requirements. We could, however, incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with such requirements.
The potential effects of climate change on our operations is highly uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changes in rainfall patterns, storm patterns and intensities and temperature levels. Our operating results are significantly influenced by weather. Therefore, major changes in weather patterns could have a significant effect on our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in significantly more adverse weather conditions in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity, which could negatively affect our revenue and profitability. Climate change could also affect our customers and the projects that they award. Demand for power projects, underground pipelines or other projects could be negatively affected by significant changes in weather or from legislation or regulations governing climate change.
Financial Information About Geographic Areas
We operate throughout North America, primarily in the United States and Canada. See Note 13 - Segments and Related Information in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. 
Human Capital Management
At MasTec, our employees are an integral part of our growth and success. MasTec began as a family business, and every member of the MasTec team is considered part of the MasTec family. The safety, health and welfare of our employees is at the heart of our operations. We are committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace and value the diverse and varied perspectives and experiences of our employees. We believe that our commitment to our employees, together with our team culture, fosters an environment of strong employee engagement. When our employees are safe, healthy and engaged, we are most productive. We believe that our employees and our customers benefit from the collective and well-coordinated efforts that result from effective employee engagement, teamwork and collaboration, which, in turn, allows us to deliver the highest level of excellence to our stakeholders. 
For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2020, we had an average of approximately 18,000 employees, of which approximately 1,700 were represented by unions or were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 97% of our employees are located in the U.S.
Safety. Safety is a core value at MasTec. It is a mindset that permeates all aspects of our operations, and an attitude that our employees exhibit, strongly and openly. We recognize the need of our workforce to have a safe workplace and are committed to maintaining a strong and sustainable safety culture within our organization. We continually evaluate our safety programs to protect our most important asset – our team members. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges in many parts of our business and operations, including with respect to keeping our employees safe. Accordingly, we have adjusted our standard operating procedures within our business operations to ensure employee and customer safety and are continually monitoring evolving health guidelines and responding to changes as appropriate. We have also developed human resource guidance to assist our employees. 
We have a proactive safety culture, and our safety leadership structure is designed to create accountability within each of our businesses and at the corporate level, including continuously monitoring, reporting and addressing our key safety performance indicators. Our “Zero Harm” culture is fundamental to our goal of world class safety performance, and we work to instill safety values in every team member, such that safe behavior becomes instinctive and automatic. We strive continuously to improve our safety performance. We provide regular safety training and skill-level improvement programs and, through our risk management programs and other safety initiatives, we educate our staff, subcontractors and suppliers on safety matters. We have memberships and participate in numerous safety and other organizations that promote industry safety. Our safety performance is periodically recognized by our customers as well as by safety organizations.
Health and Wellness. Encouraging good health and following a healthy lifestyle is a MasTec philosophy. We encourage all our employees to take an active role in living a healthy lifestyle and offer wellness tools and resources to help achieve and maintain good health. We offer a comprehensive and flexible benefits program, including medical, dental, vision and prescription insurance, as well as access to telehealth services, which we expanded in 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic to assist employees with medical and mental health matters. In addition, to help our employees build a financially secure future, we offer a 401(k) plan with matching benefits, an employee stock purchase plan, life and disability insurance plans and a flexible spending account to help employees cover medical expenses. We also offer employees support for personal and work-life issues, including health, legal and financial matters.
Professional and Career Development. We believe that professional development is essential to the success of our business, as it drives employee engagement and ensures that our team members have the requisite skills and training to deliver the highest level of excellence to our customers. We invest significant resources in education, certification, training programs, and other professional development opportunities, including apprenticeship- and leadership-oriented training programs, tuition reimbursement for qualified training programs, sponsored attendance at industry conferences, departmental and divisional leadership conferences, employee training centers and advancement opportunities within and across businesses and divisions. These programs are designed to create high performing teams, improve productivity, positively affect employee motivation and retention and further enhance career development opportunities. We believe that our team culture, along with competitive salary and benefits packages and our focus on employee training and career development, including opportunities for promotion and mobility within our organization, helps us to attract and retain a diverse and experienced workforce.
Diversity and Inclusion. At MasTec, we are committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace and to fostering an environment where our employees can freely bring diverse perspectives and varied experiences to work. We seek to attract the best talent and foster a culture of inclusion, teamwork, support and empowerment where all talented individuals have access to opportunities and can achieve success. Our commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion, together with our culture of belonging allows us to recruit and retain highly talented employees so that we are able to deliver exceptional results to our customers. In 2020, 49% of our overall U.S. workforce and 43% of our U.S. management team was represented by women and minorities. 
Certain of our businesses have incorporated the use of annual diversity assessments and goal setting targets to expand diversity within our management and employee teams, and we expect to continue in these efforts. We also have an extensive military veteran workforce, and actively engage in outreach programs tailored to military veterans.
