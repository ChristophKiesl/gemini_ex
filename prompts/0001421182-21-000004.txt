Overview

We are a leading North American producer of coated paper, shipped in both roll and sheet formats, which is used primarily in printing applications to produce high-end advertising brochures, catalogs and magazines among other media and marketing publications as well as specialty and packaging applications. We also produce and sell Northern Bleached Hardwood Kraft, or “NBHK” pulp, which is used to manufacture printing and writing paper grades and tissue products.
As of the date of this report, we operate three paper machines at our mill in Escanaba, Michigan and one paper machine and one NBHK pulp machine at our mill in Quinnesec, Michigan. The mills are fully integrated, in that they produce the majority of the pulp and energy needed for their paper production, and they are located in close proximity to the major printing markets. The mills have an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately 1,400,000 tons of paper and market NBHK pulp. We also operate a sheeting facility in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin to convert paper produced at our Michigan mills to sheets for the commercial print market.
We sell and market our products to approximately 200 customers which comprise approximately 1,100 end-user accounts. We have long-standing relationships with many leading paper merchants, commercial printers, brokers, magazine and catalog publishers, and specialty retail merchandisers. Our relationships with many of our large customers average more than 20 years. We reach end-users through several distribution channels, including direct sales, commercial printers, paper merchants and brokers. Our NBHK pulp sales are handled through direct relationships and brokers.
Recent Developments
Sale of Androscoggin Mill and Stevens Point Mill
On November 11, 2019, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement, or the “Purchase Agreement,” with Pixelle Specialty Solution LLC, or “Pixelle,” whereby we agreed to sell to Pixelle, or the “Pixelle Sale,” or "Sale of Androscoggin/
Stevens Point Mills," all of the outstanding membership interests in Verso Androscoggin, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Verso and the entity that, as of the closing date of the Pixelle Sale, held all the assets primarily related to Verso’s Androscoggin Mill located in Jay, Maine, and Stevens Point Mill, located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. The transaction was approved by Verso’s stockholders on January 31, 2020, and closed on February 10, 2020. As consideration for the Pixelle Sale, we received $352 million in cash, which reflected certain adjustments related to our estimates of cash, indebtedness and working capital of Verso Androscoggin, LLC and Pixelle assumed $37 million of Verso’s unfunded pension liabilities, which reflected certain adjustments in connection with the completed transfer of the unfunded pension liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Pixelle Sale reduced the aggregate annual production capacity of our mills by approximately 660,000 tons. The Androscoggin and Stevens Point mills together represented approximately 22% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Duluth and Wisconsin Rapids Mills
On June 9, 2020, we announced plans to indefinitely idle our mills in Duluth, Minnesota and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, while exploring viable and sustainable alternatives for both mills. Those alternatives included restarting, selling or permanently closing one or both mills. To assist in evaluating the possible sale of these idled mills, we have been working with outside advisors. Our decision to reduce production capacity was driven by the accelerated decline in graphic paper demand, primarily resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The “stay-at-home” and other orders related to the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly reduced the use of print advertising in various industries, including retail, sports, entertainment and tourism. The production capacity of the Duluth Mill is approximately 270,000 tons of supercalendered/packaging paper and the production capacity of the Wisconsin Rapids Mill is approximately 540,000 tons of coated and packaging paper. We idled production at the Duluth Mill on July 1, 2020 and at the Wisconsin Rapids Mill on July 27, 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, we recognized $3 million in severance and benefit costs, included in Costs of products sold, associated with the idling of our Duluth Mill and in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized $5 million in severance and benefit costs, included in Costs of products sold, associated with the idling of our Wisconsin Rapids Mill. We continue to operate the facility at our Wisconsin Rapids Mill to convert paper produced at our Quinnesec and Escanaba mills to sheets for the commercial print market.
On December 31, 2020, we decided to permanently shut down our paper mill in Duluth, Minnesota while continuing with efforts to sell the mill. We furloughed approximately 190 employees when the mill was idled in July 2020, while a smaller group of approximately 35 employees remained at the mill to maintain critical systems. In connection with the closure of the Duluth Mill, we recognized $65 million of accelerated depreciation which is included in Depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we recognized $6 million in charges associated with certain contract termination, write-off of property, plant and equipment, spare parts and inventory, and $1 million in additional severance and related benefits in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to a further reduction in the remaining employees.
On February 8, 2021, we decided to permanently shut down the No. 14 paper machine and certain other long-lived assets at our paper mill in Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, while continuing to explore viable and sustainable alternatives with the remaining assets, including our converting operations, No. 16 paper machine and other remaining long-lived assets. This decision will permanently reduce our total annual production capacity by 185,000 tons of coated paper. We furloughed approximately 700 employees when the Wisconsin Rapids Mill was idled in July 2020 and do not expect to further reduce the number of employees remaining at the mill. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect to recognize $95 million to $105 million of accelerated depreciation and pre-tax non-cash charges associated with the No. 14 paper machine and certain other long-lived assets.
Luke Mill
On April 30, 2019, we announced the permanent shutdown of our paper mill in Luke, Maryland in response to the continuing decline in customer demand for the grades of coated freesheet paper produced at the Luke Mill, along with rising input costs, a significant influx of imports and rising compliance costs and infrastructure challenges associated with environmental regulation. We completed the shutdown and closure of the Luke Mill in June 2019, which reduced our coated freesheet production capacity by approximately 450,000 tons and eliminated approximately 675 positions.
On August 1, 2020, we entered into an equipment purchase agreement with Halkali Kagit Karton Sanayi ve Tic. A.S., a company organized under the laws of Turkey, whereby we agreed to sell, and the buyer agreed to purchase, certain equipment at our Luke Mill, primarily including two paper machines. The purchase price was $11 million in cash due at various milestones. We received $8 million in non-refundable deposits associated with the sale during the year ended December 31, 2020, and an additional $1 million in the first quarter of 2021. We expect to receive an additional $1 million in the second quarter of 2021 and the final payment of $1 million by the third quarter of 2021. The closing of the equipment purchase, including the transfer of title and ownership of the equipment to the buyer, will occur upon satisfactory completion of the disassembly and removal of the equipment and the receipt, by us, of all payments due from the buyer.
On October 30, 2020, we received $4 million of cash proceeds for the sale of ancillary land associated with our Luke Mill with a net book value of $4 million.
We have evaluated the remaining assets of our Luke Mill and have received a letter of intent to purchase these assets. Negotiations for a purchase agreement are ongoing.
Changes to Directors and Officers
On January 30, 2020, we entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Lapetus Capital II LLC together with its affiliates, including Atlas Holdings LLC, or “Atlas,” and Blue Wolf Capital Advisors IV, LLC together with its affiliates, or “Blue Wolf,” 
and certain of their respective affiliates, which settled the proxy contest with respect to our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on January 31, 2020, or the “2019 Annual Meeting.”
Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, Verso, Atlas and Blue Wolf agreed to take the necessary actions for Verso’s Board of Directors to consist of the following individuals immediately after our 2019 Annual Meeting: Dr. Robert K. Beckler, Marvin Cooper, Sean T. Erwin, Jeffrey E. Kirt, Randy J. Nebel, Nancy M. Taylor and Adam St. John. Immediately following the certification of voting result of the 2019 Annual Meeting on February 6, 2020, Marvin Cooper was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Board. 
On September 30, 2020, Adam St. John resigned from his role as President and Chief Executive Officer and from our Board of Directors and Randy J. Nebel, a member of our Board of Directors, was appointed as our interim President and Chief Executive Officer. On January 27, 2021, the Board of Directors appointed Randy J. Nebel as Verso’s President and Chief Executive Officer.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The outbreak of COVID-19, which was declared by the World Health Organization to be a global pandemic, is impacting worldwide economic activity. In an effort to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19, government and health authorities around the world have taken extraordinary and wide-ranging actions, including orders to close all businesses not deemed essential, quarantines and “stay-at-home” orders. Although some of these governmental restrictions have since been lifted or scaled back, recent surges of COVID-19 and the discovery of new variants of the virus may lead to restrictions being implemented in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We serve as an essential manufacturing business and, as a result, we have continued to be operational during this time in order to meet the ongoing needs of our customers, including those in other essential business sectors, which provide food, medical and hygiene products needed in a global health crisis. The guidelines and orders enacted by federal, state and local governments have impacted demand from retailers, political campaigns, and sports and entertainment events, driving reduced purchases of printed materials and substantially impacting our graphic paper business.
Our COVID-19 preparedness and response team has been monitoring the pandemic and related events and preparing and implementing responses in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or “CDC,” and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or “OSHA,” recommendations as well as federal, state and local guidelines.
While we cannot reasonably estimate the full impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, the pandemic will continue to have a negative impact on our business and financial results. The full extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among others, the duration of the outbreak, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken, especially those by governmental authorities, to contain its spread or treat its impact including the availability, effectiveness and/or public acceptance of any U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or “FDA,” approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Share Repurchase Authorization
On February 26, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized up to $250 million of net proceeds from the Pixelle Sale to be used to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock through open market purchases and 10b-5 programs under the share repurchase authorization at a weighted average cost of $13.39 per share.
In conjunction with the declaration of the special cash dividend of $3.00 per share, or $101 million, on August 5, 2020, our Board of Directors reduced the total amount of the share repurchase authorization from $250 million to $150 million. As of December 31, 2020, $121 million of the $150 million authorized remained.
Industry

Coated paper is used primarily in media and marketing applications, including catalogs, magazines and commercial printing applications, which include high-end advertising brochures and direct mail advertising. Demand is generally driven by North American advertising and print media trends, which in turn have historically been correlated with growth in gross domestic product. The coated paper industry has been facing a decline in demand driven primarily by the growth in digital media (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Industry - The paper industry has been facing a long-term structural decline and our profitability may continue to be adversely impacted by such decline”).
In North America, coated paper is classified by brightness and falls into five grades, labeled No. 1 to No. 5, with No. 1 having the highest brightness level and No. 5 having the lowest brightness level. Papers graded No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 are typically coated freesheet grades. No. 4 and No. 5 papers are predominantly grades containing groundwood. Coated groundwood grades are the preferred grades for catalogs and magazines, while coated freesheet is more commonly used in commercial print applications.
Within the paper industry, specialty paper consists of products which are given unique characteristics in their manufacturing, converting or processing and that have properties suitable for special purposes or custom engineered applications. Specialty paper has unique functional properties and is usually produced in relatively small quantities for a specific product, function or end-use requirement. Commercial and development activities rely largely on defining the unique characteristics of an application, in contrast with other substrates. We have focused on label and converting, flexible packaging and technical paper applications within the specialty paper market. 
While the structural decline of our products accelerated in 2020, we saw a significant reduction in capacity through the year. We have also seen improved demand in the second half of the year, specifically in the North American commercial print market. This improved demand, along with lower imports, resulted in stronger shipments from North American mills.
Products

We manufacture paper products that serve the graphic and specialty paper markets. In addition, we manufacture pulp for both internal use and external sales.
Graphic paper. The graphic paper market includes coated freesheet, uncoated freesheet, coated groundwood and supercalendered paper. We produce Coated Freesheet and Coated Groundwood No. 4 grades for our customers. Freesheet paper is made from bleached kraft pulp, which is produced using a chemical process to break apart wood fibers and dissolve impurities such as lignin. The use of bleached kraft pulp results in a bright, smooth paper with excellent print qualities. Coated freesheet paper contains primarily kraft pulp with less than 10% mechanical pulp in its composition, and is therefore well-suited for high-end commercial applications, premium magazines, catalogs and direct mail. Groundwood paper includes a fiber component produced through a mechanical pulping process. The use of such fiber results in a bulkier and more opaque paper that is better suited for applications where lighter weights and/or higher stiffness are required. In addition to mechanical pulp, groundwood paper typically includes a kraft pulp component to improve brightness and print quality. Groundwood paper is coated (coated groundwood) for higher quality applications such as catalogs and magazines. Graphic paper revenues have been declining primarily due to the focus on digital media as opposed to traditional print advertising. Revenues from our graphic paper sales represented 62%, 60% and 66% of our total annual net sales for 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Specialty paper. We offer product solutions for our customers by producing paper grades used as labels for packaging, canned goods and other related applications. Revenues from our specialty paper sales represented 31%, 31% and 20% of our total annual net sales for 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Packaging paper. We produce heavy weight coated freesheet grades for use in higher-end packaging and printing applications such as greeting cards, book covers, folders, labels and point-of-purchase displays. Revenues from our packaging paper sales represented 2%, 4% and 5% of our total annual net sales for 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Pulp. We produce and sell Northern Bleached Hardwood Kraft, or “NBHK” pulp. NBHK pulp is produced through the chemical kraft process using hardwoods. Hardwoods typically have shorter length fibers than softwoods and are used in a variety of end-use applications. NBHK describes pulp produced using a chemical process, whereby hardwood chips are combined with chemicals and steam to separate the wood fibers. The fibers are then washed and pressure screened to remove the chemicals and lignin which originally held the fibers together. Finally, the pulp is bleached to the necessary whiteness and brightness. NBHK pulp is used in applications where a brighter and whiter fiber based product is required. We can also offer Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft pulp, de-inked recycled pulp and unbleached virgin kraft pulp to help meet specific customer requirements. Revenues from our pulp sales represented 5%, 5% and 9% of our total annual net sales for 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Manufacturing
As of the date of this report, we operate three paper machines at our mill in Escanaba, Michigan, one paper machine and one NBHK pulp machine at our mill in Quinnesec, Michigan, and a sheeting facility in Wisconsin. The mills have an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately 1,400,000 tons of paper and market NBHK pulp. In 2019, we shut down our paper mill in Luke, Maryland and agreed to sell our Androscoggin Mill located in Jay, Maine and our Stevens Point Mill located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin to Pixelle, which closed on February 10, 2020. In July 2020, we indefinitely idled our mills in Duluth, Minnesota and Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, while exploring viable and sustainable alternatives for both mills. Our facilities are strategically located within close proximity to major publication printing customers, which affords us the ability to deliver our products more quickly and cost-effectively.
The following table provides key information about our mills and operating paper machines’ capacity as of the date of this report.

Mill/Location | Product/Paper Grades | Paper/Market PulpMachines | | Annual ProductionCapacity(in tons)
Duluth, Minnesota (closed)(1) | Supercalendered papers | | 1 | | 270,000
Escanaba, Michigan | Coated, specialty and uncoated paper | | 3 | | 730,000
Quinnesec, Michigan | Coated paper and market pulp | | 2 | | 670,000
Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin (idled)(2) | Coated and packaging papers | | 2 | | 540,000

(1) Duluth Mill annual paper production capacity of 270,000 tons is not included in our total paper production capacity.
(2) Wisconsin Rapids Mill annual paper production capacity of 540,000 is not included in our total paper production capacity. On February 8, 2021, we decided to permanently shut down the No. 14 paper machine and certain other long-lived assets at our Wisconsin Rapids Mill, which will permanently reduce annual production capacity by approximately 185,000 tons of coated paper.
The basic raw material of the papermaking process is wood pulp. The first stage of papermaking involves converting trees to pulp through either a mechanical or chemical process. Before trees can be processed into pulp, they are passed through a debarking drum to remove the bark and be chipped. Once separated, the bark is burned as fuel in bark boilers. The trees are composed of small cellulose fibers which are bound together by a glue-like substance called lignin. The cellulose fibers are then separated from each other through either a mechanical or a kraft pulping process.

After the pulping phase, the fiber furnish is delivered onto the forming fabric of the paper machine. On the forming fabric, the fibers become interlaced, forming a mat of paper, and much of the water is extracted. The paper web then goes through a pressing and drying process to extract the remaining water. After drying, the web goes through a series of on machine and off machine finishing and converting processes that impact product specific attributes to ensure excellent downstream performance. Finally, the paper is wrapped, labeled and shipped.
Our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Consolidated Water Power Company, or “CWPCo,” has 33.3 megawatts of generating capacity on 39 generators located in five hydroelectric plants on the Wisconsin River. CWPCo is a regulated public utility that provides electricity to our Wisconsin Rapids facility, and a small number of industrial, light commercial and residential customers.
We utilize a continuous improvement process to lower our cost position and enhance operating efficiency through reduced consumption of energy and material inputs, reduced spending on indirect costs and improved productivity, product quality and safety. The program utilizes benchmarking data to identify improvement initiatives and establish performance targets. Detailed action plans are used to monitor the execution of these initiatives and calculate the amount saved. We also use multi-variable analysis, lean manufacturing, center of excellence teams, source-of-loss initiatives and best practice sharing to constantly improve our manufacturing processes and products. Since 2001, the Quinnesec Mill has been recognized in the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Voluntary Protection Program as a Star facility. The Michigan Voluntary Protection Program Star award is the state’s highest recognition for workplace safety programs and performance. Each year we develop and implement new efforts to continue our safety improvement and share our successes through the mentoring aspects of this important program.
Raw Materials and Suppliers

Our key cost inputs in the papermaking process are wood fiber, wood pulp, chemicals and energy.

Wood Fiber. We source our wood fiber from a broad group of timberland and sawmill owners located in the regions around our mills. Our cost to purchase wood is affected directly by the market price of wood in our regional markets and indirectly by the variability of fuel cost for the logging and transportation of timber to our facilities. While we have fiber supply agreements in place that ensure delivery of a substantial portion of our wood requirements, purchases under these agreements are typically at market rates. 

Wood Pulp. We source bleached wood pulp from market producers to supplement fiber requirements at our mills. The primary pulp procured is Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft, or “NBSK.” NBSK pulp is produced using a chemical process, whereby softwood chips are combined with chemicals and steam to separate the wood fibers. The fibers are washed and screened to remove the chemicals and lignin. Then the pulp is bleached to the necessary brightness. NBSK pulp provides a brighter fiber and the long fiber length from softwood pulp is beneficial for paper strength. We expect imbalances in supply and demand to create volatility in prices for market NBSK from time to time.
Chemicals. Chemicals utilized in the manufacturing of coated paper include latex, clay, starch, calcium carbonate, caustic soda, sodium chlorate and titanium dioxide. We purchase these chemicals from a variety of suppliers and are not dependent on any single supplier to satisfy our chemical needs. We expect imbalances in supply and demand to periodically create volatility in prices for certain chemicals.
Energy. We produce a significant portion of our energy needs for our paper mills from sources such as waste wood, waste heat recovery, liquid biomass from our pulping process and internal energy cogeneration facilities. Our external energy purchases include fuel oil, natural gas, coal and electricity. Our overall energy expenditures are mitigated by our internal energy production capacity and ability to switch between certain energy sources. The use of derivative contracts is also considered as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We reach our end-users through several channels, including merchants, brokers, printers, converters and direct sales to end-users. We sell our products to approximately 200 customers which comprise approximately 1,100 end-user accounts. 
Sales to End-Users. In 2020, we sold 35% of our paper products directly to end-users, most of which are specialty converters and catalog and magazine publishers. These customers are typically large, sophisticated buyers who have the scale, resources and expertise to procure paper directly from manufacturers. Customers for our NBHK pulp products are mostly other paper manufacturers.

Sales to Brokers and Merchants. Our largest indirect paper sales by volume are through brokers and merchants who resell the paper to end-users. In 2020, our sales to brokers and merchants represented 47% of our net sales. Brokers typically act as an intermediary between paper manufacturers and smaller end-users who do not have the scale or resources to cost effectively procure paper directly from manufacturers. The majority of the paper sold to brokers is resold to catalog publishers. We work closely with brokers to achieve market share in the catalog, magazine and insert end-user markets through collaborative selling.

Merchants are similar to brokers in that they act as an intermediary between the manufacturer and the end-user. However, merchants generally take physical delivery of the product and keep inventory on hand. Merchants tend to deal with smaller end-users that lack the scale to warrant direct delivery from the manufacturer. Coated freesheet comprises the majority of our sales to merchants. In most cases, because they are relatively small, the ultimate end-users of paper sold through merchants are generally regional or local commercial printers.
Sales to Printers. In 2020, our sales to printers represented 18% of our net sales. The majority of these sales were to the two largest publication printers in the United States. Printers also effectively act as an intermediary between manufacturers and end-users in that they directly source paper for printing/converting and then resell it to their customers as a finished product.

The majority of our paper products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facilities to the printer or converter, regardless of the sales channel. In addition, we maintain a network of distribution centers located in the West, Midwest, South and Northeast close to our customer base to provide quick delivery. The majority of our NBHK pulp is delivered to our customers’ paper mills.

Our sales force is organized around our sales channels. We maintain an active dialogue with all of our major customers and track product performance and demand across grades. We have a team of sales representatives and marketing professionals organized into three major sales groups that correspond with our sales channels: direct sales support; support to brokers and merchants; and printer support.

Many of our customers provide us with forecasts, which allow us to plan our production runs in advance, optimizing production over our integrated mill system and thereby reducing costs and increasing overall efficiency. Generally, our sales agreements do not extend beyond the calendar year and provide for quarterly or semiannual price adjustments based on market price movements.
Customers

We have developed long-standing relationships with many premier customers. Our relationships with our ten largest customers average more than 20 years. Our two largest customers, Central National-Gottesman and Veritiv Corporation, together accounted for 33% of our net sales in 2020. In 2020, our ten largest customers (including Central National-Gottesman and Veritiv Corporation) together accounted for 64% of our net sales. Our key customers in the graphic paper market include Central National-Gottesman, Quad/Graphics, Inc., Meredith/Time, Veritiv Corporation and Midland Paper. Our key customers in the specialty paper market include Avery Dennison, UPM Raflatac and Mactac.
Seasonality

We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly net sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors. These seasonal factors are common in the coated paper industry. Our third and fourth quarters are generally our strongest quarters for volume and revenue, reflecting an increase in printing related to end-of-year magazines, increased end-of-year direct mailings, and holiday season catalogs. Our working capital and accounts receivable generally peak in the third quarter, while inventory generally peaks in the second quarter in anticipation of the third quarter season. We expect our seasonality trends to continue for the foreseeable future.
Research and Development

The primary function of our research and development efforts is to work with customers in developing and modifying products to accommodate their evolving needs and to identify cost-saving opportunities within our operations. Over the past several years, examples of our research and development efforts include innovative and performance-driven products for the graphic and specialty printing markets.
Intellectual Property

We have several patents and patent applications in the United States and various foreign countries. These patents and patent applications generally relate to various paper manufacturing methods and equipment which may become commercially viable in the future. We also have trademarks for our name, Verso®, as well as for our products such as Sterling®, Futura®, Anthem Plus®, Productolith®, Influence®, Liberty® and Voyager®. In addition to the intellectual property that we own, we license a significant portion of the intellectual property used in our business on a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive basis from International Paper.
Competition
Our business is highly competitive. A significant number of North American competitors produce coated paper, specialty paper, packaging paper and NBHK pulp, and several overseas manufacturers export to North America. We compete based on a number of factors, including price, product availability, product quality, customer service, breadth of product offerings, timeliness of product delivery, market presence and degree of forward integration.
Foreign competition in North America is affected by the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies’ market prices in North America and other markets, worldwide supply and demand and the cost of ocean-going freight.

While our product offering is broad in terms of grades produced (from coated and uncoated graphical grades, including web and sheeted products, to highly technical specialty grades), our largest offering is in the coated freesheet category, with about two-thirds in web form and one-third in sheets. This strategy is driven primarily by our alignment with the commercial print market with a secondary focus on catalogs and magazines for our coated freesheet grades.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,700 active employees, of whom 52% are represented by 11 local branches of 6 different unions. We believe that we offer competitive compensation (including salary and incentive compensation) and benefits packages for all of our employees. We know that our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We believe that internal promotion and key employee retention are critical components to our long-term success. From professional development opportunities to leadership training, we have development programs and online opportunities to cultivate talent throughout the Company. 
We believe that an equitable and inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results in better, more innovative products and services and is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. We are committed to compliance with all applicable federal, state and local employment laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, citizenship, national origin, disability, military or veteran status and any other protected classifications.
Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations

We are subject to a wide range of federal, state, regional and local general and industry-specific environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including without limitation the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or “Clean Water Act,” the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or “CERCLA,” the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Emergency Planning & Community Right-To-Know Act, the Oil Pollution Act and similar state and local laws. In the future, we may be subject to additional federal, state, regional, local or supranational legislation related to climate change and greenhouse gas controls.
Among our activities subject to environmental regulation are the emissions of air pollutants, discharges of wastewater and stormwater, operation of dams, storage, handling, treatment and disposal of materials and waste, and remediation of soil, surface water and ground water contamination. Many environmental and health and safety laws and regulations provide for substantial fines or penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions for any failure to comply. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant costs for abatement measures, the interruption of our operations and/or facility shutdowns.
Certain environmental laws, such as CERCLA and similar state laws, provide for strict liability, and under certain circumstances joint and several liability, for investigation and remediation of the release of hazardous substances into the environment, including without limitation soil and groundwater. These laws may apply to properties presently or formerly owned or operated by or presently or formerly under the charge, management or control of an entity or its predecessors, as well as to conditions at properties at which waste attributable to an entity or its predecessors was disposed. Under environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property or a party formerly or previously in charge, management or control of real property and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of at real property, may be held liable for the cost to investigate or clean up that real property and for related damages to natural resources. We handle and dispose of wastes arising from our mill operations, including disposal at on-site landfills. We are required to maintain financial assurance (in the form of letters of credit and other similar instruments) for the expected cost of landfill closure and post-closure care. We could be subject to liability, including liability for investigation and cleanup costs, if contamination is discovered at one of our current or former paper mills or another location where we have disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, wastes. 
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We have made, and will continue to make, significant expenditures to comply with these requirements and our permits. We incurred environmental capital expenditures of $2 million, $3 million and $1 million in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Permits are required for the operation of our mills and related facilities. Most such permits are subject to periodic renewal, and all are subject to modification and revocation. We and others have the right to challenge our permit conditions through administrative and legal appeals and review processes. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with the permits, and violators are subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, injunctions or both. Other parties also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance with the permits.
We could be subject to potentially significant fines, penalties, criminal sanctions, mill shutdowns, or interruptions in operations for failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits.
In November 2019, the state of West Virginia asserted in an administrative enforcement action that three above-ground storage tanks at Verso’s Luke Mill leaked and that Verso had failed to take certain actions to prevent and report the release of pollutants into the North Branch of the Potomac River. In March 2020, the Potomac Riverkeeper Network (“PRKN”) filed a federal lawsuit against Verso alleging the improper handling, storage, and disposal of wastes generated at the Luke Mill. In May 2020, Maryland joined the PRKN lawsuit and in July 2020, Maryland obtained dismissal of a lawsuit that it previously had filed with respect to the same facts. The Luke Mill sits on the border of West Virginia and Maryland, and it was closed in June 2019.
We have worked cooperatively with the states of Maryland and West Virginia to address impacts to the environment at our Luke Mill from previous historic operations related to the alleged violations of state and federal environmental laws. We have undertaken actions to identify the extent of such impacts and have installed, and are continuing ongoing evaluation and installation of, remedial measures to address these impacts.
We are currently engaged in settlement negotiations with the states of Maryland and West Virginia and with the PKRN. We believe that we are nearing agreements in principle with the two states and the PKRN to settle all claims related to these environmental impacts including the installation of remedial measures and the payment of civil penalties to the two states.
If settlement terms with the state of West Virginia are reached, we anticipate that the state of West Virginia would file an action in West Virginia state court and would have a consent decree entered to effect the settlement.
As a result of our ongoing discussions with the states of Maryland and West Virginia and the PRKN, we have reserved an estimated amount for the potential settlements of these disputes in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
History
We began operations on August 1, 2006, when we acquired the assets and certain liabilities comprising the business of the Coated and Supercalendered Papers Division of International Paper. We were formed for the purpose of consummating the acquisition from International Paper. We completed our initial public offering of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in May 2008.
On January 26, 2016, Verso and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, or the “Debtors,” filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. On June 23, 2016, the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the Debtors’ First Modified Third Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code dated as of June 20, 2016, or the “Plan.” On July 15, 2016, the Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and the Debtors emerged from their Chapter 11 cases, or the “Chapter 11 Cases.”
