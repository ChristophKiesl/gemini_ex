DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Our Corporate History and Background

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 25, 2012, under the name Resort Savers, Inc. On May 28, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State, changing our name to Phoenix Rising Companies. The name change was effected with the OTC Markets Group, Inc. on March 10, 2021.
Change of Management

On February 9, 2018, concurrently with the execution of the Admall Exchange Agreement and the Dusun Termination Agreement, Zhou Gui Bin resigned from his positions as President, CEO, Secretary and Director of the Company, and Zhou Wei resigned from his positions as Treasurer, CFO and Director of the Company. The departing Directors approved, by written consent in lieu of special meeting of the Board of Directors, the appointment of Mr. Ding-Shin “DS” Chang and Mr. Boon Jin “Patrick” Tan as the new Directors of the Company and submitted such appointment for approval and ratification by the Company’s stockholders. The Company’s departing Directors also appointed Mr. Ding-Shin “DS” Chang as the Company’s President and CEO, Mr. Boon Jin “Patrick” Tan as the Company’s Treasurer and CFO, and Mr. Liang-Yu “Jacky” Chang as the Company’s Secretary, all of whom are to serve on an at-will basis until their resignation or removal by the Board of Directors.
Change in Fiscal Year End; Change to Bylaws; Reverse Stock Split; Corporate Name Change

On July 3, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a change in our fiscal year end from January 31 to December 31. The Company now operates on a fiscal year ending on December 31. The Company changed its bylaws to reflect the change in fiscal year end.

Contemporaneously with the change in fiscal year end, our Board of Directors approved a reverse one-for-thirty (1-for-30) stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Stock and a change of corporate name from “Resort Savers, Inc.” to “SCGI Group Holding, Inc.” (the “Name Change”). Following these corporate approvals, the management of the Company delayed implementation of the reserve stock split and corporate name change, and management never submitted an Issuer Company-Related Action Notification Form (“Notification Form”) with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) to effect such actions.

On July 15, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a reverse one-for-one hundred (1-for-100) stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Stock. The Reverse Split will have no effect on the number of authorized Common Stock of the Company, nor will it affect the authorized or issued and outstanding shares of its Preferred Stock, since the Company has no shares of Preferred Stock issued or outstanding. The Reverse Split will be effective following a review by FINRA, which the Company anticipates will be approximately thirty to sixty days following submission of a Notification Form with FINRA, which occurred on July 23, 2019. Upon effectiveness of the Reverse Split, the Company intends to file a Certificate of Change with the Nevada Secretary of State, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statute (“NRS”) 78.209. The Reverse Split was approved by the Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company on July 15, 2019. The record date for the Reverse Split is July 30, 2019. For more information on the Reverse Split, please refer to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on July 22, 2019.

On July 15, 2019, the Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company, each by executing a written consent, approved of an amended and restated articles of incorporation (the “Restated Articles”), which contain the Name Change. The officers of the Company intended to filed the Restated Articles with the Nevada Secretary of State following review of the Notification Form by FINRA. For more information on the Name Change, please refer to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which was filed with the SEC on July 22, 2019.

On August 14, 2019, the Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company, each by executing a written consent, voted to abandon the Name Change and Restated Articles. However, the Company proceeded with and implemented the Reverse Split. The Company submitted an amended notification to FINRA for abandonment of the Name Change and Restated Articles, and received approval from FINRA for the reverse split. The Reverse Split was effective on September 16, 2019.

(“Xing Rui”), acquired 20,068,750 shares of common stock (representing 20% of the issued and outstanding common stock) of Worx America, Inc. (“Worx”), a private company based in Houston, Texas, in exchange for $1,650,000 cash and 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Borneo Resource Investments Ltd. (“BRNE”) with a value of $350,000.

The Company accounted for this investment using the equity method, with an initial cost of $2,000,000.

Worx designed automated solutions for industrial, environmental and energy industries to improve efficiency and systems output. The Worx automated robotic tank cleaning system was intended to reduce tank cleaning time, reduce or eliminate the need for personnel to enter tanks, and may reduce the volume of solvents used to clean a tank.

On June 6, 2016, Worx sold all of its assets (“Asset Sale”), including, but not limited to, its technologies and intellectual property, to Bay WorxRail, LLC (“Bay WorxRail”) for $1,000,000 (“Purchase Price”), subject to a holdback of $250,000 of the Purchase Price, pursuant to the terms set forth in that certain Asset Purchase Agreement, dated June 6, 2016, among Worx, Bay WorxRail, and Michael Zilai, as majority stockholder of Worx.

Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd.

On October 1, 2015, the Company issued 3,033,926 shares of its Common Stock to Xu Xiao Yun in exchange for sixty percent (60%) of Shenzhen Amuli Industrial Development Co. Ltd., a PRC corporation (“Amuli”). The equity of Amuli that was transferred by Xu Xiao Yun was held by Huaxin Changrong (Shenzhen) Technology Service Co., Ltd. (“Huaxin”), which was formed by Xing Rui for the purpose of holding the equity of Amuli and other PRC subsidiaries. The purchase price was valued $2,400,000.

On November 19, 2018, the Company disposed of its partial ownership interest in Amuli by causing Huaxin and Amuli to enter into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Amuli Disposition Agreement”) with Ms. An Wenhui, a citizen of the PRC and minority shareholder of Amuli (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, Huaxin sold its sixty percent (60%) Amuli equity stake (the “Amuli Shares”) to the Purchaser (the “Amuli Disposition”). Pursuant to the Amuli Disposition Agreement, in exchange for the Amuli Shares, the Purchaser paid to Huaxin a cash price of $1 or the equivalent thereof in Chinese Yuan (the “Purchase Price”). Our Board of Directors approved the Amuli Disposition Agreement, the Amuli Disposition and the Purchase Price, because among other reasons the Board of Directors believed that Amuli would not produce significant future income or cash flow. The Amuli Disposition Agreement contains substantially fewer representations and warranties in comparison to other agreements entered into by the Company and its subsidiaries. Additionally, the closing of the Amuli Disposition occurred contemporaneously with the signing of the Amuli Disposition Agreement, which resulted in little or no covenants or closing conditions imposed on the parties. As a result, Amuli is no longer a partially-owned subsidiary of the Company.

Beijing Yandong Tieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd.

On January 29, 2016, the Company entered into an exchange agreement (the “Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement”) with Mr. Yang Baojin (“Mr. Yang”), a citizen of the PRC, and the Company’s subsidiary Huaxin. Mr. Yang was the president and majority owner of Beijing Yandong Tieshan Oil Products Co., Ltd. (“Tieshan Oil”). Pursuant to the Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement, the Company issued 4,800,000 shares of its Common Stock to Mr. Yang, who delivered to Huaxin an ownership interest in Tieshan Oil such that Huaxin at the time of closing owned 51% of all ownership interests in Tieshan Oil (the “Tieshan Oil Exchange”). The Company held 1,200,000 shares of its Common Stock in escrow (the “Escrow Shares”) to issue to Mr. Yang twelve months following the closing of the Tieshan Oil Exchange, in connection with the successful performance of certain covenants by Mr. Yang. The Company did not issue the Escrow Shares to Mr. Yang in connection with the Tieshan Oil Exchange.

On May 16, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Tieshan Oil by entering into a second share exchange agreement (the “Second Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement”) with Mr. Yang. Pursuant to the Second Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement, the Company, through Huaxin, agreed to acquire the remaining 49% of Tieshan Oil held by Mr. Yang, in exchange for the issuance to Mr. Yang of 16,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Tieshan Oil Acquisition”). The Tieshan Oil Acquisition closed simultaneously with the execution of the Second Tieshan Oil Exchange Agreement.

Apart from the Tieshan Oil Acquisition, neither the Company nor Huaxin has a material relationship with either Mr. Yang or Tieshan Oil.

Bhd., a limited liability company registered under the laws of Malaysia (“Dusun Eco”), and the shareholders of Dusun Eco (the “Dusun Sellers”), by which the Company agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding stock of Dusun Eco in exchange for the issuance of 400,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. After further review of the due diligence materials related to the Exchange, our Board of Directors felt that it was in the Company’s best interest to terminate the Dusun Exchange Agreement. On February 9, 2018, the Company, Dusun Eco and the Dusun Sellers entered into a Termination of Share Exchange Agreement (the “Dusun Termination Agreement”), by which the Company, Dusun Eco and the Dusun Sellers agreed to terminate the Dusun Exchange Agreement with no legal consequence to any of the parties to the Dusun Exchange Agreement.

Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Our Position in the Industry

In addition to the operating entities and businesses described above, we are actively involved in the acquisition of businesses which we believe will generate cash within an acceptable time horizon, and we primarily use our capital stock as consideration in such acquisitions. We face many competitors in the strategic investment and acquisition sector, including private equity funds, sovereign wealth and pension funds, corporate conglomerates, single family offices and multi-family offices, asset management firms, corporate acquirors which are strategically positioned in industries competitive with ours, and other small-cap public companies which primarily use equity securities to finance investments and acquisitions. In the latter category, barriers to entry are extremely low, and we face intense competition to source investment targets and to close investments. Our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do, including sufficient cash to pay consideration for acquisitions. There are no assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be successful or that we will continue to be able to compete with other funds, companies or other sources of capital to secure competitive acquisition targets and consummate future transactions.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchise Restrictions and Contractual Obligations & Concessions

We rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product designs and marks.

We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the construction and operation of any facility in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities.

Research and Development Activities and Costs

We have not incurred any research and development costs for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020.

Employees

Including our subsidiaries, we have 20 full-time employees and we do not anticipate hiring more employees in the near future.
