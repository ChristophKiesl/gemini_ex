Item 1. Business
Our company
We are a global property and casualty, or P&C, insurance and reinsurance company with approximately $1.1 billion in capital as of December 31, 2019 and with operations in Bermuda, the United States and Europe. Our strategy combines a diversified, casualty-focused underwriting portfolio, accessed through our multi-year, renewable strategic underwriting management relationship with Arch, with a disciplined investment strategy comprising primarily non-investment grade corporate credit assets, managed by HPS Investment Partners, LLC, or HPS. We have designed our investment strategy to complement the characteristics of our target underwriting portfolio in order to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. Our strategy involves a greater degree of investment risk balanced with a less volatile underwriting portfolio, especially in relation to the amount of catastrophe exposure we assume, as compared with traditional insurers and reinsurers. 
We were formed in Bermuda in the second quarter of 2013. In March 2014, we raised $1.1 billion in our initial funding and began underwriting reinsurance in the first half of 2014. Our operating subsidiaries all carry a financial strength rating of “A-” (Excellent) with a stable outlook from A.M. Best Company, or A.M. Best, which is the fourth highest of 15 ratings that A.M. Best confers. Each of our operating subsidiaries also carries a financial strength rating of “A” with a stable outlook from Kroll Bond Rating Agency, or KBRA, which is the sixth highest of 22 ratings that KBRA confers. These ratings are each intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer’s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not ratings of our common shares.
We manage our insurance and reinsurance underwriting through our relationship with Arch, which, through Arch Reinsurance Ltd., or ARL, is one of our founding equity investors. ARL, which is a subsidiary of Arch Capital Group Ltd., or ACGL, a leading global insurance and reinsurance company whose shares are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ACGL,” invested $100 million in our common shares. ACGL had approximately $13.2 billion in capital and a market capitalization of approximately $17.4 billion as of December 31, 2019 and provides a full range of property, casualty and mortgage insurance and reinsurance lines, with a particular focus on writing specialty lines on a worldwide basis through operations in Bermuda, the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and South Africa. 
Our strategic relationship with Arch provides us with unique underwriting expertise and market access based upon our ability to leverage Arch’s global underwriting infrastructure and distribution platform and has enabled us to build a diversified global portfolio of insurance and reinsurance risks. Our operating subsidiaries have written an aggregate of approximately $3.4 billion in gross premiums written from inception to December 31, 2019.
Our main operating subsidiary is Watford Re Ltd., or Watford Re, a Bermuda-based company that began writing business in early 2014 and is registered as a Class 4 insurer with the Bermuda Monetary Authority, or the BMA. Bermuda is one of the largest insurance and reinsurance centers in the world, particularly for P&C markets, providing insurance and reinsurance capacity for risks on a global basis. In addition to traditional P&C lines, Watford Re also writes mortgage insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis. Our Bermuda presence gives us direct and efficient access to reinsure these risks. In mid-2015, we formed and capitalized Watford Insurance Company Europe Limited, or WICE, in Gibraltar to conduct business in Europe. In December 2015, WICE began writing business with access to markets across the European Union, targeting both personal lines and commercial lines of P&C insurance, which it distributes through coinsurance relationships and specialized insurance agents (also known as program managers). In addition, in December 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire Axeria IARD, a P&C insurance company based in France. The 
5

completion of this acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.
In late 2015, we formed and capitalized Watford Specialty Insurance Company, or WSIC, a U.S.-based excess & surplus, or E&S, lines insurer. In April 2016, WSIC began writing insurance business in the U.S. E&S market, concentrating its efforts on commercial lines of property and casualty coverage, which it distributes through program managers. We further expanded our U.S. capabilities in August 2016 through the acquisition and capitalization of Watford Insurance Company, or WIC, which has enabled us to access the larger admitted (or licensed) U.S. insurance market, also through program managers. Between WSIC and WIC, we are able to access the entire U.S. P&C insurance market, offering either admitted insurance products or E&S insurance products to service market demand.
The majority of our investments are allocated to non-investment grade corporate credit assets managed by HPS, which we refer to as our non-investment grade portfolio. 
HPS is a global investment platform with a focus on non-investment grade credit. HPS had approximately $61 billion of assets under management as of December 31, 2019. HPS manages our non-investment grade portfolio pursuant to investment guidelines formulated to complement our underwriting portfolio. The primary objective of our non-investment grade investment strategy is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns comprising current interest income, trading gains and capital appreciation, with an emphasis on capital preservation. As of December 31, 2019, non-investment grade corporate credit assets comprised approximately 69% of our overall investment portfolio.
We refer to the remainder of our invested assets as our investment grade portfolio, which is primarily managed by Arch Investment Management Ltd., or AIM, a subsidiary of Arch that manages the investments of Arch’s own funds. We also have several investment grade accounts managed by other Investment Managers, including HPS.
Since formation, we have meaningfully grown our business, generating sizable underwriting revenue and significant interest income. We believe that we are well-positioned to continue delivering prudent growth by balancing our complementary underwriting and investment strategies. From inception through December 31, 2019, our net premiums written and net interest income were as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31, | | ITD 
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017 | 
 | ($ in thousands) 
Net premiums written | $ | 532,862 | | | $ | 604,175 | | $ | 553,117 | $ | 2,944,357
Net interest income | 116,211 | | | 107,533 | | | 86,523 | | 491,192

On March 28, 2019, we completed a direct listing of our common shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. On June 28, 2019, we also completed a direct listing of our 8½% Cumulative Redeemable Preference Shares, or our preference shares, on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. 
Further, in 2019, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program, which allowed us to make repurchases of up to $75 million of our common shares from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. From the inception of the share repurchase program in September 2019 through December 31, 2019, we repurchased 2.8 million common shares for a purchase price of $75 million, excluding transaction costs, fully utilizing the program. In the first quarter of 2020, our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $50 million of our outstanding common shares from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions.

Strategy
Execute a dynamic business model focused on total returns
We are a total return-driven insurance and reinsurance company. We strive to deliver attractive long-term returns to our shareholders by writing a diversified underwriting portfolio through a proven, disciplined approach, augmented by an investment strategy comprising primarily non-investment grade fixed income corporate credit assets and designed to complement our target underwriting business mix. We feel that this combination enhances our opportunity to thoughtfully deploy our capital in the most effective manner and to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns across both sides of the balance sheet, thereby maximizing the total return for our shareholders.
Build an insurance platform that supplements our reinsurance business
In 2015, we expanded our platform to include P&C insurance business in the United States and European markets. The business we access at the insurance level generally has lower acquisition costs than similar business accessed at the reinsurance level, and provides other operating efficiencies. In addition, we expect that our insurance business will produce further diversification benefits resulting in lower volatility of our underwriting results. 
The table below shows the net insurance premiums written generated by our insurance business for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. We intend to continue to grow our insurance business opportunistically by leveraging our strategic relationship with Arch.

Capitalize on the expertise and infrastructure of Arch, our exclusive underwriting manager
We have partnered with Arch to source and manage our underwriting portfolio in accordance with our underwriting guidelines. We believe this relationship will enable us to execute our chosen, casualty-focused underwriting strategy based on Arch’s expertise in our target lines of business. This arrangement provides us with access to Arch’s global underwriting infrastructure and distribution platform, and has allowed us to quickly build a global portfolio of diversified insurance and reinsurance risks.
Pursue an investment approach that complements our underwriting strategy
Our investment strategy seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns comprising interest income, trading gains and capital appreciation with an emphasis on capital preservation. This investment strategy complements our underwriting portfolio, which predominantly targets medium- to long-tail casualty business. Our non-investment grade portfolio, which is managed by HPS, consists of high yielding corporate credit assets. Our goal in pursuing this strategy is to generate superior investment returns, as compared with investment returns achieved by our peers, through disciplined and prudent credit risk analysis and proper pricing for the risk assumed. We seek to achieve risk-adjusted returns that exceed those of typical reinsurer investment portfolios while also producing stable cash flows from scheduled interest payments. Our lower volatility, casualty-focused underwriting portfolio should have predictability in terms of the timing of payments to insurance claimants, thereby mitigating the risk of having to sell assets during times of temporary investment market stresses.
7

Maintain a robust risk management program
We have a strong risk management function, overseen by our Chief Risk Officer. We benefit from our ability to leverage the risk management infrastructures in place within each of Arch and HPS. We regularly receive relevant exposure and modeling information from Arch and HPS. On that data we overlay our proprietary analytics, tailored risk appetites and controls for an integrated approach to monitoring and reviewing our exposures. We maintain active oversight of our underwriting and investment management service providers at both the management and board level.
Conservative approach to underwriting risk
We have designed our underwriting and investment strategies toward the goal of maintaining our balance sheet strength on a long-term basis through varying phases of market cycles. We target a medium-to long-term, lower volatility underwriting portfolio with tightly managed natural catastrophe exposure. We seek to limit our modeled net probable maximum loss, or PML, for property catastrophe exposures for each peak peril and peak zone from a 1-in-250 year occurrence to no more than 10% of the value of our total shareholders’ equity plus our senior notes and our preference shares, or our total capital, which is less than most of our principal reinsurance competitors. As of January 1, 2020, this modeled net PML was 4.2% of our total capital. Our conscious effort to limit our catastrophe exposure lowers the volatility of our overall underwriting portfolio and provides greater certainty as to future claims-related payout patterns and timing. Our casualty-focused underwriting portfolio’s payout pattern is slower than that of most of our competitors due to the longer tail lines of business we write, and that slower payout pattern provides us with the potential for greater investment income on those premiums, thereby providing us an underwriting modeling advantage when competing for those target lines of business.
We have a robust process for setting loss reserves, leveraging the established processes and procedures employed by Arch, making our own analyses and judgments, and through periodic reviews by external actuarial firms. We also regularly monitor our investment portfolios, including performance of the underlying credits, overall liquidity and how well that liquidity matches with the projected claims payments related to our underwriting portfolio. Being prudent stewards of our balance sheet allows us to maintain the confidence of all of our constituents and thereby to position ourselves to better achieve our goals.
Our operations
Underwriting operations: insurance and reinsurance
Through our underwriting operations we are able to offer a variety of P&C insurance and reinsurance products on a global basis. We target an underwriting portfolio that is diversified by line of business and geography, with a focus on medium- to long-tail casualty business. Given the inception of our insurance operations, our underwriting portfolio to-date has been predominantly reinsurance, although we expect our insurance writings to increase going forward. We have built a diversified, low volatility portfolio by purposely limiting our modeled natural catastrophe exposure to a level lower than many other insurers and reinsurers. Our strategy is to operate in lines of business in which underwriting skill and specialized knowledge can make a meaningful difference in operating results.
We have been well-received in the market and successful in writing what we believe to be attractive underwriting opportunities. We benefit from Arch’s broad underwriting expertise and worldwide distribution network. Arch’s global, multi-line market presence facilitates the ability for Arch to strategically adapt our mix of business by geography, product line or type, as we or Arch perceive potential opportunities. In addition, as a result of our operating subsidiaries’ “A-” (Excellent) rating from A.M. Best and “A” rating from KBRA, as well as our strong balance sheet, we are well-positioned to increase our premium volume in favorable market cycles, creating additional attractive underwriting opportunities.
8

Similar to other reinsurers and to other insurers writing business through program managers, we do not separately evaluate each individual risk assumed and are, therefore, largely dependent upon the original underwriting decisions made by the ceding companies and program managers in accordance with agreed underwriting guidelines. However, we believe Arch’s experience in portfolio risk selection and detailed monitoring of cedants and program managers provides us with a competitive advantage.
Our Bermuda-based operating subsidiary, Watford Re, writes a broad range of P&C coverages. In addition to traditional P&C lines, Watford Re also writes mortgage insurance and reinsurance on a worldwide basis. Our reinsurance business leverages Arch’s global underwriting platform to distribute a wide variety of products covering lines of business around the world. We write business for third-party cedants and also assume a meaningful portion of our business as a reinsurance or retrocession of business that Arch has underwritten for its own portfolio and that also meets our underwriting guidelines and return metrics. The table below provides the percentage of our total gross premiums written assumed from Arch for years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. 

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
Gross premiums written - assumed from Arch | 26.6 | % | | 34.4 | % | 48.2 | %

Arch competes with us and will continue to underwrite business for its own distinct portfolios in accordance with its own policies, strategies and business plans. In sourcing insurance and reinsurance opportunities through its worldwide platform, Arch evaluates the perceived risk exposure pursuant to its proprietary underwriting methodology, and then models the required pricing based on both its and our underwriting criteria. In furtherance of our underwriting philosophy to pursue lines of business in which underwriting knowledge and expertise can drive attractive returns, our underwriting guidelines are based largely on Arch’s own, leveraging the experience of Arch’s underwriting professionals. Our underwriting guidelines differ from Arch’s in several aspects, most notably in that our guidelines purposely limit catastrophe risk and our portfolio focus is on mid- to long-tail casualty and other lines of business with similar tenor, whereas Arch’s target business mix includes more catastrophe exposure and a higher percentage of shorter-tail lines.
In underwriting business on our behalf, Arch fundamentally employs the same qualitative and quantitative evaluation and selection criteria for our underwriting portfolio as it does for its own account and each potential contract is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively for both Arch’s portfolio and ours. For each opportunity that passes Arch’s qualitative and quantitative screening, when performing the pricing evaluation of a contract on our behalf, Arch applies our investment return assumptions to determine our expected return on the allocated capital for each such business opportunity.  The determination by Arch as to whether to offer only Arch capacity, only our capacity, or both as side-by-side capacity, depends on the result of the pricing analysis using differing investment assumptions for us and Arch, reflecting our differentiated investment strategies. The mid- to long-tail business on which we focus can benefit from a higher return on the premium float and thus, certain opportunities that meet our metrics may not meet those of insurers and reinsurers like Arch with a more traditional investment strategy. In underwriting operations, “float” arises when premiums are received before losses and other expenses are paid and is an interval that sometimes extends over many years. During that time, the insurer invests the premiums, earns interest income and may generate capital gains and losses. In order to provide solutions to its reinsurance brokers and potential insurance clients, Arch has a strategic incentive to place that business with us rather than simply declining to provide capacity to the broker or potential client in such circumstances. 
Other than renewals of business previously written by our underwriting subsidiaries, Arch is not required to allocate any particular business opportunities to us. However, we believe that Arch has 
9

strong incentives to allocate attractive business to us, based on Arch’s investments in us, our contractual arrangements through which Arch earns premium-based fees and a profit commission for business written on our behalf, and Arch’s ability to offer potential clients additional solutions, thus gaining a strategic benefit in the competitive, syndicated reinsurance market in which it is often necessary to be on an expiring contract to have the opportunity to bid to provide capacity at the next annual renewal.
Through our relationship with Arch, we have built a diversified portfolio of medium- to long-tail commercial lines casualty, other specialty and property risks. Our underwriting segment captures the results of our underwriting lines of business, which are comprised of specialty products on a worldwide basis. Our four major lines of business are described as follows:

• | Casualty reinsurance: coverage provided to ceding company clients on third-party liability and workers’ compensation exposures, primarily on a treaty basis. Business written includes coverages such as: executive assurance, medical malpractice liability, other professional liability, workers’ compensation, excess and umbrella liability and excess auto liability.


• | Other specialty reinsurance: coverage provided to ceding company clients for personal and commercial auto (other than excess auto liability), mortgage, surety, accident and health, workers’ compensation catastrophe, agriculture and marine and aviation.


• | Property catastrophe reinsurance: protects ceding company clients for most catastrophic losses that are covered in the underlying policies. Perils covered may include hurricane, earthquake, flood, tornado, hail and fire, and coverage for other perils on a case-by-case basis. Property catastrophe reinsurance provides coverage on an excess of loss basis when aggregate losses and loss adjustment expense from a single occurrence of a covered peril exceed the retention specified in the contract.


• | Insurance programs and coinsurance: targeting program managers and/or coinsurers with unique expertise and niche products offering primary and excess general liability, umbrella liability, professional liability, workers’ compensation, personal and commercial automobile, inland marine and property business with minimal catastrophe exposure.

Our insurance operations are conducted in the United States and Europe. We established our insurance platform as a complement to our reinsurance strategy to expand our distribution channels. Our insurance strategy is focused on pursuing attractive underwriting opportunities in the U.S. and European insurance markets and we view our insurance platform as having the potential to provide meaningful premium growth.
In the United States, we are authorized to write commercial P&C lines of business in both the admitted market and the E&S market through our WIC and WSIC subsidiaries, respectively, with distribution through coinsurance relationships or through select program managers that develop and distribute specialized insurance products for these subsidiaries. In Europe, we write direct insurance and coinsurance business, primarily in personal P&C lines, through lead insurers and program managers that develop and distribute specialized insurance products for our WICE subsidiary.

We operate and monitor our lines of business through our underwriting operations. The table below provides a breakdown of our gross premiums written for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:

Reinsurance operations 
Watford Re is a licensed, Class 4 Bermuda-based reinsurer operating under the supervision of the BMA. Arch serves as our exclusive reinsurance portfolio manager and provides reinsurance-related services including exposure modeling, loss reserve recommendations, claims handling and other related services as part of our long-term services agreements with them. All reinsurance contracts are bound on our behalf by designated employees made available to us by Arch, or, in certain circumstances, by Watford Re management.
We assume reinsurance from third-party cedants or from Arch entities on a reinsurance or retrocessional basis. The retrocessions from Arch are from its reinsurance operations in the United States, Bermuda, Europe, and Australia, levering Arch’s distribution and local expertise in its markets. We also have provided, and may continue to provide, reinsurance to Arch’s insurance operations in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere.
Insurance operations
In 2015 and 2016, we established insurance operations in Europe and the United States. These insurance operations provide additional points of access to our target lines of business, with the potential added benefit for lower acquisition costs and other distribution efficiencies. All of our insurance subsidiaries carry our A.M. Best “A-” (Excellent) rating and our KBRA “A” rating and through them we pursue insurance product lines similar to those we target through our reinsurance operations.
In the United States, our principal insurance subsidiaries are WSIC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, WIC, both of which are domiciled in New Jersey. WSIC is an eligible E&S lines insurer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. WIC is an admitted insurer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Following our acquisition of WIC in 2016, we have expanded our certificates of authority to cover a broad range of lines of business in 46 states and the District of Columbia, and we are in the process of similarly expanding our authority in the remaining seven states. Both WSIC and WIC are located in New Jersey. Through WSIC and WIC we have the flexibility to access both the E&S and admitted sectors of the U.S. P&C market. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries concentrate primarily on commercial casualty lines of insurance and have initiated writing business through select program managers.
Our insurance operations in Europe are conducted through WICE, which has its principal office in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. WICE was formed to provide access to insurance risks across the European Union. WICE concentrates on U.K. and Western European risks, predominantly in personal lines of insurance but will also entertain commercial casualty lines.
11

Our goal within our insurance operations is to be a valued, long-term capacity partner with a select group of well-established, proven program managers, with our integrated total return strategy providing them with competitive solutions for their clients. We have a strong market position with approximately $1.1 billion in capital and an “A-” rating from A.M. Best for each of our operating subsidiaries. Many of the insurers providing capacity to program managers are neither as substantially capitalized nor as highly rated as we are; having a strong insurance partner gives program managers an edge when promoting products to clients.
We believe that our ability to enter insurance markets on a largely variable cost basis, unburdened by the fixed costs that would otherwise be required to create a standalone insurance operation, provides us with another significant and fundamental advantage. We benefit from AUI’s and AUL’s industry contacts and market acumen to identify, attract and retain those program managers that satisfy our guidelines in terms of reputation, technical track record and quality of administration. While we benefit from AUI’s and AUL’s infrastructure, our acquisition and administrative costs are largely based on premiums actually produced.
Subject to our overall underwriting guidelines, on our behalf, AUL, for WICE, or AUI, for WSIC and WIC, thoroughly conducts due diligence on each prospective program manager and approves underwriting guidelines for each specific line and class of business before delegation of the underwriting and/or claims-handling authority to any such program manager. We believe that by stringently vetting potential program managers we can advantageously and efficiently access a broad customer base while maintaining underwriting control and discipline. Fundamentally, AUL and AUI employ the same evaluation and selection criteria in scrutinizing our prospective program managers as they do for Arch’s own account. The determination by AUL and AUI as to whether to offer our policies, Arch’s policies, or both, depends on the result of the pricing analysis using the differing return assumptions of each company. On an ongoing basis, we and AUL or AUI, as applicable, monitor the business produced and financial condition of each program manager through periodic audits of underwriting, claims and operations.
Sourcing and underwriting
We have a strategic relationship pursuant to which Arch assists us in our pursuit of a highly disciplined underwriting approach, targeting lines of business that we believe will allow us to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns throughout industry market cycles. On our behalf, Arch continuously monitors the broad insurance and reinsurance market for opportunities. Specifically, Arch monitors opportunities that are anticipated to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns with a particular focus on product lines, which may have previously experienced adverse results and are therefore beginning to benefit from an increase in premium rates, and thus provide a potentially beneficial time to enter, or increase activity in, those markets. Similarly, on our behalf, Arch analyzes the market for softening product lines for which the applicable rates may provide less attractive risk-adjusted returns and potentially reduces our exposure to such lines accordingly at renewal.
Our strategy is to operate in lines of business in which underwriting expertise can make a meaningful difference in operating results. We are opportunistic in our pursuit of underwriting risks and binding business where we believe we have a competitive advantage in risk evaluation, distribution, investment strategy, or a combination of these factors. Our recent establishment of U.S. and European insurance operations enables us to directly access similar types of underlying risk premium as we underwrite as reinsurance, with what we believe to be better risk-adjusted pricing. Accessing premium through our insurance operations should also provide the benefit of lower acquisitions costs.
Our underwriting philosophy is based on prudent risk selection, risk diversification and comprehensive pricing analysis. We believe that the key to our approach is adherence to underwriting rigor across all types of business we underwrite. We employ a disciplined, analytical approach to underwriting. As part of the underwriting process, a variety of factors are typically assessed, including: (i) adequacy of underlying rates combined with the expected return on equity 
12

for a given insurance or reinsurance program; (ii) the industry reputation, track record, perceived financial strength and stability of the proposed client, or program manager in the case of our insurance business; (iii) the likelihood of establishing a long-term relationship with the client or program manager; (iv) the specialized knowledge and access to business that they possess; (v) the geographic area in which the client or program manager does business, together with our aggregate exposures in that area; (vi) historical loss data for the client or program manager; and (vii) projections of future loss frequency and severity.
Pursuant to our underwriting guidelines, we target an underwriting portfolio with tightly managed natural catastrophe exposure. We currently seek to limit our modeled PML for property catastrophe exposures for each peak peril and peak zone from a 1-in-250 year occurrence to no more than 10% of our total capital, which is less than most of our principal reinsurance competitors. Our conscious effort to limit our catastrophe exposure lowers the volatility of our overall underwriting portfolio and provides greater certainty as to future claims-related payout patterns and timing, dovetailing well with our non-investment grade investment strategy by minimizing the possibility of needing to sell investments at inopportune times in the investment market cycles.
We believe that our experienced senior management, combined with Arch’s underwriting expertise and broad market access, allows us to identify business with attractive risk-reward characteristics. As new underwriting opportunities are identified, we explore the suitability of underwriting the new business in order to take advantage of perceived market trends, particularly in lines of business for which Arch already possesses deep underwriting expertise.
Policy service and claims management
Arch provides underwriting services, portfolio management, exposure modeling, loss reserve recommendations, claims-handling, legal oversight, regulatory compliance, policy issuance and development, underwriting systems review, program manager audits, accounting support and administrative support, in each case, subject to the terms and conditions of our services agreements with Arch, including our underwriting and operational guidelines, as well as the oversight of our management and board of directors.
We believe that handling claims is an important component of customer service through which we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors. The ability to handle claims in accordance with industry best practices and standards fosters credibility in the market both with customers and with program managers. Through this arrangement with Arch, we gain access on a very cost-effective basis to highly experienced underwriting, claims and support function professionals and benefit from the exemplary customer service reputation Arch has earned over its 16-year history.
In administering claims on our behalf, Arch may engage third-party claims-handling firms to monitor, adjust and pay claims up to designated approval levels. Arch provides close supervision over any such third-party managers. Claims-handling firms are monitored and audited on an ongoing basis by Arch. When considering any proposed claims-handling delegation, Arch evaluates the candidate’s expertise, track record, staffing adequacy, reputation and licensing as required.
Reinsurance relationships
We have entered into outward quota share reinsurance agreements with Arch for each of our operating subsidiaries, which we believe provides a strong alignment of interest through Arch’s assuming a direct and meaningful sharing of the risk it underwrites for us. Subject to limited exceptions, Arch participates in a minimum 15% interest in all risks written by us, either by its own original participation, writing a companion line with us, or by accepting a minimum 15% quota share participation on all other contracts.
From time to time, we purchase third-party reinsurance when deemed advantageous from a portfolio management standpoint. We only use reinsurers carrying an “A-” or higher rating from 
13

A.M. Best or Standard & Poor’s or, alternatively, reinsurers that provide sufficient collateral to mitigate credit risk exposure.
Investment operations
Overview
Our invested assets are funded with our capital, accumulated net underwriting float, reinvested net interest income, net capital gains and borrowings to purchase investments. These invested assets are allocated between our non-investment grade portfolio and our investment grade portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, our non-investment grade portfolio represented approximately 69% of our invested assets and our investment grade portfolio represented approximately 31% of our invested assets. Our investment operations are monitored by our President and Chief Risk Officer and the investment committee of our board of directors.
Our non-investment grade portfolio is comprised principally of corporate credit assets managed by HPS pursuant to separate investment management agreements with Watford Re, Watford Asset Trust I, or Watford Trust, and each of our insurance subsidiaries. Each such investment management agreement with HPS includes investment guidelines. Subject to these guidelines, HPS makes all investment decisions with respect to our non-investment grade portfolio on our behalf. Our non-investment grade investment strategy and guidelines are formulated to complement our target underwriting portfolio, and are designed to meet the projected payout characteristics of the medium- to long-tail, lower-volatility underwriting portfolio we underwrite.
The remainder of our investment portfolio is invested in investment grade assets, the largest portion of which is managed by AIM. We also have several investment grade accounts managed by other Investment Managers, including HPS.
The following chart shows the breakdown of our total investments among our non-investment grade portfolio and our investment grade portfolio as of December 31, 2019:
Total: $2,709.1 million
14

The following chart shows the breakdown of our investments by rating within our total investment portfolio as of December 31, 2019: 
Total: $2,709.1 million
Investment grade ratings, such as “BBB” and above, indicate the applicable rating agency’s view that the investment has a low risk of credit default and that the obligor has at least adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation. 
Ratings below investment grade, such as “BB”, “B” and “CCC,” indicate the applicable rating agency’s view that the investment is speculative, that the obligor is more vulnerable than investment grade-rated obligors, and that, in the event of adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is less likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation. Based on published criteria, a “BB” rating reflects the applicable rating agency’s view that, while the obligation is less vulnerable to non-payment than other speculative issues, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. A rating of “B” reflects the applicable rating agency’s view that the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation, but adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. A rating of “CCC” indicates the applicable rating agency’s view that the obligation is currently vulnerable to non-payment and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. A rating below “CCC” indicates the applicable rating agency’s view that the obligation is currently highly vulnerable to non-payment.
The following is a representative list of the industries in which we may invest: Consumer Products, Food and Beverage, Healthcare, Pharmaceuticals, Tobacco, Technology, Automotive, Consumer Cyclical Services, Home Construction, Restaurants, Retailers, Insurance (Health, Life and Property and Casualty), Communications (Cable and Satellite, Media and Entertainment, Wireless and Wirelines), Banking and Other Financial Services, Capital Goods (Aerospace and Defense, Building Materials, Construction Machinery, Diversified Manufacturing), Energy, Other Industrial, and Transportation. However, we may invest in other industries if presented with attractive opportunities. 
As of December 31, 2019, the composition of our portfolio by industry, excluding asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities, was as follows: 12.2% of our portfolio was invested in 
15

Consumer Products, 8.3% in Technology, 6.2% in Consumer Cyclical Services and 5.7% in Insurance, with the remainder invested in other industries (with no other industry comprising greater than 5%). As of December 31, 2019, the geographic composition of our portfolio, excluding asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities, was as follows: 78.6% in United States, 10.9% in the United Kingdom, 2.4% in the Cayman Islands, and the remainder in other regions (with no other geographic region comprising greater than 2%).
A portion of our investment portfolio consists of assets that do not have a rating from one of the major rating agencies. Just as is done in connection with a potential investment in a rated debt obligation, when offered the opportunity to invest our assets into an unrated obligation, HPS thoroughly evaluates the obligor and the potential investment and makes a determination as to the inherent risks and whether the terms provide an attractive risk-adjusted return. A debt issuer may choose to forgo obtaining a rating for a number of reasons, particularly if the debt issuer is conducting a small privately placed transaction for which the ratings fees would be a burdensome expense or if the desired transaction date does not allow sufficient time for the completion of the rating process. It is also possible that a prospective issuer or the terms of the proposed obligation would not meet the rating agency requirements for the level of rating desired by the obligor company.

Non-investment grade portfolio
Background on HPS. HPS is a global investment firm with a focus on non-investment grade credit. Established in 2007, HPS has over 100 investment professionals and over 350 total employees. HPS manages capital for sophisticated investors, including financial institutions, public and corporate pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, funds of funds, endowments, foundations and family offices, as well as individuals. HPS is headquartered in New York with ten additional offices globally. HPS has approximately $61 billion of assets under management as of December 31, 2019.
HPS was originally formed as a unit of Highbridge, a subsidiary of JPMorgan Asset Management Holdings Inc. In March 2016, the principals of HPS acquired the firm from JPMorgan Asset Management Holdings Inc., which retained Highbridge’s hedge fund strategies.
Investment strategy. Our non-investment grade portfolio seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns comprising current interest income, trading gains and capital appreciation, with an emphasis on capital preservation. To execute the non-investment grade component of our investment strategy, we mandated HPS with a strategy that (i) is designed to meet the projected payout characteristics of the medium- to long-term, lower-volatility underwriting portfolio we underwrite and (ii) seeks to achieve risk-adjusted returns that exceed those of typical reinsurer investment portfolios by focusing on non-investment grade assets, with the flexibility to invest a limited portion of this portfolio in less liquid assets. Specifically, we seek to achieve investment 
16

returns that exceed those returns achieved by our competitors from their fixed-income portfolios. We believe this strategy provides us with risk-adjusted returns that are both attractive and appropriate given our underwriting portfolio.
HPS manages our non-investment grade corporate credit assets, including bank loans and high yield bonds, and may also invest in other instruments such as mezzanine debt, equities, credit default swaps, structured credit instruments and other derivative products. Our non-investment grade portfolio seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns comprising current interest income, trading gains and capital appreciation, with an emphasis on capital preservation. Pursuant to these investment guidelines, HPS is permitted to hedge the assets in our non-investment grade portfolio to reduce volatility and protect against systemic risks, as well as to enter into opportunistic short positions. Other than cash and cash equivalents, investment positions with a single issuer will comprise no more than 7.5% of the aggregate Long Market Value (defined as the value of the long investments of the portfolio of Watford Re or Watford Trust, valued using the methodologies set forth in Watford Re’s or Watford Trust’s investment management agreement with HPS, as applicable) of our non-investment grade portfolio. Positions established primarily for hedging purposes (including, without limitation, index positions) are not subject to this limit, and capital structure arbitrage positions in an issuer are deemed separate investments for the purposes of these limitations.
Through this strategy, we seek to achieve risk-adjusted returns that exceed those of typical reinsurer investment portfolios by focusing on non-investment grade assets, with the flexibility to invest a limited portion of this portfolio in less liquid assets. Limited positions in equity securities are also permitted, subject to our non-investment grade investment guidelines, which are an integral component of each applicable investment management agreement. Generally, any equity investments are not expected, in the aggregate, to represent more than 10% of the Long Market Value of our non-investment grade portfolio, and are expected to be focused on either a value-oriented approach or a catalyst to a realization event, which include restructurings, lawsuits and regulatory changes, among other examples. Equity investments resulting in ownership exceeding 18.5% of the outstanding equity securities of an issuer, measured at the time of investment, will require our prior approval. HPS may also utilize other investment instruments for our non-investment grade portfolio, subject to our non-investment grade investment guidelines. 
The non-investment grade investment guidelines under Watford Trust’s and our insurance subsidiaries’ respective investment management agreements with HPS also contain certain limitations relating to, among other things, the concentration of investments and utilization of leverage. As of December 31, 2019, HPS was in compliance with all non-investment grade investment guidelines. 
In order to implement our non-investment grade investment strategy, HPS may also, from time to time and upon consultation with us, invest a portion of our non-investment grade portfolio in investment funds managed by HPS. While there is no codified limit on the portion of our non-investment grade portfolio that may be invested in funds managed by HPS, we only expect to invest additional assets from our non-investment grade portfolio in funds managed by HPS to the extent that HPS, in consultation with us, determines that such investment would provide economic, tax, regulatory or other benefits to us (for instance, such as allowing us to access a strategy that we would not have been able to efficiently access other than through investment in such a fund). To the extent that any such assets are invested directly or indirectly in funds managed by HPS, such assets invested in funds managed by HPS are part of our non-investment grade portfolio. We pay HPS performance and management fees on the assets in our non-investment grade portfolio. Such fees are calculated on the non-investment grade portfolio as a whole such that the assets, if any, invested in HPS-managed funds were to increase in value in a given period but the non-investment grade portfolio as a whole were to decrease during such period, we would not owe HPS a performance fee for such period. Similarly, if the assets, if any, invested in HPS-managed funds were to decrease in value in a given period but the non-investment grade portfolio as a whole were to 
17

increase during such period, we would owe HPS a performance fee for such period. We do not pay HPS any separate or additional fees with respect to any such assets invested in HPS-managed funds. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the balance of such assets were $30.5 million and $49.8 million, respectively. 
When evaluating an insurer’s financial strength and determining minimum capital requirements, rating agencies and applicable regulators typically assign capital charges to not only the underwriting portfolio but also to the different classes of investment assets held by that insurer, based on the perceived level of risk and volatility. Our non-investment grade assets are viewed as riskier than investment grade assets and thereby carry higher capital charges than those assigned to investment grade assets, and therefore we may be required to hold more capital than similarly-sized traditional insurers and reinsurers, and it is possible that, for certain atypical, non-investment grade assets, we might receive minimal or no regulatory capital credit. While our strategy involves a greater degree of investment risk than is typical for traditional insurers and reinsurers, in our overall enterprise risk management framework, such increased investment risk is balanced with the more predictable timing of claims payments inherent in our underwriting portfolio, especially in relation to the lesser amount of catastrophe exposure we assume, as compared with the amount of such catastrophe risk assumed by many of our insurance and reinsurance peers. Our having a mid- to long-tail underwriting portfolio reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the risk of needing to sell investment assets into an inopportune market cycle in order to generate cash for claims payments.
In undertaking this strategy, based on the interest rate and/or credit spread environment as of any given quarter-end, we may periodically be required to absorb mark-to-market movements in our asset valuation on our financial statements. Our model is designed to create relatively stable and predictable cash flows from both underwriting and interest income to meet insurance liabilities, which should allow us to avoid being forced to sell assets at inopportune times.
The following chart shows the composition of our non-investment grade portfolio as of December 31, 2019:
Total: $1,862.3 million
Our investment guidelines permit HPS to utilize leverage in managing assets of Watford Re and Watford Trust (but not WICE, WSIC or WIC). Any such leverage, expressed as the excess of the value of the long investments of the portfolio of Watford Re or Watford Trust (valued using the methodologies set forth in Watford Re’s or Watford Trust’s investment management agreement with HPS, as applicable, and referred to as the Long Market Value), as applicable, over the net asset 
18

value of the portfolio as a percentage of the net asset value of the portfolio, is generally not to exceed 80%. Leverage may take a variety of forms, including borrowings to purchase additional assets, trading on margin total return swaps and other derivatives, and the use of inherently leveraged instruments. Depending upon the extent of the leverage utilized for our non-investment grade portfolio, the net value of our investment assets will increase or decrease at a greater rate than if leverage were not utilized.
The following chart shows the use of borrowings in our non-investment grade portfolio since 2014 and the Credit Suisse High Yield Index’s Spread-to-Worst since 2014. The spread-to-worst of the index is defined as the weighted average spread-to-worst of the bonds included in the index, where the spread-to-worst for each bond is the difference between the yield-to-worst for that bond and the yield of a U.S. Treasury security with a comparable maturity. The yield-to-worst for each bond is determined by computing the yield for that bond at all possible principal repayment dates, including the maturity date and each redemption date. The minimum of these calculated yields is the yield-to-worst, provided that, by definition, the yield must be above the yield of a U.S. Treasury security with a maturity date comparable to the bond’s yield-to-worst principal repayment date.
In the period since our inception, the credit-focused investment market experienced both a widening and then a tightening of credit spreads. As shown on the chart below, HPS, on our behalf, increased the deployment of assets into our credit-focused strategy through borrowings from our credit facility during the period in which credit spreads widened and then contracted the deployment of assets accordingly when credit spreads tightened. As demonstrated by the “Non-Investment Grade Portfolio Borrowing Ratio” chart below, our usage of borrowings to purchase additional assets in the non-investment grade portfolio increased as the Credit Suisse High Yield Index’s Spread-to-Worst widened, reflecting HPS’s view that these periods presented more attractive investment opportunities. When credit spreads later tightened, HPS, on our behalf, sold assets and we used the proceeds to repay borrowings from the credit facility. 
(1) The non-investment grade borrowing ratio is calculated as revolving credit agreement borrowings divided by net assets.
19

In the chart above, the term “Borrowing Ratio” represents borrowings to purchase investments divided by the market value of the non-investment grade portfolio net of these borrowings. From time to time, HPS takes short positions, and hedges or leverages the portfolio exposure through derivative instruments or otherwise. The chart above does not reflect the value of short positions or leverage inherent in derivative positions, and thus may not be fully reflective of the market exposure of the portfolio at any given time.
Our non-investment grade portfolio may purchase or short-sell securities without an offsetting position in a related security based on HPS’s determination that a particular security is undervalued or overvalued. Our non-investment grade portfolio may engage in interest rate hedging using swaps, treasuries, interest rate futures or other derivative instruments. Additionally, our non-investment grade portfolio may employ single name and index credit derivatives in an attempt to hedge credit exposure.
HPS combines a disciplined investment approach with a substantial platform for transaction sourcing. Through this platform, HPS’s investment professionals seek to identify and invest in a select number of investment opportunities. HPS is required to adhere to our non-investment grade portfolio’s investment guidelines and provides us with regular non-investment grade portfolio risk and performance updates, and provides a risk and performance review to our board of directors on a quarterly basis.
HPS’s investment process is driven by a rigorous investment screening and selection process, with the stated objective of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns comprising current interest income, trading gains and capital appreciation, with an emphasis on capital preservation. As part of HPS’s investment process, HPS manages our non-investment grade portfolio in accordance with the non-investment grade investment guidelines. HPS’s investment process emphasizes fundamental analysis and due diligence by seeking to evaluate potential investments based upon review and analysis of available public and private information including: (i) historical financial information; (ii) financial projections; (iii) business, sector and industry diligence; and (iv) legal analysis of the company and investment documentation. When possible, HPS seeks to achieve robust asset coverage in its investments.
Since our inception in 2014, starting with our initial $1.1 billion capital raise, HPS has methodically deployed the assets that we have allocated to our non-investment grade portfolio as market opportunities arose. As a result, until our non-investment grade allocation of our initial capital and underwriting float was fully deployed by HPS, our historical investment income was not reflective of a fully invested non-investment grade portfolio. The following chart depicts the deployment of the portion of our assets allocated to this non-investment grade investment strategy, including a breakout of the amount of borrowings related to purchases of non-investment grade investments in this portfolio and the commensurate increase in net interest income during the period of higher asset deployment into our credit-focused strategy. In the chart below and throughout this report, in connection with our non-investment grade portfolio, the term “net non-investment grade assets” are our total invested assets allocated to our non-investment grade investment strategy less borrowings to purchase such investments, and “net interest income” is interest income net of management fees paid to HPS and borrowing costs. 
20


The investments in our non-investment grade portfolio in 2014 were predominantly leveraged loans, based on HPS’s then-current view of the relative value of those assets versus bonds. Since that time, the proportion in bonds has grown to approximately one-half of the non-investment grade portfolio as of December 31, 2019, which is in line with our investment targets. The following chart shows the size and composition of our non-investment grade portfolio.

Investment grade portfolio
In conducting our underwriting business, we maintain a portion of our assets in investment grade securities and cash. The size of our investment grade portfolio and the amount we hold in cash will vary over time based on the business we write. We hold a certain amount of investment grade securities and short-term investments, largely to satisfy regulatory requirements for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries or to post as collateral for certain of Watford Re’s clients for commercial reasons or to obtain regulatory credit for the reinsurance they purchase. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 94.3% of our investment grade portfolio was held in our U.S. subsidiaries, 2.1% was posted as collateral and the remaining 3.6% were discretionary investments.
Our investment grade portfolio is primarily managed by AIM, with certain accounts managed by other Investment Managers, including HPS, and generally holds corporate credits assets, government bonds, and asset and mortgage-backed securities. Each of AIM, HPS and our other Investment Managers manage its respective allocation of our investment grade portfolio pursuant to investment management agreements that it has entered into with Watford Re and each of our operating subsidiaries. Subject to our investment guidelines for this portfolio, AIM, HPS and our other Investment Managers make all applicable investment decisions on our behalf.
As of December 31, 2019, we had $2,709.1 million of invested assets, with $846.9 million in our investment grade portfolio, of which $628.6 million were investment grade assets managed by AIM. The following chart describes the composition of our investment grade portfolio as of December 31, 2019:
Total: $846.9 million

Competition
The worldwide insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete, and will continue to compete, with major U.S. and non-U.S. insurers and reinsurers, many of which have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we do, as well as other potential providers of capital willing to assume insurance or reinsurance risk. We compete with other insurers and reinsurers primarily on the basis of overall financial strength, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, geographic scope of business, premiums charged, contract terms and conditions, products and services offered, speed of claims payment, general reputation and experience in the particular line of insurance to be written.
We also compete with new companies that continue to be formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets. In addition, continued consolidation within the industry will further enhance the already competitive underwriting environment. These consolidated entities may use their enhanced market power and broader capital base to negotiate price reductions for products and services that compete with ours and we may experience rate declines and possibly write less business. 
In our underwriting business, we compete with insurers that provide specialty P&C lines of insurance and reinsurance, including, among others: Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited, AXIS Capital Holdings Limited, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., Chubb Limited, Everest Re Group Ltd., Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited, Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd., Hannover Rückversicherung AG, Lloyd’s, Markel Corporation, Munich Re Group, PartnerRe Ltd., RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd., Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and AXA XL Ltd.
See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk factors-Risks related to our insurance and reinsurance business-We operate in a highly competitive environment and we may not be able to compete successfully in our industry.”
Employees
In accordance with our strategy to maintain an efficient operational structure with minimal fixed expenses, we have chosen to operate largely through experienced service partners, each of which is paid on a variable cost basis and which are monitored by our senior management team.
As of December 31, 2019, we had eleven full-time employees, nine of whom were based in Bermuda, one of whom was based in the United States and one of whom was based in Europe. In addition, pursuant to our services agreements with Arch, as of December 31, 2019, there were fifty-seven designated employees of Arch, who were provided to us on a non-exclusive basis to perform various services in connection with our insurance and reinsurance operations (including eight that were designated as officers of WSIC and/or WIC and, in such capacities, negotiate and bind reinsurance, execute documentation and perform other related functions for WSIC and/or WIC, as applicable). We believe that our employee relations are good. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements.
23

Information technology
Pursuant to our services agreements with Arch, Arch is responsible for the connectivity and maintenance of our information technology systems in Bermuda, the United States and Europe. These are the same systems that Arch utilizes for its own operations, accounting and to service its underwriting portfolios. Arch maintains the secure information technology environment, including secure Internet connections and electronic data transmission.
Such information technology and application systems are an important part of our underwriting process and our ability to compete successfully. We license the majority of our systems and data from third parties. Arch’s information technology team constantly monitors the system for breaches or failures, including those resulting from a cyberattack on us or our business partners and service providers.
We use our information technology systems to process, transmit, store and protect our electronic information, financial data and proprietary models that we utilize in our business and for the communications between our employees and our business, banking and investment partners.
Arch has established and implemented security measures, controls and procedures that it believes are appropriate to safeguard its and our information technology systems and to prevent unauthorized access to such systems and any data processed or stored in such systems, and our system is periodically evaluated and tested by expert third parties for the adequacy of such systems, controls and procedures. In addition, we have established, and continue to augment, a business continuity plan, which is designed to ensure that we are able to maintain all aspects of our key business processes functioning in the midst of certain disruptive events, including any disruptions to or breaches of our information technology systems. Our business continuity plan has been tested and evaluated for adequacy.
Regulation
General
Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the various jurisdictions in which they operate. We are subject to extensive regulation under applicable statutes in these countries and any other jurisdictions in which we operate. The current material regulations under which we operate are described below. We may become subject in the future to regulation in new jurisdictions or to additional regulations in existing jurisdictions.
Bermuda insurance regulation
The Insurance Act, pursuant to which the BMA regulates Watford Re, provides that no person shall carry on insurance or reinsurance business in or from within Bermuda, unless registered under the Insurance Act by the BMA. The Insurance Act does not distinguish between insurers and reinsurers: companies are registered under the Insurance Act as “insurers.” The Insurance Act uses the defined term “insurance business” to include reinsurance.
The BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance or reinsurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise. The registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to its complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose at any time.
The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards on Bermuda insurance and reinsurance companies, as well as auditing and reporting requirements. The Insurance Act also grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance and reinsurance companies.
24

Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework are set forth below.
Classification of insurers
The Insurance Act distinguishes between insurers and reinsurers carrying on long-term business, insurers and reinsurers carrying on general business and insurers and reinsurers carrying on special purpose business. There are six classifications of insurers and reinsurers carrying on general business, ranging from Class 1 insurers (pure captives subject to the lightest regulation) to Class 4 insurers (large commercial carriers subject to the most stringent regulation). Watford Re is licensed as a Class 4 insurer in Bermuda and is regulated as such under the Insurance Act.
Classification as a Class 4 insurer
A body corporate is registrable as a Class 4 insurer where (i) it has at the time of its application for registration, or will have before it carries on insurance or reinsurance business, a total statutory capital and surplus of not less than U.S. $100 million; and (ii) it intends to carry on general insurance and/or reinsurance business, including excess liability business or property catastrophe reinsurance business.
Minimum paid up share capital
Class 4 insurers are required to maintain fully paid-up share capital of at least U.S. $1 million.
Principal office and principal representative
As a Class 4 insurer, Watford Re is required to maintain a head and a principal office in Bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda. For the purposes of the Insurance Act, the principal office of Watford Re is located at Waterloo House, 1st Floor, 100 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke HM 08, Bermuda. Watford Re’s principal representative is Robert Hawley, the Chief Financial Officer of Watford Re.
Without a reason acceptable to the BMA, a Class 4 insurer may not terminate the appointment of its principal representative, and the principal representative may not cease to act as such, unless 30 days’ notice in writing to the BMA is given of the intention to do so.
It is the duty of the principal representative to forthwith notify the BMA where the principal representative reaches the view that there is a likelihood of the Class 4 insurer becoming insolvent, or on it coming to the knowledge of the principal representative, or the principal representative has reasonable grounds for believing that a reportable “event” has occurred. Examples of a reportable “event” include a failure by the Class 4 insurer to comply substantially with a condition imposed upon it by the BMA relating to a solvency margin or a liquidity or other ratio, a significant loss reasonably likely to cause the Class 4 insurer to fail to comply with its enhanced capital requirement (discussed below) and the occurrence of a “material change” (as such term is defined under the Insurance Act) in its business operations.
Within 14 days of such notification to the BMA, the principal representative must furnish the BMA with a written report setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to the principal representative.
Where there has been a significant loss which is reasonably likely to cause the Class 4 insurer to fail to comply with its enhanced capital requirement, the principal representative must also furnish the BMA with a capital and solvency return reflecting an enhanced capital requirement prepared using post-loss data. The principal representative must provide this within 45 days of notifying the BMA regarding the loss.
Furthermore, where a notification has been made to the BMA regarding a material change, the principal representative has 30 days from the date of such notification to furnish the BMA with 
25

unaudited interim statutory financial statements in relation to such period as the BMA may require, together with a general business solvency certificate in respect of those statements.
Head office
As a Class 4 insurer, Watford Re is required to maintain its head office in Bermuda and its insurance business must be directed and managed from Bermuda. In determining whether Watford Re satisfies this requirement, the BMA shall consider, among other things, the following factors: (i) where the underwriting, risk management and operational decision making of Watford Re occurs; (ii) whether the presence of senior executives who are responsible for, and involved in, the decision making related to the insurance business of Watford Re are located in Bermuda; and (iii) where meetings of the board of directors of Watford Re occur. In making its determination, the BMA may also have regard to: (i) the location where management of Watford Re meets to effect policy decisions of Watford Re; (ii) the residence of the officers, insurance managers or employees of Watford Re; and (iii) the residence of one or more directors of Watford Re in Bermuda. This provision does not apply to an insurer that has a permit to conduct business in Bermuda under the Companies Act or the Non-Resident Insurance Undertakings Act 1967.
Loss reserve specialist
As a Class 4 insurer, Watford Re is required to appoint an individual approved by the BMA to be its loss reserve specialist. In order to qualify as an approved loss reserve specialist, the applicant must be an individual qualified to provide an opinion in accordance with the requirements of the Insurance Act and the BMA must be satisfied that the individual is fit and proper to hold such an appointment.
A Class 4 insurer is required to submit annually an opinion of its approved loss reserve specialist with its capital and solvency return. The loss reserve specialist’s opinion must state, among other things, whether or not the aggregate amount of technical provisions shown in the statutory economic balance sheet as at the end of the relevant financial year: (i) meets the requirements of the Insurance Act and (ii) makes reasonable provision for the total technical provisions of the insurer or reinsurer under the terms of its insurance or reinsurance contracts and agreements.
Annual financial statements
Watford Re is required to prepare and submit, on an annual basis, audited GAAP and statutory financial statements, as defined below.
The Insurance Act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of statutory financial statements (which include, in statutory form, a balance sheet, an income statement, a statement of capital and surplus and notes thereto). The statutory financial statements include detailed information and analysis regarding premiums, claims, reinsurance and investments of the insurer or reinsurer.
In addition, Watford Re is also required to prepare and submit to the BMA financial statements which have been prepared under generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards, or GAAP financial statements. Watford Re’s annual GAAP financial statements and the auditor’s report thereon, and the statutory financial statements are required to be filed with the BMA within four months from the end of the relevant financial year (unless specifically extended with the approval of the BMA). The statutory financial statements do not form a part of the public records maintained by the BMA, but the GAAP financial statements are available for public inspection.
Declaration of compliance
At the time of filing its statutory financial statements, a Class 4 insurer is also required to deliver to the BMA a declaration of compliance, in such form and with such content as may be prescribed by 
26

the BMA, declaring whether or not the Class 4 insurer has, with respect to the preceding financial year: (i) complied with all requirements of the minimum criteria applicable to it; (ii) complied with the minimum margin of solvency as at its financial year end; (iii) complied with the applicable enhanced capital requirements as at its financial year end; (iv) complied with applicable conditions, directions and restrictions on, or approvals granted to, the Class 4 insurer; and (v) complied with the minimum liquidity ratio as at its financial year end. The declaration of compliance is required to be signed by two directors of the Class 4 insurer and if the Class 4 insurer has failed to comply with any of the requirements referenced in (i) through (v) above, the Class 4 insurer will be required to provide the BMA with particulars of such failure in writing. A Class 4 insurer shall be liable to a civil penalty by way of a fine for failure to comply with a duty imposed on it in connection with the delivery of the declaration of compliance.
Annual statutory financial return and annual capital and solvency return
As a Class 4 insurer, Watford Re is required to file with the BMA a statutory financial return no later than four months after its financial year end (unless specifically extended with the approval of the BMA). The statutory financial return of a Class 4 insurer shall consist of: (i) an insurer information sheet; (ii) an auditor’s report; (iii) the statutory financial statements; and (iv) notes to the statutory financial statements.
The insurer information sheet shall state, among other matters: (i) whether the general purpose financial statements of Watford Re for the relevant year have been audited and an unqualified opinion issued; (ii) the minimum margin of solvency applying to Watford Re and whether such margin was met; (iii) whether or not the minimum liquidity ratio applying to Watford Re for the relevant year was met; and (iv) whether or not Watford Re has complied with every condition attached to its certificate of registration. The insurer information sheet shall state if any of the questions identified in items (ii), (iii) or (iv) above is answered in the negative, whether or not Watford Re has taken corrective action in any case and, where Watford Re has taken such action, describe the action in an attached statement. The directors are required to certify whether the minimum solvency margin has been met.
Where an insurer’s accounts have been audited for any purpose other than compliance with the Insurance Act, a statement to that effect must be filed with the statutory financial return.
In addition, each year Watford Re is required to file with the BMA a capital and solvency return along with its annual statutory financial return. The prescribed form of capital and solvency return comprises Watford Re’s Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement, or BSCR, model or an approved internal capital model in lieu thereof (more fully described below), a schedule of fixed income and equity investments by BSCR rating, a schedule of funds held by ceding reinsurers in segregated accounts/trusts by BSCR rating, a schedule of net loss and loss expense provisions by line of business, a schedule of geographic diversification of net loss and loss expense provisions, a schedule of premiums written by line of business, a schedule of geographic diversification of net premiums written by line of business, a schedule of risk management, a schedule of fixed income securities, a schedule of commercial insurer’s solvency self-assessment, a schedule of catastrophe risk return, a schedule of loss triangles or reconciliation of net loss reserves, a schedule of eligible capital, a statutory economic balance sheet, the loss reserve specialist’s opinion, a schedule of regulated non-insurance financial operating entities, a schedule of solvency, a schedule of particulars of ceded reinsurance, a schedule of cash and cash equivalent counterparty analysis, a schedule of currency risk and a schedule of concentration risk.
Neither the statutory financial return nor the capital and solvency return is available for public inspection.

Quarterly financial return
As a Class 4 insurer, Watford Re is required to prepare and file quarterly financial returns with the BMA on or before the last day of the months of May, August and November of each year. The quarterly financial returns consist of: (i) quarterly unaudited financial statements for each financial quarter (which must minimally include a balance sheet and income statement and must also be recent and not reflect a financial position that exceeds two months); (ii) a list and details of material intra-group transactions that Watford Re is a party to and Watford Re’s risk concentrations that have materialized since the most recent quarterly or annual financial returns, details surrounding all intra-group reinsurance and retrocession arrangements and other intra-group risk transfer insurance business arrangements that have materialized since the most recent quarterly or annual financial returns; and (iii) details of the ten largest exposures to unaffiliated counterparties and any other unaffiliated counterparty exposures exceeding 10% of Watford Re’s statutory capital and surplus.
Public disclosures
Pursuant to recent amendments to the Insurance Act all commercial insurers, reinsurers, insurance groups and reinsurance groups are required to prepare and file with the BMA, and also publish on their website, a financial condition report. The BMA has discretion to approve modifications and exemptions to the public disclosure rules, on application by the insurer or reinsurer if, among other things, the BMA is satisfied that the disclosure of certain information will result in a competitive disadvantage or compromise confidentiality obligations of the insurer or reinsurer.
Independent approved auditor
A Class 4 insurer must appoint an independent auditor who will audit and report on the Class 4 insurer’s GAAP financial statements and provide audit assurance that its statutory financial statements were derived from its GAAP financial statements, each of which are required to be filed annually with the BMA.
Non-insurance business
No Class 4 insurer may engage in non-insurance business, unless that non-insurance business is ancillary to its core business. Non-insurance business means any business other than insurance or reinsurance business and includes carrying on investment business, managing an investment fund as operator, carrying on business as a fund administrator, carrying on banking business, underwriting debt or securities or otherwise engaging in investment banking, engaging in commercial or industrial activities and carrying on the business of management, sales or leasing of real property.
Minimum solvency margin and enhanced capital requirements
The Insurance Act provides that the value of the statutory assets of an insurer must exceed the value of its statutory liabilities by an amount greater than its prescribed minimum solvency margin, or MSM.
The MSM that must be maintained by a Class 4 insurer with respect to its general business is the greater of (i) $100 million or (ii) 50% of net premiums written (with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding 25% of gross premiums) or (iii) 15% of net loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves or (iv) 25% of the ECR as reported at the end of the relevant year.
Class 4 insurers are also required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of its ECR which is established by reference to either the BSCR model or an approved internal capital model.
The BSCR model is a risk-based capital model which provides a method for determining an insurer’s capital requirements (statutory economic capital and surplus) by taking into account the risk characteristics of different aspects of Watford Re’s business. The BSCR formula establishes capital 
28

requirements for ten categories of risk: fixed income investment risk, equity investment risk, interest rate/liquidity risk, currency risk, concentration risk, premium risk, reserve risk, credit risk, catastrophe risk and operational risk. For each category, the capital requirement is determined by applying factors to asset, premium, reserve, creditor, probable maximum loss and operation items, with higher factors applied to items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.
While not specifically referred to in the Insurance Act (or required thereunder), the BMA has also established a target capital level, or TCL, for each Class 4 insurer equal to 120% of its ECR. The TCL serves as an early warning tool for the BMA and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL will likely result in increased regulatory oversight.
Any Class 4 insurer which at any time fails to meet its MSM requirements must, upon becoming aware of such failure, immediately notify the BMA and, within 14 days thereafter, file a written report with the BMA containing particulars of the circumstances that gave rise to the failure and setting out its plan detailing specific actions to be taken and the expected timeframe in which Watford Re intends to rectify the failure.
Any Class 4 insurer which at any time fails to meet its applicable enhanced capital requirement shall upon becoming aware of that failure, or of having reason to believe that such a failure has occurred, immediately notify the BMA in writing and within 14 days of such notification file with the BMA a written report containing particulars of the circumstances leading to the failure; and a plan detailing the manner, specific actions to be taken and time within which Watford Re intends to rectify the failure and within 45 days of becoming aware of that failure, or of having reason to believe that such a failure has occurred, furnish the BMA with: (i) unaudited statutory economic balance sheets and unaudited interim statutory financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP covering such period as the BMA may require; (ii) the opinion of a loss reserve specialist in relation to the total general business insurance technical provisions as set out in the economic balance sheet, where applicable; (iii) a general business solvency certificate in respect of the financial statements; and (iv) a capital and solvency return reflecting an enhanced capital requirement prepared using post-failure data where applicable.
Eligible capital
To enable the BMA to better assess the quality of the Class 4 insurer’s capital resources, a Class 4 insurer is required to disclose the makeup of its capital in accordance with the “3-tiered eligible capital system.” Under this system, all of the Class 4 insurer’s capital instruments will be classified as either basic or ancillary capital which in turn will be classified into one of three tiers based on their “loss absorbency” characteristics. Highest quality capital will be classified Tier 1 Capital and lesser quality capital will be classified as either Tier 2 Capital or Tier 3 Capital. Under this regime, up to certain specified percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may be used to support the Class 4 insurer’s MSM, ECR and TCL.
The characteristics of the capital instruments that must be satisfied to qualify as Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital are set out in the Insurance (Eligible Capital) Rules 2012, and amendments thereto. Under these rules, Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may, until January 1, 2026, include capital instruments that do not satisfy the requirement that the instrument be non-redeemable or settled only with the issuance of an instrument of equal or higher quality upon a breach, or if it would cause a breach, of the ECR.
Minimum liquidity ratio
The Insurance Act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business insurers and reinsurers. A Class 4 insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities. Relevant assets include cash and time deposits, quoted investments, unquoted bonds and debentures, first liens on real estate, investment 
29

income due and accrued, accounts and premiums receivable, reinsurance balances receivable, funds held by ceding reinsurers and any other assets which the BMA, on application in any particular case made to it with reasons, accepts in that case.
Certain categories of assets which, unless specifically permitted by the BMA, do not automatically qualify as relevant assets, such as unquoted equity securities, investments in and advances to affiliates and real estate and collateral loans.
The relevant liabilities include total general business insurance and reinsurance reserves and total other liabilities less deferred income tax and letters of credit and guarantees.
Code of conduct
The Insurance Code of Conduct, or the Insurance Code prescribes the duties, standards, procedures and sound business principles which must be complied with by all insurers and reinsurers registered under the Insurance Act. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Code will be taken into account by the BMA in determining whether an insurer or reinsurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner as prescribed by the Insurance Act, may result in the BMA exercising its powers of intervention and investigation (see below) and will be a factor in calculating the operational risk charge under the insurer or reinsurer’s BSCR or approved internal model.
Restrictions on dividends and distributions
A Class 4 insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if it is in breach of its MSM, ECR or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such a breach. Where a Class 4 insurer fails to meet its MSM or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, it will be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the BMA.
In addition, a Class 4 insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year’s statutory balance sheet), unless it files (at least seven days before payment of such dividends) with the BMA an affidavit signed by at least two directors (one of whom must be a Bermuda-resident director if any of the Class 4 insurer’s directors are resident in Bermuda) and the principal representative stating that it will continue to meet its solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio. Where such an affidavit is filed, it shall be available for public inspection at the offices of the BMA.
Reduction of capital
A Class 4 insurer may not reduce its total statutory capital by 15% or more, as set out in its previous year’s financial statements, unless it has received the prior approval of the BMA. Total statutory capital consists of the insurer’s paid in share capital and its contributed surplus (sometimes called additional paid in capital) and any other fixed capital designated by the BMA as statutory capital (such as letters of credit).
A Class 4 insurer seeking to reduce its statutory capital by 15% or more, as set out in its previous year’s financial statements, is also required to submit an affidavit signed by at least two directors (one of whom must be a Bermuda-resident director if any of the Class 4 insurer’s directors are resident in Bermuda) and the principal representative stating that the proposed reduction will not cause it to fail its relevant margins and such other information as the BMA may require. Where such an affidavit is filed, it shall be available for public inspection at the offices of the BMA.
Supervision, investigation and intervention
The BMA may, by notice in writing served on a registered person or a designated insurer or reinsurer, require the registered person or designated insurer or reinsurer to provide such information and/or documentation as the BMA may reasonably require with respect to matters that are likely to be material to the performance of its supervisory functions under the Insurance Act. In 
30

addition, it may require the auditor, underwriter, accountant or any other person with relevant professional skill of such registered person or a designated insurer or reinsurer to prepare a report on any aspect pertaining thereto. In the case of a report, the person so appointed shall immediately give the BMA written notice of any fact or matter of which he becomes aware or which indicates to him that any condition attaching to his registration under the Insurance Act is not or has not, or may not be or may not have been fulfilled and that such matters are likely to be material to the performance of its functions under the Insurance Act. If it appears to the BMA to be desirable in the interests of the clients of a registered person or relevant insurance or reinsurance group, the BMA may also exercise these powers in relation to subsidiaries, parent companies and other affiliates of the registered person or designated insurer or reinsurer.
If the BMA deems it necessary to protect the interests of the policyholders or potential policyholders of an insurer, reinsurer, insurance group or reinsurance group, it may appoint one or more competent persons to investigate and report on the nature, conduct or state of the insurer, reinsurer, insurance group or reinsurance group’s business, or any aspect thereof, or the ownership or control of the insurer, reinsurer, insurance group or reinsurance group. If the person so appointed thinks it necessary for the purposes of his investigation, he may also investigate the business of any person who is or has been, at any relevant time, a member of the insurance group or reinsurance group or of a partnership of which the person being investigated is a member. In this regard, it shall be the duty of every person who is or was a controller, officer, employee, agent, banker, auditor, accountant, barrister, attorney or insurance manager to produce to the person appointed such documentation as he may reasonably require for the purpose of the investigation, and to attend and answer questions relevant to the investigation and to otherwise provide such assistance as may be necessary in connection therewith.
Where the BMA suspects that a person has failed to properly register under the Insurance Act or that a registered person or designated insurer or reinsurer has failed to comply with a requirement of the Insurance Act or that a person is not, or is no longer, a fit and proper person to perform functions in relation to a regulated activity, it may, by notice in writing, carry out an investigation into such person (or any other person connected thereto). In connection therewith, the BMA may require every person who is or was a controller, officer, employee, agent, banker, auditor, accountant, barrister, attorney or insurance manager to make a report and produce such documents in his care, custody and control and to attend before the BMA to answer questions relevant to the BMA’s investigation and to take such actions as the BMA may direct. The BMA may also enter any premises for the purposes of carrying out its investigation and may petition the court for a warrant if: (i) it believes a person has failed to comply with a notice served on him; (ii) there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the incompleteness of any information or documentation produced in response to such notice; or (iii) that its directions will not be complied with or that any relevant documents would be removed, tampered with or destroyed.
If it appears to the BMA that the business of the registered insurer or reinsurer is being conducted in a way that there is a significant risk of the insurer or reinsurer becoming insolvent or unable to meet its obligations to its policyholders, or that the insurer or reinsurer is in breach of the Insurance Act or any conditions imposed upon its registration, or the minimum criteria stipulated in the Insurance Act is not or has not been fulfilled in respect of a registered insurer or reinsurer, or that a person has become a controller without providing the BMA with the appropriate notice or in contravention of a notice of objection, or the registered insurer or reinsurer is in breach of its ECR, the BMA may issue such directions as it deems desirable for safeguarding the interests of the policyholders or potential policyholders of the insurer, reinsurer, insurance group or reinsurance group. The BMA may, among other things, direct an insurer or reinsurer: (i) not to take on any new insurance or reinsurance business; (ii) not to vary any insurance or reinsurance contract if the effect would be to increase its liabilities; (iii) not to make certain investments; (iv) to realize certain investments; (v) to maintain or transfer to the custody of a specified bank, certain assets; (vi) not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions or to restrict the making of such payments; (vii) to limit its premium income; (viii) not to enter into any specified transaction with any specified 
31

persons or persons of a specified class; (ix) to provide such written particulars relating to the financial circumstances of the insurer or reinsurer as the BMA thinks fit; (x) to obtain the opinion of a loss reserve specialist and to submit it to the BMA; and (xi) to remove a controller or officer.
Fit and proper controller
The BMA maintains supervision over the controllers of all registered insurers and reinsurers in Bermuda.
A controller includes: (i) the managing director of the registered insurer, reinsurer or its parent company; (ii) the chief executive of the registered insurer, reinsurer, or of its parent company; (iii) a 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% shareholder controller; and (iv) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer, reinsurer, or of its parent company are accustomed to act.
The definition of shareholder controller is set out in the Insurance Act, but generally refers to: (i) a person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at a shareholders’ meeting of the registered insurer, reinsurer, or its parent company; (ii) a person who is entitled to exercise 10% or more of the voting power at any shareholders’ meeting of such registered insurer, reinsurer, or its parent company; or (iii) a person who is able to exercise significant influence over the management of the registered insurer, reinsurer, or its parent company by virtue of its shareholding or its entitlement to exercise, or control the exercise of, the voting power at any shareholders’ meeting.
A shareholder controller that owns 10% or more, but less than 20% of the shares as described above is defined as a 10% shareholder controller. A shareholder controller that owns 20% or more, but less than 33% of the shares as described above is defined as a 20% shareholder controller. A shareholder controller that owns 33% or more but less than 50% of the shares as described above is defined as a 33% shareholder controller. A shareholder controller that owns 50% or more of the shares as described above is defined as a 50% shareholder controller.
Any person who becomes a 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% shareholder controller of us shall be required, within 45 days, to notify the BMA in writing that he or she has become such a controller. A shareholder controller is also required to serve notice in writing on the BMA within 45 days of reducing or disposing of shares such that it ceases to be a 50%, 33%, 20% or 10% shareholder controller. Any person who fails to give any such notice is guilty of an offense and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of U.S. $25,000.
The BMA may file a notice of objection to any person who has become a controller of any description where it appears that such person is not or is no longer, a fit and proper person to be a controller of the registered insurer or reinsurer. Before issuing a notice of objection, the BMA is required to serve upon the person concerned a preliminary written notice stating the BMA’s intention to issue formal notice of objection and the reasons for which it appears that the person is not or no longer considered a fit and proper person. Upon receipt of the preliminary written notice, the person served may, within 28 days, file written representations with the BMA, which shall be taken into account by the BMA in making their final determination. Any person who continues to be a controller of any description after having received a notice of objection shall be guilty of an offense and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of U.S. $25,000 (and a continuing fine of U.S. $500 per day for each day that the offense is continuing) or, if convicted on indictment, to a fine of U.S. $100,000 or two years in prison or both.
Notification of material changes
All registered insurers and reinsurers are required to give notice to the BMA of their intention to effect a material change within the meaning of the Insurance Act. For the purposes of the Insurance Act, the following changes are material: (i) the transfer or acquisition of insurance or reinsurance business being part of a scheme falling within, or any transaction relating to a scheme of arrangement under, Section 25 of the Insurance Act or Section 99 of the Companies Act; (ii) the 
32

amalgamation with or acquisition of another firm; (iii) engaging in unrelated business that is retail business; (iv) the acquisition of a controlling interest in an undertaking that is engaged in non-insurance or non-reinsurance business which offers services and products to persons who are not affiliates of the insurer or reinsurer; (v) outsourcing all or substantially all of the company’s actuarial, risk management compliance and internal audit functions; (vi) outsourcing all or a material part of an insurer or reinsurer’s underwriting activity; (vii) the transfer other than by way of reinsurance of all or substantially all of a line of business; (viii) the expansion into a material new line of business; (ix) the sale of an insurer or reinsurer; and (x) outsourcing the role of the chief executive or senior executive performing the duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters.
No registered insurer or reinsurer shall take any steps to give effect to a material change, unless it has first served notice on the BMA that it intends to effect such material change and before the end of 30 days, either the BMA has notified such company in writing that it has no objection to such change or that period has lapsed without the BMA having issued a notice of objection.
Before issuing a notice of objection, the BMA is required to serve upon the person concerned a preliminary written notice stating the BMA’s intention to issue a formal notice of objection. Upon receipt of the preliminary written notice, the person served may, within 28 days, file written representations with the BMA which shall be taken into account by the BMA in making their final determination.
Notification by registered person of change of controllers and officers
Watford Re, as a Class 4 insurer, is required to give written notice to the BMA of the fact that a person has become, or ceased to be, a controller or officer of the Class 4 insurer within 45 days of becoming aware of such fact. An officer in relation to a registered insurer or reinsurer means a director, chief executive or senior executive performing duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters.
Group supervision
The BMA may, in respect of an insurance group, determine whether it is appropriate for it to act as its group supervisor. An insurance group is defined as a group of companies that conducts insurance business. The Authority may make such determination where it ascertains that: (i) the group is headed by a “specified insurer” (that is to say, it is headed by either a Class 3A, Class 3B or Class 4 general business insurer or a Class C, Class D or Class E long-term insurer or another class of insurer designated by order of the BMA); (ii) where the insurance group is not headed by a “specified insurer,” where it is headed by a parent company which is incorporated in Bermuda; or (iii) where the parent company of the group is not a Bermuda company, in circumstances where the BMA is satisfied that the insurance group is directed and managed from Bermuda or the insurer with the largest balance sheet total is a specified insurer.
Where the BMA determines that it should act as the group supervisor, it shall designate a specified insurer that is a member of the insurance group to be the designated insurer, or the Designated Insurer, and it shall give to the Designated Insurer and other applicable insurance regulatory authority written notice of its intention to act as group supervisor. Before the BMA makes a final determination whether or not to act as group supervisor, it shall take into account any written representations made by the Designated Insurer submitted within such period as is specified in the notice.
The BMA may exclude any company that is a member of an insurance group from group supervision on the application of the Designated Insurer, or on its own initiative, provided the BMA is satisfied that: (i) the company is situated in a country or territory where there are legal impediments to cooperation and exchange of information; (ii) the financial operations of the company have a 
33

negligible impact on insurance group operations; or (iii) the inclusion of the company would be inappropriate with respect to the objectives of group supervision.
The BMA may, on its own initiative or on the application of the relevant Designated Insurer, include within group supervision a company that is a member of the group that is not on the Register of Group Particulars (described below) if it is satisfied the financial operations of the company in question may have a material impact on the insurance group’s operations and its inclusion would be appropriate having regard to the objectives of group supervision.
Once the BMA has been designated as group supervisor, the Designated Insurer must ensure that the insurance group of which it is a member appoints: (i) an individual approved by the BMA who is qualified as a group actuary to provide an opinion on the insurance group’s insurance technical provisions in accordance with the requirements of Schedule XIV “Group Statutory Economic Balance Sheet” of the Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Insurance Group Solvency Requirement) Rules 2011; and (ii) an auditor approved by the BMA to audit the financial statements of the group.
Pursuant to its powers under the Insurance Act, the BMA will maintain a register of particulars for every insurance group, or the Register of Group Particulars, for which it acts as the group supervisor, detailing the names and addresses of: (i) the Designated Insurer; (ii) each member company of the insurance group falling within the scope of group supervision; (iii) the principal representative of the insurance group in Bermuda; (iv) other competent authorities supervising other member companies of the insurance group; and (v) the insurance group auditors. The Designated Insurer must immediately notify the BMA of any changes to the above details entered on the Register of Group Particulars.
As group supervisor, the BMA will perform a number of supervisory functions including: (i) coordinating the gathering and dissemination of relevant or essential information for going concerns and emergency situations, including the dissemination of information which is of importance for the supervisory task of other competent authorities; (ii) carrying out supervisory reviews and assessments of the insurance group; (iii) carrying out assessments of the insurance group’s compliance with the rules on solvency, risk concentration, intra-group transactions and good governance procedures; (iv) planning and coordinating through regular meetings held at least annually (or by other appropriate means) with other competent authorities, supervisory activities in respect of the insurance group, both as a going concern and in emergency situations; (v) coordinating enforcement actions that may need to be taken against the insurance group or any of its members; and (vi) planning and coordinating meetings of colleges of supervisors in order to facilitate the carrying out of the functions described above.
The BMA may, for the purposes of group supervision, make rules applying to Designated Insurers which take into account any activities of the insurance group of which they are members or of other members of the insurance group. Such rules may make provision for the assessment of the financial situation of the insurance group; the solvency position of the insurance group (including the imposition of prudential standards in relation to enhanced capital requirements, capital and solvency returns, insurance reserves and eligible capital that must be complied with by the Designated Insurers); the system of governance and risk management of the insurance group; intra-group transactions and risk concentrations; and supervisory reporting and disclosure in respect of the insurance group.
Watford Re was designated by the BMA as a Designated Insurer on May 5, 2017 and as such we are currently subject to group supervision.
Disclosure of information
In addition to powers under the Insurance Act to investigate the affairs of an insurer or reinsurer, the BMA may require certain information from an insurer or reinsurer (or certain other persons) to be produced to the BMA. Further, the BMA has been given powers to assist other regulatory 
34

authorities, including foreign insurance regulatory authorities, with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda if it is satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities and that such cooperation is in the public interest. The grounds for disclosure are limited and the Insurance Act provides for sanctions for breach of the statutory duty of confidentiality.
Cancellation of insurer or reinsurer’s registration
An insurer or reinsurer’s registration may be canceled by the BMA on certain grounds specified in the Insurance Act. Failure by the insurer or reinsurer to comply with its obligations under the Insurance Act, or if the BMA believes that the insurer or reinsurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance or reinsurance principles, would be such grounds.
Certain other Bermuda law considerations
All Bermuda exempted companies are exempt from certain Bermuda laws restricting the percentage of share capital that may be held by non-Bermudians. However, exempted companies may not participate in certain business transactions, including: (i) the acquisition or holding of land in Bermuda except that required for their business held by way of lease or tenancy for a term not exceeding 50 years or, with the consent of the Minister of Economic Development granted in his discretion, land by way of lease or tenancy for a term not exceeding 21 years in order to provide accommodation or recreational facilities for its officers and employees; (ii) the taking of mortgages on land in Bermuda to secure an amount in excess of B.D.$50,000 without the consent of the relevant Ministers; (iii) the acquisition of any bonds or debentures secured by any land in Bermuda, other bonds or debentures issued by the Bermuda Government or a public authority; or (iv) the carrying on of business of any kind in Bermuda, except in furtherance of their business carried on outside Bermuda or under license granted by the Minister of Economic Development. Generally, it is not permitted without a special license granted by the Minister to insure or reinsure Bermuda domestic risks or risks of persons of, in or based in Bermuda.
All Bermuda companies must comply with the provisions of the Companies Act regulating the payment of dividends and making distributions from contributed surplus. A company may not declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that (i) it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (ii) the realizable value of its assets would thereby be less than its liabilities.
United States insurance regulation
General
In common with other insurers, our U.S.-based subsidiaries are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision in the various states and jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and licensed and/or approved to conduct business. The laws and regulations of the state of domicile have the most significant impact on operations. This regulation and supervision is designed to protect policyholders rather than investors. Generally, regulatory authorities have broad regulatory powers over such matters as licenses, standards of solvency, premium rates, policy forms, marketing practices, claims practices, investments, security deposits, methods of accounting, form and content of financial statements, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements, dividends and other distributions to shareholders, periodic examinations and annual and other report filings. 
In addition, transactions among affiliates, including reinsurance agreements or arrangements, as well as certain third-party transactions, require prior regulatory approval from, or prior notice to and no disapproval by, the applicable regulator under certain circumstances. Certain insurance regulatory requirements are highlighted below. In addition, regulatory authorities conduct periodic financial, claims and market conduct examinations.
35

Increased federal or state regulatory scrutiny could lead to new legal precedents, new regulations, new practices, or regulatory actions or investigations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
Credit for reinsurance
Except for certain mandated provisions that must be included in order for a ceding company to obtain credit for reinsurance ceded, the terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any governmental authority. This contrasts with admitted primary insurance policies and agreements, the rates and terms of which generally are regulated by state insurance regulators.
Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, provide that only the state in which a primary insurer is domiciled may regulate the financial statement credit for reinsurance taken by that primary insurer.
A primary insurer ordinarily will enter into a reinsurance agreement only if it can obtain credit for the reinsurance ceded on its U.S. statutory-basis financial statements. In general, credit for reinsurance is allowed in the following circumstances: if the reinsurer is licensed in the state in which the primary insurer is domiciled; if the reinsurer is an “accredited” or otherwise approved reinsurer in the state in which the primary insurer is domiciled; in some instances, if the reinsurer (i) is domiciled in a state that is deemed to have substantially similar credit for reinsurance standards as the state in which the primary insurer is domiciled and (ii) meets certain financial requirements; or if none of the above applies, to the extent that the reinsurance obligations of the reinsurer are collateralized appropriately, typically through the posting of a letter of credit for the benefit of the primary insurer or the deposit of assets into a trust fund established for the benefit of the primary insurer.
WIC is an admitted insurer in 50 states and the District of Columbia. WSIC is eligible to issue insurance on an excess and surplus lines basis in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Watford Re does not expect to become licensed, accredited or so approved in any U.S. jurisdiction.
On April 4, 2018, the United States and the European Union entered into the Bilateral Agreement between the United States and the European Union on Prudential Matters Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance, or the EU-US Covered Agreement, that, among other things, would eliminate reinsurance collateral requirements for qualified U.S. reinsurers operating in the EU insurance market, and eliminate reinsurance collateral requirements for qualified E.U. reinsurers operating in the U.S. insurance market. In December 2018, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and the U.S. Trade Representative announced that they had reached agreement with the United Kingdom on a covered agreement, or the UK-US Covered Agreement, that would extend terms nearly identical to the EU-US Covered Agreement to insurers and reinsurers operating in the United Kingdom in connection with the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. In June 2019, the NAIC adopted revisions to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation to address the reinsurance collateral provisions of the EU-US Covered Agreement and the UK-US Covered Agreement and that eliminate reinsurance collateral requirements for qualified reinsurers domiciled in other jurisdictions deemed “Reciprocal Jurisdictions”.
Holding company regulation
All states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems. These regulations generally provide that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. All transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and reasonable. Notice to the state insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of certain material transactions 
36

between an insurer and any entity in its holding company system. In addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated without the applicable insurance department’s prior approval, or its failure to disapprove after receiving notice. The holding company acts also prohibit any person from directly or indirectly acquiring control of a U.S. insurance company unless that person has filed an application with specified information with the insurance company’s domiciliary commissioner and has obtained the commissioner’s prior approval. Under most states’ statutes, including New Jersey (the state of domicile of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries), acquiring 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered an acquisition of control of the insurance company, although such presumption may be rebutted, as was the case for us, with Arch filing a disclaimer of control in connection with WSIC and WIC. Accordingly, any person or entity that acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of our voting securities without the prior approval of the commissioner will be in violation of these laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the commissioner or prohibiting the voting of those securities, or to other actions that may be taken by the commissioner. In 2010, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or the NAIC, adopted amendments to the Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation, which, among other changes, introduce the concept of “enterprise risk” within an insurance holding company system. If and when the amendments are adopted by a particular state, the amended Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation would impose more extensive informational requirements on parents and other affiliates of licensed insurers or reinsurers with the purpose of protecting them from enterprise risk, including requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the licensed companies. The amended Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act also requires any controlling person of a U.S. insurance company seeking to divest its controlling interest in the insurance company to file with the commissioner a confidential notice of the proposed divestiture at least 30 days prior to the cessation of control; after receipt of the notice, the commissioner shall determine those instances in which the parties seeking to divest or to acquire a controlling interest will be required to file for or obtain approval of the transaction. The amended Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation must be adopted by the individual states for the new requirements to apply to U.S. domestic insurers and reinsurers. To date, every state and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation adopting the amended Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act in some form.
Enterprise risk
The NAIC has increased its focus on risks within an insurer’s holding company system that may pose enterprise risk to the insurer. “Enterprise risk” is defined as any activity, circumstance, event or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied promptly, is likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or the liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. As noted above, in 2010, the NAIC adopted amendments to its Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation, which include, among other amendments, a requirement for the ultimate controlling person to file an enterprise risk report annually. In 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment, or ORSA, Model Act, which requires domestic insurers to maintain a risk management framework and establishes a legal requirement for domestic insurers to conduct an ORSA in accordance with the NAIC’s ORSA Guidance Manual. The ORSA Model Act provides that domestic insurers, or their insurance group, must regularly conduct an ORSA consistent with a process comparable to the ORSA Guidance Manual process. The ORSA Model Act also provides that, no more than once a year, an insurer’s domiciliary regulator may request that an insurer submit an ORSA summary report, or any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual, with respect to the insurer and/or the insurance group of which it is a member. If and when the ORSA Model Act is adopted by an individual state, the state may impose additional internal review and regulatory filing requirements on licensed insurers and their parent companies.

Regulation of dividends and other payments from insurance subsidiaries
The ability of an insurer to pay dividends or make other distributions is subject to insurance regulatory limitations of the insurance company’s state of domicile. Generally, such laws limit the payment of dividends or other distributions above a specified level. Dividends or other distributions in excess of such thresholds are “extraordinary” and are subject to prior regulatory approval. Such dividends or distributions may be subject to applicable withholding or other taxes. See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-Financial condition, liquidity and capital resources-Liquidity and capital resources” and Note 20 - “Statutory information” of the notes accompanying our financial statements.
Insurance regulatory information system ratios
The NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System, or the IRIS, was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is intended primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies 13 property/casualty industry ratios (referred to as IRIS ratios) and specifies usual ranges and identifies unusual values for each ratio. Departure from the usual values of the IRIS ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer’s business.
Accreditation
The NAIC has instituted its Financial Regulation Accreditation Standards Program, or FRASP, in response to federal initiatives to regulate the business of insurance. FRASP provides a set of standards designed to establish effective state regulation of the financial condition of insurance companies. Under FRASP, a state must adopt certain laws and regulations, institute required regulatory practices and procedures, and have adequate personnel to enforce such items in order to become an “accredited” state. If a state is not accredited, other states may not accept certain financial examination reports of insurers prepared solely by the regulatory agency in such unaccredited state. New Jersey, the state in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, is an accredited state.
Risk-based capital requirements
In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the NAIC adopted in December 1993 a formula and model law to implement risk-based capital requirements for property and casualty insurance companies. These risk-based capital requirements are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations. The risk-based capital model for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: underwriting, which encompasses the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing; declines in asset values arising from credit risk; and declines in asset values arising from investment risks.
An insurer will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending on how its statutory surplus compares to its risk-based capital calculation. For equity investments in an insurance company affiliate, the risk-based capital requirements for the equity securities of such affiliate would generally be our U.S.-based subsidiaries’ proportionate share of the affiliates’ risk-based capital requirement.
Under the approved formula, an insurer’s total adjusted capital is compared to its authorized control level risk-based capital. If this ratio is above a minimum threshold, no company or regulatory action is necessary. Below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to risk-based capital requirement decreases. The four action levels include: insurer is required to submit a plan for corrective action; insurer is subject to examination, analysis and specific corrective 
38

action; regulators may place insurer under regulatory control; and regulators are required to place insurer under regulatory control.
Each of our U.S. subsidiaries’ surplus (as calculated for statutory purposes) is above the risk-based capital thresholds that would require either company or regulatory action.
Guaranty funds and assigned risk plans
Most states require all admitted insurance companies to participate in their respective guaranty funds which cover certain claims against insolvent insurers. Solvent insurers licensed in these states are required to cover the losses paid on behalf of insolvent insurers by the guaranty funds and are generally subject to annual assessments in the states by the guaranty funds to cover these losses. Participation in state-assigned risk plans may take the form of reinsuring a portion of a pool of policies or the direct issuance of policies to insureds. The calculation of an insurer’s participation in these plans is usually based on the amount of premium for that type of coverage that was written by the insurer on a voluntary basis. Assigned risk pools tend to produce losses which result in assessments to insurers writing the same lines on a voluntary basis.
Federal regulation
Although state regulation is the dominant form of regulation for insurance and reinsurance business, the federal government in recent years has shown some concern over the adequacy of state regulation. It is not possible to predict the future impact of any potential federal regulations or other possible laws or regulations on our U.S.-based subsidiaries’ capital and operations, and such laws or regulations could materially adversely affect their business. In addition, a number of federal laws affect and apply to the insurance industry, including various privacy laws and the economic and trade sanctions implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. OFAC maintains and enforces economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and groups and prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in certain transactions with certain persons or entities. OFAC has imposed civil penalties on persons, including insurance and reinsurance companies, arising from violations of its economic sanctions program.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
The Dodd-Frank Act created the Federal Insurance Office, or FIO, within the Department of Treasury, which is not a federal regulator or supervisor of insurance, but monitors the insurance industry for systemic risk, administers the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, or TRIPRA, consults with the states regarding insurance matters and develops federal policy on aspects of international insurance matters. In addition, FIO is authorized to assist the Treasury Secretary in negotiating “covered agreements” between the U.S. and one or more foreign governments or regulatory authorities that address insurance prudential measures. Where a state law is inconsistent with a “covered agreement” and provides less favorable treatment to foreign insurers than U.S. companies, the FIO Director may preempt conflicting state law. In 2013, the FIO issued two reports relating to the insurance industry, one on modernization of the insurance regulatory system and one on the impact of Part II of the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010. In December 2014, the FIO issued a report on the vital role that the global reinsurance market plays in supporting insurance in the United States. The impact that these reports will have on the regulation of insurance, if any, is yet to be determined. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a uniform system for non-admitted insurance premium tax payments based on the home state of the policyholder and provides for single state regulation for financial solvency and credit for reinsurance as discussed above.
The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products and services under federal law. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB is charged with rulemaking and enforcement with respect to enumerated consumer laws. The Dodd-Frank Act also granted to the CFPB certain supervisory 
39

powers with respect to “covered persons” and “service providers,” as defined by the Dodd-Frank Act.
Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 was amended and extended again by TRIPRA through December 31, 2020. TRIPRA provides a federal backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from certain acts of terrorism on U.S. soil or against certain U.S. air carriers, vessels or foreign missions. Under TRIPRA, all U.S.-based property and casualty insurers are required to make terrorism insurance coverage available in specified commercial property and casualty insurance lines. Under TRIPRA, the federal government will pay 85% of covered losses after (i) aggregate industry insured losses resulting from the act of terrorism exceeds a statutorily prescribed program trigger, and (ii) an insurer’s losses exceed a deductible determined by a statutorily prescribed formula, up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. The program trigger for calendar year 2015 is $100 million and will increase by $20 million per year until it becomes $200 million in 2020. Beginning January 1, 2016, the 85% federal share will decrease by 1% per year until it becomes 80% in 2020. If an act (or acts) of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual limit, insurers with losses exceeding their deductibles will not be responsible for additional losses. An insurer’s deductible for each year is based on the insurer’s (together with those of its affiliates) direct commercial earned premiums for property and casualty insurance, excluding certain lines of business such as commercial auto, surety, professional liability and earthquake lines of business, for the prior calendar year multiplied by a specified percentage. The specified percentage for 2015 through 2020 is 20%. Our U.S.-based property and casualty insurers, WIC and WSIC, are subject to TRIPRA.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, or the GLBA, which implements fundamental changes in the regulation of the financial services industry in the United States, was enacted on November 12, 1999. The GLBA permits mergers that combine commercial banks, insurers and securities firms under one holding company, a “financial holding company.” Bank holding companies and other entities that qualify and elect to be treated as financial holding companies may engage in activities, and acquire companies engaged in activities, that are “financial” in nature or “incidental” or “complementary” to such financial activities. Such financial activities include acting as principal, agent or broker in the underwriting and sale of life, property, casualty and other forms of insurance and annuities.
Until the passage of the GLBA, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 had limited the ability of banks to engage in securities-related businesses, and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 had restricted banks from being affiliated with insurers. Since passage of the GLBA, among other things, bank holding companies may acquire insurers, and insurance holding companies may acquire banks. The ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may affect our U.S. subsidiaries’ product lines by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors.
The GLBA also imposes privacy requirements on financial institutions, such as insurance companies, including obligations to protect and safeguard consumers’ non-public personal information and records, and limitations on the re-use of such information. Federal regulatory agencies have issued Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards, or “Security Guidelines,” and interagency regulations regarding financial privacy, or “Privacy Rule,” implementing sections of GLBA. The Security Guidelines establish standards relating to administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security, confidentiality, integrity, and the proper disposal of consumer information. The Privacy Rule limits a financial institution’s disclosure of non-public personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless certain notice requirements are met and the consumer does not elect to prevent or “opt out” of the disclosure. The Privacy Rule also requires that privacy notices provided to customers and consumers describe the financial institutions’ policies and practices to protect the confidentiality and security of the information. Many states have 
40

enacted legislation implementing GLBA and establishing information security regulation. Many states have enacted privacy and data security laws which impose compliance obligations beyond GLBA, including obligations to protect social security numbers and provide notification in the event that a security breach results in a reasonable belief that unauthorized persons may have obtained access to consumer non-public information.
Legislative and regulatory proposals
From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been, and will be, proposed in the insurance and reinsurance industry. Among the proposals that have been considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers and the NAIC. In addition, there are a variety of proposals being considered by various state legislatures. Two ongoing areas of work at the NAIC are model rules relating to corporate governance and consideration of enhanced methods of group supervision.
Gibraltar insurance regulation
General
The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission, or the GFSC, regulates insurance and reinsurance companies, firms carrying out insurance mediation activities and insurance managers operating in Gibraltar. Insurance and reinsurance companies operate principally under the Financial Services (Insurance Companies) Act 1987 and, since January 1, 2016, also under the Financial Services (Insurance Companies) (Solvency II Directive) Act 2015. Insurance intermediaries and insurance managers operate principally under the Financial Services (Investment & Fiduciary Services) Act 1989. In addition, insurance companies, intermediaries and managers are subject to a range of further laws and regulations.
On July 28, 2015, WICE was licensed by the GFSC. It holds permissions to write the following classes and is authorized to do business in the following territories:

• | United Kingdom: 3 (Land Vehicles), 10 (Motor Vehicle Liability);


• | France: 1 (Accident), 3 (Land Vehicles), 8 (Fire and Natural Forces), 9 (Damage to Property), 10 (Motor Vehicle Liability), 13 (General Liability); and


• | Ireland: 1 (Accident), 3 (Land Vehicles), 8 (Fire and Natural Forces), 9 (Damage to Property), 10 (Motor Vehicle Liability), 13 (General Liability).

The GFSC’s mission statement states that its mission is “to provide financial services regulation in an effective and efficient manner in order to promote good business, protect the public from financial loss and enhance Gibraltar’s reputation as a quality financial centre.” Underpinning this mission statement, the GFSC’s regulatory objectives are the promotion of market confidence, the reduction of systemic risk, the promotion of public awareness, the protection of the good reputation of Gibraltar, the protection of consumers and the reduction of financial crime.
The GFSC is responsible both for supervising the application of prudential standards and the conduct of firms across the Gibraltar financial services sector. This includes, but is not limited to banks, insurance companies, insurance intermediaries, e-money issuers, payment service institutions, investment firms, fund service providers, funds, fiduciary service providers and auditors.
Gibraltar financial service firms, including insurance and reinsurance companies, which passport their services into another EU member state are also subject to the conduct and general good provision in that member state, as set out by the host state regulator.

Financial resources
WICE is required to have adequate financial assets and to file quarterly returns to the GFSC. WICE adopts the Standard Formula as postulated under Solvency II to calculate its regulatory solvency capital requirement, or SCR. In addition to this, WICE is required to carry out its own risk and solvency assessment at least annually, taking into account its specific risk profile and risk appetite to formulate an internal view of the appropriate level of capital.
The calculation of the SCR takes account of market risk, insurance risk (underwriting and reserving), counterparty risk and operational risk. The ORSA also takes account of other risks facing the business, such as liquidity risk and group risk.
The GFSC requires insurance and reinsurance companies to maintain an appropriate buffer above the SCR, but this is not prescriptive. The buffer is expected to be appropriate to the risk profile and type of business written.
WICE maintains a level of capital which is above both the SCR and the internally derived view of capital required.
Financial services compensation scheme
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme, or FSCS, is a scheme established under FSMA to compensate eligible policyholders of insurance and reinsurance companies who may become insolvent. The FSCS is funded by the levies that it has the power to impose on all insurers and reinsurers. As a motor insurer writing into the U.K. market, WICE contributes to the FSCS.
Motor insurance bureau
The Motor Insurance Bureau in the United Kingdom, or MIB, and the Motor Insurance Bureau Ireland, or MIBI, provide compensation where an individual is injured by an uninsured driver. As an insurance and reinsurance company writing motor business into the U.K. and Ireland, WICE is a member of both the MIB and the MIBI and pays the appropriate levies.
Additional restrictions
When granting a license, the GFSC issues a Notice of Requirements, or NOR, which imposes further restrictions on a licensee over and above those set out in legislation. The key restrictions applicable to WICE include the following:
Restriction on business to be written
WICE is required to obtain prior written approval of the GFSC if it plans to make any significant change to the business that it writes.
Restrictions on transactions with connected parties
WICE is required to obtain prior written consent from the GFSC if it enters into certain transactions with connected parties. This includes: (i) agreements which will result in payments in excess of $40,000; (ii) the acquisition of property in excess of $40,000; (iii) other property-related arrangements including, but not limited to, mortgages, charges and leases above $40,000; (iv) undertaking any liability to meet an obligation of a connected party; (v) loans to connected parties exceeding $40,000; and (vi) entering into or varying a reinsurance agreement with a connected party without giving the GFSC 14 days prior written notice.
Changes to WICE’s operations
WICE must inform the GFSC of any significant change in its insurance or reinsurance arrangements, a change in the name of its bankers or the address of the branch where the account is held, or a change in its auditors.
42

Provision of information
WICE must send to the GFSC, within 14 days, copies of insurance or reinsurance agreements, agreements for the provision of insurance management services or changes to agreements and new or revised agreements with investment managers.
Restriction on dividends
WICE is required to notify the GFSC of any proposal to declare or pay a dividend and is required to provide relevant financial information which has been considered by its board of directors in considering this proposal. WICE is not permitted to pay any such dividend within 14 days of such notice to the GFSC.
In order to obtain regulatory approval for the payment of a dividend, WICE must demonstrate that it will continue to meet its SCR and its internal view of capital following the payment of such dividend.
Other matters
The NOR imposes a requirement on WICE to comply with certain other matters:

• | A business plan must be submitted prior to December 1 of each financial year;


• | WICE must obtain an annual independent actuarial review of loss reserves;


• | WICE must provide the GFSC with a copy of any management report provided by its auditors within two weeks of receipt;


• | WICE must submit to the GFSC copies of board of director and committee minutes and board of directors and committee packs on a quarterly basis once the meetings have been held; and


• | WICE must hold quarterly meetings of its board of directors.

European Union considerations
Through its authorization in Gibraltar, which is a British Overseas Territory of the U.K. and therefore has been able to benefit from certain rights available to Member States of the EU, WICE’s authorization is recognized throughout the European Economic Area, subject only to certain notification and application requirements. This authorization enables WICE to provide services or to establish a branch in any other Member State of the EU, where such entity will be subject to the insurance regulations of each such Member State with respect to the conduct of its business in such Member State, but remain subject only to the financial, prudential and operational supervision by the GFSC. The framework for the passporting of services and the establishment of branches in Member States of the EU was generally set forth, and remains subject to, directives adopted by the Council, the legislative body of the European Union, which directives are then implemented in each Member State. WICE currently passports under the Freedom of Services provisions into the United Kingdom, France and Ireland.
The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” may adversely impact our European operations by limiting or removing WICE’s current ability to flexibly transact insurance business across the borders of European Union members. Alternative avenues to distribute our insurance products in Europe exist but may prove to be more costly and/or less economical, and a reduction in premium writings from Europe would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks related to regulation of us and our operating subsidiaries-The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union could adversely affect us.”
