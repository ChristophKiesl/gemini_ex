Introduction

Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. is organized under the laws of British Columbia, Canada. In this Annual Report, the Company, we, our and us refer to Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. and its subsidiaries. 

The Companys operations are classified into four reportable segments which were determined based on the nature of the products offered along with the markets being served. The segments are as follows:

 Industrial tools and clamps

Effective September 1, 2013, the Company reorganized certain of its subsidiaries. Jewett-Cameron Lumber Corporation (JCLC) was changed to JC USA Inc. (JC USA), which has the following four wholly-owned subsidiaries.

JCC is a wholesaler of wood products and a manufacturer and distributor of specialty metal products formerly conducted by JCLC. Wood products include fencing and landscape timbers, while metal products include dog kennels, proprietary gate support systems, perimeter fencing, and greenhouses. JCC uses contract manufacturers to make the specialty metal products. Some of the products that JCC distributes flow through the Companys distribution center located in North Plains, Oregon, and some are shipped direct to the customer from the manufacturer. Primary customers are home centers and other retailers. 

The seed processing and sales segment reflects the business of Jewett-Cameron Seed Company (JCSC). JCSC processes and distributes agricultural seed. Most of this segments sales come from selling seed to distributors with a lesser amount of sales derived from cleaning seed.

The industrial tools and clamps segment reflects the business of MSI-PRO (MSI). MSI imports and distributes products including pneumatic air tools, industrial clamps, and saw blades. These products are primarily sold to retailers that in turn sell to contractors and end users.

General Development of Business

Incorporation and Subsidiaries

Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. was incorporated under the Company Act of British Columbia on July 8, 1987 as a holding company for Jewett-Cameron Lumber Corporation (JCLC), which was incorporated in September 1953. Jewett-Cameron Trading Company, Ltd. acquired all the shares of JCLC through a stock-for-stock exchange on July 13, 1987, and at that time JCLC became a wholly owned subsidiary. Effective September 1, 2013, the Company completed a reorganization of certain of its subsidiaries and JCLCs name was changed to JC USA Inc. (JC USA). JC USA has the following wholly owned subsidiaries. MSI-PRO Co. (MSI), incorporated in April 1996, Jewett-Cameron Seed Company, (JCSC), incorporated in October 2000, Greenwood Products, Inc. (Greenwood), incorporated in February 2002, and Jewett-Cameron Company (JCC) incorporated in September 2013. Jewett-Cameron Trading Company, Ltd. and its subsidiaries have no significant assets in Canada.
Corporate Development

Incorporated in 1953, JC USA operated as a small lumber wholesaler based in Portland, Oregon. In September 1984, the original stockholders sold their interest in the corporation to a new group of investors. Two members of that group remain active in the Company. These individuals are Donald Boone, current Chairman and Director and the former President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer, and Principal Financial Officer; and Michael Nasser, Corporate Secretary.

In July 1987, the Company acquired JC USA in what was not an arms-length transaction.

In early 1986, prior to JC USA being acquired by the Company, JC USA acquired Material Supply International (Material Supply). Material Supply was engaged in the importation and distribution of pneumatic air tools and industrial clamps. The product line was re-branded as MSI-PRO and MSI was incorporated in 1996 to carry-on the business of Material Supply.

In October 2000, JCSC was incorporated in anticipation of JC USA acquiring the business and certain assets of a firm called Agrobiotech Inc. JCSC operates as a seed storage, processing and sales business.

In February 2002, Greenwood was incorporated in anticipation of JC USA acquiring the business and certain assets of Greenwood Forest Products Inc. Greenwood is involved in the processing and distribution of specialty wood products.

In June 2012, the Company acquired land and fixed assets located in Manning, Oregon for $250,000 cash.

Narrative Description of Business

The Companys operations are classified into four segments. Sales, income before taxes, assets, depreciation and amortization, capital expenditures, and interest expense by segment are shown in the footnotes to the financial statements.
Lawn, Garden, Pet and Other  JCC 

The lawn, garden, pet and other segment reflects the business of the recently incorporated Jewett-Cameron Company (JCC), which is a manufacturer and distributor of specialty metal products and a wholesaler of wood products formerly conducted by JCLC. 

JCC operates out of a 5.6 acre owned facility located in North Plains, Oregon that includes an office, a warehouse, a paved yard, and a remanufacturing plant. This business is a wholesaler of wood products and a manufacturer and distributor of specialty metal products. Wood products are primarily fencing, while metal products include pet enclosures and kennels, proprietary gate support systems, perimeter fencing, greenhouses, canopies and umbrellas. Examples of the Companys brands include Lucky Dog, Animal House and AKC (used under license from the American Kennel Club) for pet enclosures and kennels; Adjust-A-Gate, Fit-Right, and Perimeter Patrol for gates and fencing; Early Start, Spring Gardner, and Weatherguard for greenhouses; and TrueShade for patio umbrellas, furniture covers and canopies. JCC uses contract manufacturers to make the specialty metal products. Some of the products that JCC distributes flow through the Companys facility in North Plains, Oregon, and some are shipped direct to the customer from the manufacturer. Primary customers are home centers and other retailers. 

The home improvement business is seasonal, with higher levels of sales occurring between February and August. Inventory buildup occurs until the start of the season in February and then gradually declines to seasonal low levels at the end of the summer. 

JCC has concentrated on building a customer base for lawn, garden, and pet related products. Management believes this market is less sensitive to downturns in the U.S. economy than is the market for new home construction.

The wood products that JCC distributes are not unique and are available from multiple suppliers. However, the metal products that JCC manufactures and distributes may be somewhat differentiated from similar products available from other suppliers.

JCC owns the patents and manufacturing rights connected with the Adjust-A-Gate and Fit-Right products, which are the gate support systems for wood, vinyl, chain link, and composite fences. Management believes the ownership of these patents results in an important competitive advantage for these and certain other products. During fiscal 2017, the Company applied for 3 new patents (fiscal 2016  4), while 4 other patents were granted (fiscal 2016  4). JCC also has two licensing agreements to market pet products. 

Backlog orders are a factor in this business as customers may place firm priced orders for both wood and metal products for shipments to take place three to four months in the future.

Industrial Wood Products - Greenwood

Greenwood is a wholesale distributor of a variety of specialty wood products. Operations are co-located in the building utilized by JCC and MSI.

Historically, a major product category has been treated plywood that is sold to boat manufacturers and the transportation industry. In February 2014, the Company sold its excess inventory related to the marine industry. Greenwoods total sales for fiscal 2017 and 2016 were 8% and 10% respectively of total Company sales.

The markets in which Greenwood competes are sensitive to downturns in the U.S economy. 

Inventory is maintained at non-owned warehouse and wood treating facilities throughout the United States and is primarily shipped to customers on a just-in-time basis. Inventory is generally not purchased on a speculative basis in anticipation of price changes.

Greenwood has no significant backlog of orders.

Seed Processing and Sales - JCSC 

JCSC operates out of an approximately 12 acre owned facility located adjacent to North Plains, Oregon. JCSC processes and distributes agricultural seed. Most of this segments sales come from selling seed to distributors with a lesser amount of sales derived from cleaning seed. Even though the harvest and processing cycle is seasonal, sales of JCSC tend to be fairly uniform throughout the year. However, profitability around the month of August may be unusually high based on a seasonal surge in cleaning sales, which are much more profitable sales than product sales. 

JCSC has no backlog of sales orders.

Industrial Tools and Clamps - MSI

This business operates from the same owned facilities as JCC. MSI imports and distributes products including pneumatic air tools, industrial clamps, and saw blades. These products are primarily sold to retailers that in turn sell to contractors and end users. Sales of these products tend to be relatively uniform throughout the year. 

MSIs product line was expanded in 2007 to include saw blades, digital calipers, and laser guides. MSI brands include MSI-Pro, Avenger, and ProMax.

Customer Concentration

The top ten customers were responsible for 79% and 78% of total Company sales for the years ended August 31, 2017 and August 31, 2016, respectively. Also, the Companys single largest customer was responsible for 32% and 33% of total Company sales for the years ended August 31, 2017 and August 31, 2016 respectively. 
Employees

As of August 31, 2017 the Company had 59 full-time employees (August 31, 2016  52 full-time employees). By segment these employees were located as follows: Greenwood 2, JCC 29, JCSC 9, MSI 5, and JC USA 14. None of these employees are represented by unions at the Company. Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd. has no direct employees, and the CEO of the Company is employed by JC USA.
