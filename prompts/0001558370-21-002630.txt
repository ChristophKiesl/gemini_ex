Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. Unless the context otherwise indicates, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “we”, “our”, “us”, “our Company”, “the Company”, and “Michaels” mean The Michaels Companies, Inc., together with its subsidiaries.
​
General
​
The Michaels Companies, Inc., with $5.3 billion in sales in fiscal 2020, is the largest arts and crafts specialty retailer in North America (based on store count) providing materials, project ideas and education for creative activities. Our mission is to inspire and enable customer creativity, create a fun and rewarding place to work, foster meaningful connections with our communities and lead the industry in growth and innovation. With crafting classes, store events, store displays, mobile applications and online videos, we offer an omnichannel shopping experience that can inspire creativity and build confidence in our customers’ artistic abilities. 
​
As of January 30, 2021, we operated 1,252 Michaels retail stores in 49 states and Canada, with approximately 18,000 average square feet of selling space per store. 
​
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. In response to the pandemic, many state and local jurisdictions ordered non-essential businesses closed and executed extensive stay-at-home orders. These orders resulted in the temporary closure of over 900 of our 1,252 stores which had a material adverse impact on our results of operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we reopened all of our stores and experienced a significant improvement in our business as net sales increased 12.4% during the preceding nine month period ending January 30, 2021 compared to the same period in the prior year. Our liquidity position, which includes cash on hand and amounts available under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (“Amended Revolving Credit Facility”), increased from $1.2 billion as of February 1, 2020 to $1.7 billion as of January 30, 2021. However, there remains significant uncertainty surrounding the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, and future waves of the pandemic could require us to close stores again if certain restrictions are reinstated by state and local authorities. We intend to continue to manage our liquidity position closely and invest in our omnichannel capabilities to meet the growing customer demand for a seamless omnichannel experience.
​
In May 2020, the Company adopted a plan to close our Darice wholesale operations (“Darice”). As a result of the closure, we recorded a charge totaling $45.2 million in fiscal 2020, consisting primarily of a $37.3 million charge in gross profit related to the liquidation of inventory and $7.9 million included in selling, general and administrative associated with the write-off of indefinite-lived intangible assets and employee-related expenses. The closure of Darice was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, Darice’s net sales totaled $37.6 million and $79.9 million, respectively. Excluding the charges, Darice did not have a material impact on the Company’s operating income in the periods presented.
​
In fiscal 2020, we recorded impairment charges totaling $28.8 million, consisting of $19.4 million related to the closure of 13 underperforming stores and $9.4 million primarily related to the relocation of our corporate offices in Irving, Texas. The impairment charges include $22.8 million related to operating lease assets and $6.0 million related to leasehold improvements and inventory.
​

3




During fiscal 2019, we identified impairment indicators within Darice that were primarily due to a deterioration in sales associated with overall declining demand from customers. These indicators led us to revise Darice’s forecasted sales downward and resulted in a significantly lower operating plan in fiscal 2019. As a result, we performed impairment tests on Darice’s goodwill, indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, including operating lease assets. As a result of this impairment testing, we recorded an impairment charge of $40.1 million in fiscal 2019, consisting of $17.8 million related to goodwill, $14.4 million related to long-lived assets, including operating lease assets, and $7.9 million related to indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets.
​
In November 2019, the Company acquired certain intangible assets from A.C. Moore Incorporated for $61.9 million, including customer relationships and tradenames totaling $55.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively. In connection with the transaction, we also leased a distribution facility in New Jersey and 17 store locations. The store locations will be reopened under the Michaels brand name during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, including the relocation of certain existing Michaels stores. We believe the transaction will enable us to expand our presence in strategic markets and better serve our customers both online and in stores.
​
In January 2019 and March 2018, we closed our Pat Catan’s and Aaron Brothers stores, respectively. As a result of the store closures, we recorded restructure charges of $8.2 million and $98.9 million in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. The restructure charges in fiscal 2019 are primarily related to employee-related expenses and the impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. The restructure charges in fiscal 2018 primarily related to the transfer of the rights to sell inventory and other assets to a third party to facilitate the store closures and assist with the disposition of our remaining lease obligations, the impairment of goodwill and employee-related expenses.
​
During fiscal 2018, Pat Catan’s net sales totaled $109.6 million and Aaron Brothers net sales totaled $12.9 million. Excluding the restructure charges, Aaron Brothers and Pat Catan’s did not have a material impact on the Company’s operating income in all fiscal periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
​
In addition, we recorded $5.3 million of employee-related charges in fiscal 2018 as a result of certain organizational changes made to streamline our operations at our corporate support center.
​
Pending Acquisition by Apollo
​
On March 2, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”) with certain affiliates of Apollo Global Management (such affiliates, “Apollo”), pursuant to which Apollo will acquire the Company. Under the Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Apollo will commence a tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Michaels for $22.00 per share in cash. If certain conditions are satisfied and the offer closes, Apollo will acquire all remaining shares not tendered in the tender offer through a second-step merger at the same price. The tender offer will initially remain open for twenty business days, subject to possible extension on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement. The parties currently expect the acquisition to be completed during the first half of fiscal 2021. Apollo’s obligations to complete the acquisition are subject to certain customary closing conditions, including a majority of the outstanding shares of Michaels common stock having been tendered and not validly withdrawn, the expiration of a twenty-five day go-shop period, compliance with certain antitrust requirements in the United States and Canada, and the completion of a specified marketing period for Apollo’s debt financing of the offer price. The Merger Agreement also provides that the acquisition agreement may be terminated by us or Apollo under certain circumstances, and in certain specified circumstances upon termination of the Merger Agreement we will be required to pay Apollo a termination fee of up to $104 million. The anticipated acquisition of the Company by Apollo is described more fully in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021. This summary of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Annual Report.

Merchandising
​
Michaels. Each Michaels store offers approximately 45,000 basic and seasonal stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) in a number of product categories. The following table shows a breakdown of sales for Michaels stores by department as a percentage of total net sales:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
------------------------------+---+-------------+---+------+---+------+--
​ | ​ | Fiscal Year | 
​ | | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018 | 
General crafts | | 47 | % | 47 | % | 48 | %
Home décor and seasonal | | 22 | ​ | 23 | ​ | 24 | ​

Papercrafting | | 15 | ​ | 14 | ​ | 12 | ​
​ | | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

​
We have category merchant, product development, sourcing and design teams focused on quality, innovation and cost mitigation. Our internal product development and global sourcing teams position us to deliver a differentiated level of innovation, quality and value to our customers. Our global sourcing network allows us to control new product introductions, maintain quality standards, monitor delivery times, and manage product costs and inventory levels to enhance profitability. In an industry with few well-known national brands, our private brands are recognized as a leader in many categories. We continue to expand our private brands and improve the selection of products we design, develop and deliver to our customers. Our Michaels’ private brands totaled approximately 59% of net sales in fiscal 2020 and include, among others, Recollections®, Studio Decor®, Bead Landing®, Creatology®, Ashland®, Celebrate It®, ArtMinds®, Artist’s Loft®, Craft Smart® and Loops & Threads®.
​
We continue to search for ways to leverage our position as a market leader by establishing strategic partnerships and exclusive product relationships to provide our customers with exciting merchandise. We have partnerships with popular brands such as Crayola, Elmer’s and Cricut. We will continue to explore opportunities to form future partnerships and exclusive product associations. 
​
E-commerce. Our e-commerce business provides an important avenue to communicate with our customers in an interactive way that reinforces the Michaels brand and drives traffic to our stores and websites. We continue to strengthen our omnichannel offering with the expansion of our buy online, pick up in store capabilities and the introduction of curbside pick-up and same-day-delivery during fiscal 2020. We also continue to enhance our existing platforms to improve discoverability, product content and personalization of customer messaging that will deliver a superior customer experience. Our online platforms, which offer over 100,000 basic and seasonal SKUs, currently include Michaels.com, Canada.Michaels.com, michaelscustomframing.com (our online custom framing solution) and our Michaels app, which connects our store and online experiences. 
​
Purchasing and Inventory Management
​
We purchase merchandise from a variety of different vendors primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Michaels Stores Procurement Company, Inc. We believe our buying power and ability to make centralized purchases enable us to acquire products on favorable terms. Centralized merchandising management teams negotiate with vendors in an attempt to obtain the lowest merchandise costs and to improve product mix and inventory levels. In fiscal 2020, there were no vendors who accounted for more than 10% of total purchases.
​
We have also developed direct sourcing capabilities through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Darice International Sourcing Group. We believe our direct sourcing operation allows us to maintain greater control over the manufacturing process, resulting in improved product quality and lower costs. In addition, our stores purchase custom frames, framing supplies and mats from our wholly-owned subsidiary, Artistree, Inc. (“Artistree”), which consists of a manufacturing facility and three regional processing centers. 
​
The majority of the products sold in our stores are manufactured in Asia. Goods manufactured in Asia generally require long lead times and are ordered two to four months in advance of delivery. Those products are either imported directly by us or acquired from distributors based in the U.S.
​

Our automated replenishment system uses perpetual inventory records to analyze on-hand SKU quantities by store, as well as other pertinent information such as sales forecasts, seasonal selling patterns, promotional events and vendor lead times, to generate recommended merchandise reorder information. These recommended orders are reviewed daily and purchase orders are delivered electronically to our vendors and our distribution centers. In addition to improving our store in-stock position, these systems enable us to better forecast merchandise ordering quantities for our vendors and give us the ability to identify, order and replenish the stores’ merchandise. These systems also allow us to react more quickly to sales trends and allow our store team members to devote more time to customer service, thereby improving inventory productivity and sales opportunities.
​
Artistree
​
We own and operate Artistree, a vertically-integrated framing operation which supplies precut mats and high quality custom framing merchandise in our stores and on michaelscustomframing.com. We believe Artistree provides a competitive advantage and gives us quality control over the entire framing process. Custom framing orders are processed and shipped to our stores where the custom frame order is completed for customer pick-up.
​
Our moulding manufacturing plant, located in Kernersville, North Carolina, converts lumber into finished frame moulding that is used at our regional processing centers to fulfill custom framing orders for our customers. We manufacture approximately 38% of the moulding that we process and import approximately 56% from quality manufacturers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Spain and Italy. The remaining mouldings are purchased from domestic manufacturers. 
​
We operate three regional processing centers located in DFW Airport, Texas; Kernersville, North Carolina; and Mississauga, Ontario. Combined, these facilities occupy approximately 489,000 square feet and, in fiscal 2020, processed 18.7 million linear feet of frame moulding and 2.8 million individual custom cut mats and foam boards for our customers. Our precut mats and custom frame supplies are packaged and distributed out of our DFW Airport regional processing center.
​
Distribution
​
We currently operate eight distribution centers to supply our stores with merchandise. Approximately 94% of our stores’ merchandise receipts are shipped through the distribution network with the remainder shipped directly from vendors to stores. Our distribution centers are located in California, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Washington. In fiscal 2020, we began work on additional distribution centers in California and New Jersey which are expected to begin operations in the second half of fiscal 2021. We also began to wind down operations in our Ohio distribution centers which were primarily used for our discontinued wholesale business. In fiscal 2021, we plan to operate eight distribution centers in direct support of Michaels sales channels, and sublease our Ohio distribution centers.
​
Our distribution facilities use warehouse management and control software systems to maintain and support the efficient movement of product through our supply chain. Store replenishment is performed using pick-to-light and radio frequency processing technologies as well as other common material handling equipment. Product is delivered to stores using both a dedicated fleet of trucks and contract carriers. 
​
Marketing
​
We employ a multi-faceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness, acquire new customers, improve customer retention and increase frequency of shopping. We communicate with our current and prospective customers through multiple channels, including direct mail, email, newspaper inserts, television and digital advertising.
​
We continue to develop and leverage our customer data analytic capabilities to drive a more customer-centric strategy through targeted marketing and promotions. We believe that targeted marketing and promotions play an important role in today’s retail environment by improving the impact of digital media, email, coupons and promotional events. In fiscal 2020, we expanded our loyalty program, Michaels Rewards, enabling customers to earn rewards on purchases that can be redeemed for discounts on future purchases. Michaels Rewards also offers customers tailored, exclusive offers and events such as sneak peeks for new product, early alerts for big sales and receipt-free returns. Michaels Rewards continues to grow and has surpassed 46 million customers. The program adds to our customer database and, we believe, will allow 

6




us to further target our marketing and promotions more effectively. We believe the expansion of our rewards program is an important tool to increase retention of existing customers and enhance their loyalty to the Michaels brand.
​
Seasonality
​
Our business is highly seasonal, with higher sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Our fourth quarter, which includes the Holiday selling season, has on average accounted for approximately 34% of our net sales and approximately 48% of our operating income.
​
Our Industry
​
According to internal market research, approximately 53% of U.S. households participated in at least one crafting project during 2018, which represented approximately 67 million households. This research indicated that crafting activities continue to enjoy broad based popularity and market size has been stable, valued at approximately $36 billion. We believe the broad, multi-generational appeal, high personal attachment and the low-cost, project-based nature of crafting creates a loyal, resilient following. 
​
Store Expansion and Relocation

​
We believe, based on an internal real estate and market penetration study of Michaels stores, that the combined U.S. and Canadian markets can support between 1,300 and 1,400 Michaels stores. We plan to open approximately 33 Michaels stores, including approximately 10 relocations, in fiscal 2021. We continue to pursue a store relocation program to improve the real estate location quality and performance of our store base. During fiscal 2021, we plan to close up to 15 Michaels stores. Many of our store closings are stores that have reached the end of their lease term. We believe our ongoing store evaluation process results in strong performance across our store base.
​
Our store operating model, which is based on historical store performance, assumes an average store size of approximately 18,000 square feet of selling space. Our fiscal 2020 average initial net investment, which varies by site and 

7




specific store characteristics, was $0.5 million per store, including store build-out costs, pre-opening expenses and average first year inventory.
​
Human Capital
​
As of January 30, 2021, we employed approximately 45,000 team members, including approximately 41,000 who work in the United States with the remaining working in Canada and China. We employ approximately 34,000 team members on a part-time basis. Due to the seasonal nature of the retail business, the number of part-time team members substantially increases during the Holiday selling season. Of our full-time team members, approximately 4,000 are engaged in various executive, operating, administrative functions in our support center, division offices and distribution centers and the remainder are engaged in store operations. None of our team members are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We offer a broad range of company paid benefits to our team members including medical and dental plans, paid vacation, a 401(k) plan, disability insurance, team member assistance programs, life insurance and a team member discount. The level of benefits and eligibility vary depending on the team members’ full-time or part-time status, date of hire, length of service or level of pay. We believe that to succeed as a business we must maintain an inclusive culture that fosters high team member engagement and standards of ethical conduct, provides ongoing development opportunities, and provides a safe working environment. We have taken numerous measures to meet these objectives including providing ongoing learning and mentoring programs, establishing Michaels Resource Groups to raise awareness and promote education of different cultures and lifestyles, and regularly updating and distributing our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics policies to all team members. We also perform ongoing reviews of our safety protocols, including extensive efforts undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure the health and safety of our team members by performing frequent cleanings, ensuring social distancing and providing masks for all of our stores.
​
Competition
​
We are the largest arts and crafts specialty retailer in North America based on store count. The market in which we compete is highly fragmented and includes stores across the U.S. and Canada operated primarily by small, independent retailers along with a few regional and national chains. We believe customers choose where to shop based upon store location, breadth of selection, price, quality of merchandise, availability of product and customer service. We compete with many different types of retailers and classify our competition within the following categories:
​

● | Multi-store chains. This category consists of several multi-store chains, each operating more than 100 stores, including: Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., which operates approximately 930 stores in 47 states and Jo-Ann Stores, Inc., which operates approximately 870 stores in 49 states. We believe these chains are smaller than Michaels with respect to net sales.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Mass merchandisers. This category of retailers typically dedicate a portion of their selling space to a limited selection of home décor, arts and crafts supplies and seasonal merchandise, but they do seek to capitalize on the latest trends by stocking products that are complementary to those trends and their current merchandise offerings. These mass merchandisers generally have limited customer service staffs with minimal experience in crafting projects.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Small, local specialty retailers. This category includes local independent arts and crafts retailers and custom framing shops. Typically, these stores are single-store operations managed by the owner. These stores generally have limited resources for advertising, purchasing and distribution. Many of these stores have established a loyal customer base within a given community and compete based on relationships and customer service.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Internet. This category includes all internet-based retailers that sell arts and crafts merchandise, completed projects and online custom framing. Our internet competition is inclusive of those companies discussed in the categories above, as well as others that may only sell products online. These retailers provide consumers with the ability to search and compare products and prices without having to visit a physical store. These sellers generally offer a wide variety of products but do not offer product expertise or project advice.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
