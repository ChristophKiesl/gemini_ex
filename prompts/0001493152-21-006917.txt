Business Introduction/Summary
 
References herein to “we,” “us,” “Sunworks,” and “the Company” are to Sunworks, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Sunworks United, Inc. (“Sunworks United”), MD Energy, Inc. (“MD Energy”), and Plan B Enterprises, Inc. (“Plan B”).
 
We provide photovoltaic (“PV”) based power systems for the agricultural, commercial, industrial (“ACI”), public works, and residential markets in California, Nevada, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Jersey and Hawaii. We have direct sales and/or operations personnel in California, Massachusetts, and Oregon. Through our operating subsidiaries, we design, arrange financing, integrate, install, and manage systems ranging in size from 2kW (kilowatt) for residential projects to multi MW (megawatt) systems for larger ACI and public works projects. ACI installations have included installations at office buildings, manufacturing plants, warehouses, service stations, churches, and agricultural facilities such as farms, wineries, and dairies. Public works installations have included school districts, local municipalities, federal facilities and higher education institutions. We provide a full range of installation services to our solar energy customers including design, system engineering, procurement, permitting, construction, grid connection, warranty, system monitoring and maintenance.
 
We operate in one segment based upon our organizational structure and the way in which our operations are managed and evaluated. Approximately 74% of our 2020 revenue was from sales to the ACI and public works markets, and approximately 26% of our revenue was from sales to the residential market. Approximately 69% of our 2019 revenue was from sales to the ACI and public works markets, and approximately 31% of our revenue was from sales to the residential market.
 
At the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders on August 7, 2019, the stockholders of the Company approved a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock at a ratio not less than 1-for-3 and not greater than 1-for-10. On August 29, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-7 which went into effect at the open of trading on August 30, 2019. At the effective time of the reverse stock split, every seven shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into one share of issued and outstanding common stock. The authorized shares of 200,000,000 and the par value of $0.001 remained the same. All shares and related financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is retroactively stated to reflect this 1-for-7 reverse stock split.
 
At the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders on August 26, 2020, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to reduce the amount of shares of authorized common stock to 50,000,000. On September 18, 2020, a Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware reducing the number of shares of our authorized common stock to 50,000,000. The par value of $0.001 remained unchanged.

Strategy
 
Our strategy for growth is focused on organic growth through continued expansion in California augmented by growth in other U.S. geographies. We believe that the competitors in the solar industry will consolidate and that we will be able to enhance our growth and scale through accretive acquisitions. With scalable administrative and operational infrastructure, we believe our current approach for organic growth will lead to profitability and positive cash generation. We anticipate taking advantage of the growth in the solar market as well as gaining market share relative to competitors. Additionally, we continue to evaluate various synergistic acquisitions.
 
In our residential business, we are expanding our marketing and internal methods of acquiring customers, which includes collaborating with select third party residential sales companies. We believe that the scarce resource in the residential solar industry is quality, economic installations in which customers can trust. We provide outstanding operations and customer support, as well as a competitive product warranty, which drives demand for our branded installations. We believe this allows us and our sales partners, knowing that they are backed by reliable installation and operations, to sell with confidence.
 
Company Operations
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2019 we had 178 full-time employees. In response to the economic downturn, and the impact of COVID-19 on our business, we reduced our headcount. As of March 30, 2020, we employed approximately 98 full-time employees, 27 part-time employees and 37 employees on temporary layoff. A large percentage of the reductions in work force were intended to be temporary but became permanent as the impact of COVID-19 continued. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 122 full-time employees with 38 of those employees on temporary layoff, medical, family or disability leave plus two part-time employees. We also utilize outside subcontractors to assist with installing solar systems for our commercial and residential customers. Our direct installation labor is a combination of employees and contract labor.
Sales and Marketing
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 16 employees primarily focused on sales, sales support and marketing in California, Massachusetts, and Oregon.
 
We are adding to our in-house direct residential sales force and marketing capabilities while we continue to work with select third-party sales originators. Reducing our residential customer acquisition costs and managing the customer experience throughout the process of sales and installation is part of our goal to reduce our reliance on third-party sales originators. Minimizing the fixed costs and financial risk of maintaining our own direct residential sales force is a priority while improving the entire customer experience.


We have an advantage in the ACI solar market given our extensive contact list, resulting from our experience in the ACI construction market, which provides access to customers. Through our network of vendors, participation in variety of industry trade associations and independent sales consultants, we now have a growing list of repeat clients, as well as an active and loyal referral network.
 
Financing
 
To promote sales, we assist customers in obtaining financing. Our objective is to arrange the most flexible terms that meet the needs and wants of the customer. Although we do not provide financing ourselves, we have relationships to arrange financing with numerous private and public sources.
 
We believe it is best for customers to own their own systems, but some customers prefer not to own their systems. We also have the ability to arrange financing with third parties through Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) and leases for our customers.
 
Suppliers
 
We purchase solar panels, inverters, batteries and materials directly from multiple manufacturers and through distributors. We intend to further coordinate purchases and optimize supply relationships to realize the advantages of greater scale.
 
If one or more of our suppliers fail to meet our anticipated demand, ceases or reduces production due to its financial condition, acquisition by a competitor or otherwise, it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms, and our ability to satisfy this demand may be adversely affected. We do not, however, rely on any single supplier and, we believe, we can obtain needed solar panels and materials from a variety of different suppliers. Accordingly, we believe that the loss of any single supplier would not materially affect our business.

We also utilize strategic partnerships with subcontractors for electrical installations, for racking and solar panel installations, as well as numerous subcontractors for grading, landscaping, and construction for our larger ACI and public works projects.
 
Installation
 
We are a licensed contractor in the markets we serve, and we are responsible for every customer installation. We manage the entire process from permitting through inspection to interconnection to the power grid, thereby making the system installation process simpler and as seamless as possible for our customers. Controlling every aspect of the installation process allows us to minimize costs, ensure quality and deliver high levels of customer satisfaction.
 
Even with controlling every aspect of the installation process, the ability to perform on a contract is subject to limitations. There remain jurisdictional approval processes outside our immediate control including, but not limited to, approval processes required by cities, counties, states or the Federal government or one of their agencies. Other aspects outside of our direct control include approvals from various utility companies and weather conditions.
 
After-Sales Support
 
It is our intent to provide continuing operational and maintenance services for our installed residential and commercial PV systems. We provide extended factory equipment technical support and act as a service liaison using our proprietary knowledge, technology, and solar electric energy engineering staff. We do this through a Limited Workmanship Warranty and Operations and Maintenance Program, which among other things provides a service and technical support line to our customers. We generally respond to our job site related issues within 24 hours and we strive to offer assistance as long as required to maintain customer satisfaction. Our price to customers includes this warranty, which includes the pass through of various manufacturers’ warranties.
 
Facilities
 
We maintain sales and installation offices in Roseville, Rocklin, Durham, Campbell (San Jose), Tulare, and Riverside, California. We lease all our offices and facilities.
 
Customers
 
The majority of our revenue comes from installations in California with a smaller amount in Nevada, Massachusetts, Oregon, Hawaii and New Jersey. Approximately 74% of our revenue in 2020 was in the ACI and public works markets, up from 69% in 2019. Approximately 26% of revenue was generated by residential installations, down from 31% in 2019. We expect that these percentages will vary from year to year.
 
We install systems for the ACI market and for public works projects. We define small commercial and public works projects as the installation of systems under 100kW, whereas large projects involve the installation of systems greater than 100kW. Solar projects have received limited financing from traditional lending sources, but we are encouraged by municipal PACE programs in California which have drawn funding sources such as Ygrene Energy Fund into the financing of energy projects. Public works projects are frequently financed through various PPA arrangements, often in conjunction with SPURR (School Project for Utility Rate Reduction) programs, a Joint Powers Authority in California. Cycle times vary from twenty weeks to more than a year, which is a common cycle for commercial and public works projects. Larger projects typically have a longer cycle time than smaller projects. Agricultural system sizes vary significantly within this sector and can range from 10kW to multiple megawatts. Agricultural loans to farmers and tax-oriented leases are the primary funding sources within the industry. Similar to commercial installations, cycle times for agricultural projects may commonly range from a few months to more than three years depending upon the authority having jurisdiction, the existing utility infrastructure and the various approvals required.
 
Our residential operations address the needs of property owners installing systems typically smaller than 20kW. The typical residential system installed is about 6kW with an average cycle time of 45 days or less. There is an increased demand for systems with batteries, and we fill those customer needs as well. We facilitate purchase or lease financing and offer multiple product options to fit the specific needs of each customer.
 
Competitors
 
In the solar installation market, we compete with companies that offer products similar to ours. Some of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience, and technical capabilities than we do. When bidding for solar installation projects, however, our current experience suggests that there is no clear dominant or preferred competitor in the markets in which we compete. We do not believe that any competitor has more than 10% of the market across all the areas in which we operate. We compete with other solar installers on pricing, service, warranty, and the ability to arrange financing. On a global scale, we also compete, on a cost basis, with traditional utilities that supply electricity to our potential customers and with companies that are not regulated like traditional utilities but that have access to the traditional utility electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure pursuant to state and local pro-competitive and consumer choice policies. Our advantage over traditional utilities is that we offer customers the opportunity to create their own electricity and reduce dependency from the traditional electrical grid.

Seasonality
 
Our revenue is impacted by seasonal weather patterns. In addition, some customers push to complete projects by the end of a calendar year to realize the benefits of available subsidy programs prior to year-end. The first quarter in California often has rain, which also reduces our ability to install and recognize revenues in that quarter relative to the remainder of the year.
Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Generally, the solar installation business is not dependent on intellectual property.
 
Government Regulation and Incentives
 
Government Regulation
 
We are not regulated as a public utility in the United States under applicable national, state or other local regulatory regimes where we conduct business.
 
To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility. Depending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection permission is provided by the local utility and us and/or our customer. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over net energy metering procedures. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection permission is given.
 
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
 
Government Incentives
 
Federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge customers to own or lease our solar energy systems, helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power.
 
The Federal government offered a 30% Investment Tax Credit in 2019. The ITC is currently 26% under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, for the installation of certain solar power facilities until December 31, 2022, after which it will fall to 22% in 2023 and 10% in 2024 and 10% for commercial credit thereafter.
 
The economics of purchasing a solar energy system are also improved by eligibility for accelerated depreciation, also known as the modified accelerated cost recovery system (“MACRS”) depreciation, which allows for the depreciation of equipment according to an accelerated schedule set forth by the Internal Revenue Service. The acceleration of depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that reduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and increases the return on investment.
 
Approximately 50% of states in the U.S. offer a personal and/or corporate investment or production tax credit for solar energy that is additive to the ITC. Further, these states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements, and credits. Many state governments, traditional utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy efficiency measures. Capital costs or “up-front” rebates provide funds to solar customers based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer’s solar energy system. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to a system owner based on the energy generated by their solar energy system during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. Depending on the cost of the system and other site-specific variables, tax incentives can typically cover 30-40% of the cost of a commercial or residential solar system.
 
Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the State from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems, by a specified date.
