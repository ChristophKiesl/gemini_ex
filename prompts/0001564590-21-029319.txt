 History and Significant Events
 Organized in 1963 as Pioneer-Standard Electronics, Inc., an Ohio corporation, we began operations as a distributor of electronic components and, later, enterprise computer solutions. Exiting the former business in fiscal 2003 with the sale of our Industrial Electronic Division, we used the proceeds to reduce debt and fund growth of our enterprise solutions business. This included acquiring businesses focused on higher-margin and more specialized solutions for the hospitality and retail industries. At the same time, we changed our name to Agilysys, Inc.
 In fiscal 2004, we acquired Inter-American Data, Inc., which allowed us to become the leading developer and provider of technology solutions for hotel property management and inventory management in the casino and resort industries.
 In fiscal 2007, we exited the enterprise computer distribution business. We used the proceeds from that sale to return cash to shareholders and fund a number of acquisitions that broadened our solutions and capabilities portfolios. We acquired InfoGenesis, Inc., Visual One Systems Corp. and Eatec Corporation in fiscal 2008, significantly expanding our specialized offerings to the hospitality industry through enterprise-class POS, PMS and inventory and procurement software solutions tailored for a variety of applications in cruise, golf, spa, gaming, lodging, resort and catering. These offerings feature highly intuitive, secure and robust solutions, easily scalable across multiple departments or property locations.
 In fiscal 2012, we sold our IT solutions business and restructured our business model to focus on higher-margin, profitable growth opportunities in the hospitality and retail sectors. We also reduced our real-estate footprint and lowered overhead costs by relocating corporate services from Solon, Ohio to Alpharetta, Georgia, thus moving our senior management team closer to our remaining operating units.
 In fiscal 2014, we sold our retail solutions and services business to Kyrus Solutions, Inc. (Kyrus), an affiliate of Clearlake Capital Group, L.P. Following completion of the transaction, our business focused exclusively on hospitality solutions and the growth opportunities in the hospitality market.
 In fiscal 2018, we opened a software development center in Chennai, India, to supplement our product development efforts.
 Today, we are focused on providing state-of-the-art, end-to-end solutions that enhance guest experiences and allow our customers to promote their brands. We help our customers win the guest recruitment battle and, in turn, grow revenue, reduce costs and increase efficiency. This is accomplished by developing and deploying innovative solutions that increase data speed and accuracy, integrate with other enterprise systems and create a common infrastructure for managing guest data thereby enabling more effective management, intelligent upselling, reduced shrinkage, improved brand recognition and better control of the guest relationship.
 Our strategy is to increase the proportion of revenue we derive from subscription services, cloud applications, ongoing support and maintenance agreements, and professional services.

Products, Support and Professional Services
 We are a leading developer and marketer of software enabled solutions and services to the hospitality industry, including software solutions fully integrated with third party hardware and operating systems; support, maintenance and subscription services; and, professional services. Areas of specialization are point of sale, property management, and a broad range of solutions that support the ecosystem of these core solutions.
 We present revenue and costs of goods sold in three categories:
  
• | Products (hardware and software)
--+---------------------------------


• | Support, maintenance and subscription services
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Professional services
--+----------------------

 Total revenue for these three specific areas is as follows:
 
 
 | Year ended March 31, | 
-----------------------------------------------+----------------------+--------
(In thousands) | 2021 | | 2020 | | | 2019
Products | $ | 26,714 | | $ | 44,230 | | $ | 39,003 
Support, maintenance and subscription services | | 88,565 | | | 83,680 | | | 75,496 
Professional services | | 21,897 | | | 32,847 | | | 26,343 
Total | $ | 137,176 | | $ | 160,757 | | $ | 140,842

Products: Products revenue is comprised of revenue from the sale of software along with third party hardware and operating systems. Software sales include up front revenue for licensing our solutions on a perpetual basis. Software sales are driven by our solutions’ ability to help customers meet the demands of their guests and improve operating efficiencies. Our software revenue is also driven by the ability of our customers to configure our solutions for their specific needs and the robust catalog of integrations we offer to third party solutions. Our software solutions require varying form factors of third party hardware and operating systems to operate, such as staff facing terminals, kiosk solutions, mobile tablets or servers. Third party hardware and operating system revenue is typically driven by new customer wins and existing customer hardware refresh purchases. 
 Support, Maintenance and Subscription Services: Technical software support, software maintenance and software subscription services are a significant portion of our consolidated revenue and typically generate higher profit margins than products revenue. Growth has been driven by a strategic focus on developing and promoting end to end solutions while market demand for innovative new products addressing specific hospitality needs continues to reinforce this trend. Our commitment to exceptional service has enabled us to become a trusted partner with customers who wish to optimize the level of service they provide to their guests and maximize commerce opportunities both on premise and in the cloud.
 Professional Services: We have industry-leading expertise in designing, implementing, integrating and installing customized solutions into both traditional and newly created platforms. For existing enterprises, we seamlessly integrate new systems and for start-ups and fast-growing customers, we become a partner that can manage large-scale rollouts and tight construction schedules. Our extensive experience ranges from staging equipment to phased rollouts as well as training staff to provide operational expertise to help achieve maximum effectiveness and efficiencies in a manner that saves our customers time and money.
 Our portfolio of hospitality software solutions:
 The hospitality industry has long been focused on operating end-to-end businesses, but the technology vendors that service the industry have been focused on product-centric solutions that make use of a high number of software modules and operating silos. To resolve this disconnect and more effectively align with the business operations of our customers, we have evolved our approach to be focused on delivering integrated “platform-centric” solutions for Lodging and Food & Beverage functions, including the applications necessary to support this ecosystem.
 Our technology platform is aimed at transitioning our product and services offerings to better address the needs of hospitality operators as they focus on building better connections with guests before, during and post-visit. We offer an end-to-end solution that helps our customers improve the guest experience, increase top-line performance and reduce operating costs, which leads to opportunities for higher profitability. Our integrated yet modular products allow hospitality operators to recruit and retain customers into their facilities, increase their wallet share from each guest and improve the overall experience throughout the entire guest journey – from the initial customer touch point through post-visit interactions.

Guests are empowered to create their own experiences through ordering from a mobile device or walking up to a self-service kiosk, but also providing for a more traditional experience with staff by interacting with a cashier or bar, or having a server come to them. Irrespective of the channel of interaction for the guest, our POS suite provides a single integrated enterprise grade back office management system with robust reporting capabilities. This allows our customers to manage menus, price changes, purchasing trends, inventory management and sales reporting from a single integrated source providing for increased efficiency as well as providing a richer guest profile.

It supports ordering for multiple guests at a table over the course of a meal using their own devices making the ordering process touchless while freeing up staff to spend more time with guests. The result is dramatically increased revenue opportunities and more chances to enhance guest service.

Agilysys IG Digital Menu Board provides large screen menu and image display on commercial television monitors.

 Virtual Check-in and Check-out Solutions
 Today’s hotels cater to guests with high expectations when it comes to technological efficiency.

To that end, we offer software modules that enable this approach and are fully integrated with our core PMS solutions.

Industry and Markets
 We are a technology software solutions company exclusively focused on the hospitality industry. Our products have been enabling mission-critical core hospitality operations for more than four decades. Our software solutions are required to run the operations of the hospitality business and designed to drive substantial customer benefits through increased revenue, improved operational efficiency, enhanced guest experience and improved employee morale. In addition, many of our solutions enable social distancing capabilities for our customers. Our innovative software solutions described above have been purpose-built to serve the unique needs of the following hospitality sectors: casinos, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, managed foodservice providers, sports and entertainment, and healthcare. We operate across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and India with headquarters located in Alpharetta, GA.
 The sectors we serve are going through unprecedented and uncertain times with the COVID-19 pandemic. As more people receive vaccinations and pandemic-related restrictions begin to ease, we are seeing the initial signs of recovery and re-opening in the markets we serve. Therefore, the long-term outlook remains strong and we expect the momentum from the three years preceding the pandemic to eventually pick back up with a focus on social distancing and mobile applications. Prior to COVID-19, we estimated our total addressable market to be approximately $4.8 billion in annual recurring revenue opportunity. While the size of the opportunity might face pressure in an economic downturn, we feel it is still in the billions of dollars and we are only a fraction of that size. We continue to feel good about our opportunity to win market share given our relative competitive strength in the industry.

Customers
 Our customers include large, medium-sized and boutique hospitality providers, both owned and franchised, as well as divisions or departments of large corporations in the hospitality industry. We concentrate on serving the needs of customers in a range of customer-focused settings where brand differentiation is important and guest recruitment is intense. Our customer base is highly fragmented.
Human Capital
 As of March 31, 2021, we employed approximately 1,350 employees, with approximately 68%, 28%, 3%, and 1% of our employees located in India, the United States, APAC, and EMEA, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and a critical factor in our success.
 Our senior management team is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. We seek employees who share a passion for technology and its ability to improve our customers’ businesses in hospitality. We believe we offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being and foster their growth and development. We offer our employees pay and benefits packages that we believe are competitive with others throughout our industry, as well as within the local markets in which we operate, and align individual performance with our success.
 We encourage our employees to embrace different ideas, strengths, interests and cultural backgrounds. We are committed to providing our employees with an environment free of discrimination, harassment and workplace violence. We make all benefit and employment-related decisions in compliance with established equal employment opportunity statutes and without regard to religion, national origin, age, gender, race, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, citizenship, pregnancy, medical condition or any other protected class status, as defined by local, state or federal laws. All employees, directors, independent contractors, and other parties who work with Agilysys are expected to create a working environment where everyone is respected, regardless of individual differences. Valuing each person’s character, virtues, and individual experiences will leverage our ability to attract and retain quality employees, customers, and suppliers.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. These changes include having most of our employees work from home until the pandemic eases while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work at our customers’ locations. We have taken, and will continue to take, actions in accordance with the applicable local guidance, such as the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, to protect our employees so they can more safely and effectively perform their work.
 Seasonality
 Occasionally, the timing of large one-time orders, such as those associated with significant remarketed product sales around large customer refresh cycles or significant volume rollouts, creates variability in our quarterly results.
Competition
 Our solutions face a highly competitive market. Competition exists with respect to developing and maintaining relationships with customers, pricing for products and solutions, and customer support and service.
 We compete with other full-service providers that sell and service bundled POS and PMS solutions comprised of hardware, software, support and services. These companies, some of which are much larger than we are, include Oracle Corp., Shiji, Amadeus IT Group and Infor. We also compete with smaller software companies like POSitouch, Northwind and Appetize Technologies. In addition, we compete with PMS systems that are designed and maintained in-house by large hotel chains.
 Environmental Matters
 We believe we are compliant in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate that such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to any of our operations.
