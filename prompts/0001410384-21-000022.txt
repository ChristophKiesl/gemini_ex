Item 1. Business.
Overview
Q2 is a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform the ways in which traditional and emerging financial services providers engage with account holders and end users, or End Users. We sell our solutions to financial institutions, alternative finance and leasing companies, or Alt-FIs, and financial technology companies, or FinTechs. Our solutions enable our customers to deliver robust suites of digital banking, lending, leasing, and banking as a service, or BaaS, services that make it possible for End Users to transact and engage anytime, anywhere and on any device. Our solutions are often the most frequent point of engagement between our customers and their End Users. As such, we purpose-build our solutions to deliver compelling and consistent End-User experiences across digital channels and to drive the success of our customers by optimizing their digital brands and enhancing End-User acquisition, retention and engagement.
We have deep domain expertise in developing and delivering secure, advanced digital solutions designed to help our customers compete in the complex and heavily regulated financial services industry. Q2 began by providing digital banking solutions to regional and community financial institutions, or RCFIs, with the mission of empowering them to leverage technology to compete more effectively and to strengthen the communities and End Users they serve. Through investment in innovation and acquisitions, our solutions have grown to include a broader range of services and experiences, including commercial banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending and leasing, BaaS, digital account opening and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management solutions, further serving the needs of financial institutions as well as Alt-FIs and FinTechs. 
The RCFI market includes approximately 10,200 banks and credit unions with less than $100 billion in assets according to data compiled by BauerFinancial as of September 30, 2020. To date, a substantial majority of our revenues continue to come from sales of our digital banking platform, and we continue to be focused on our founding mission of building stronger and more diverse communities by strengthening their financial institutions.
The growth and adoption of digital financial services creates challenges and opportunities in the markets served by financial institutions as well as emerging providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs. The proliferation and ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices and End Users' increasing expectations for digital services have driven increases in the number of providers, greater fragmentation of financial services markets and a broadening set of new and innovative digital services. End Users increasingly expect to transact and engage with financial services providers anytime, anywhere and on any device, and seamlessly across devices. End Users also select digital solutions based on the quality and intuitiveness of the digital user experience.
Financial institutions, Alt-FIs and FinTechs are seeking to address these challenges and opportunities and capture End-User engagement by providing new, innovative digital financial services, solutions and experiences. Traditional financial services providers such as banks and credit unions are experiencing reduced End-User engagement in their physical branches and increased End-User engagement with their digital services and thus, they are increasing their investment in digital services. Emerging providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs are leveraging their digital focus and expertise and capitalizing on increased End-User demand for digital financial services by creating new and expanding existing digital service offerings. The combination of these two drivers of investment by traditional and emerging financial services providers is driving new competition, innovation and unique market opportunities. 
Despite the competition between traditional and emerging financial service providers, the digital solutions offered by emerging financial services providers are often dependent upon core banking functions, creating an interdependency between them. Financial institutions of all sizes provide two fundamental banking functions among others - they hold NCUA-insured or FDIC-insured deposits and they transfer money. Providing these critical banking functions generally requires a federal or state banking charter, as well as specialized expertise and infrastructure, and subjects the provider to complex regulatory oversight by various authorities, which requires financial institutions to implement and maintain complex and costly operating policies, procedures and infrastructure to protect End Users, their deposits and their personal information. As emerging financial services providers explore new digital services offerings, they often utilize the banking services of financial institutions in partnership rather than making the significant investments in expertise and infrastructure necessary to obtain a banking charter and otherwise become regulatory-compliant.
The Alt-FI and FinTech markets consist of thousands of emerging financial services providers all over the world seeking to provide End Users with financial services, experiences and solutions that can be competitive with, but also complimentary to and dependent upon banking. Alt-FIs and FinTechs are typically less constrained than traditional financial services providers by legacy technology solutions, physical branch locations and regulation. Alt-FIs and FinTechs have received substantial investment, estimated to be greater than $250 billion globally from 2008 through 2020, according to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited's, or Deloitte's, web-based Interactive Fintech Funding Report citing Venture Scanner source data. 
We have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since its introduction in 2005. In addition, over the past several years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functions that serve a broader range of needs of financial institutions as well as the needs of Alt-FIs and FinTechs. Our solutions now include a broad range of services and experiences including commercial banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending and leasing, BaaS, digital account opening and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management solutions. We believe our expanded solution offerings and the corresponding growth of our customer base and market opportunity have increased the addressable market for our solutions to greater than $10.0 billion.
Our solutions utilize a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, delivery model, designed to scale with our customers as they grow their business, add End Users on our solutions and expand the breadth of digital services and solutions they offer. On average, Q2 Platform customers have historically grown subscription revenue by approximately 30% within 36 months of implementation. Our SaaS delivery model is also designed to reduce the cost and complexity of implementing, maintaining and enhancing the digital services and solutions our customers provide to their End Users. 
We design and develop our solutions with an open platform approach intended to provide comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems. This integrated approach allows our customers to deliver unified and robust financial experiences across digital channels. Our solutions provide our customers the flexibility to configure their digital services in a manner that is consistent with each customer's specific workflows, processes and controls. Our solutions also allow our customers to personalize the digital experiences they deliver to their End Users by extending their individual services and brand requirements across digital channels. Our solutions and our data center infrastructure and resources are designed to comply with the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions and financial services providers and to safeguard our customers' data and that of their End Users. 
We believe that financial services providers are best served by a broad integrated portfolio of digital solutions that provide rapid, flexible and comprehensive integration with internal and third-party solutions allowing them to provide modern, intuitive digital financial services in a secure, regulatory-compliant manner. We also believe that the breadth and depth of our solution offerings across the financial institution, Alt-FI and FinTech markets, our open and flexible platform approach, our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to a large network of RCFIs, and our expertise in delivering new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions uniquely position us in the market for digital financial services solutions. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 450 installed digital banking platform customers located in 48 states, and those customers had approximately 17.8 million consumer and commercial users registered on our digital banking platform. Registered users of our digital banking platform, or Registered Users, executed over $1.4 trillion in financial transactions on our 
digital banking platform during 2020. Please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsâ€”Key Operating Measures" for additional detail on how we define "Installed Customers" and "Registered Users." 
We primarily sell subscriptions to our solutions through our direct sales organization and recognize the related revenues over the terms of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform agreements averages over five years. Our digital banking platform revenues generally increase as we add new customers, sell additional solutions to existing customers, the number of End Users on our solutions grows and the number of transactions that End Users perform on our solutions increases. The structure and terms of our newer lending and leasing, BaaS and sales enablement and portfolio management solution arrangements are varied, but generally are also sold on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements.
We have achieved significant growth since our inception. We had total revenues of $402.8 million, $315.5 million and $241.1 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, to grow our business by expanding our sales and marketing activities, developing and acquiring new solutions, enhancing our existing solutions and technical infrastructure and scaling our operations. We incurred net losses of $137.6 million, $70.9 million and $35.4 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had total assets of $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.

We are headquartered in Austin, Texas, and our principal executive offices are located at 13785 Research Blvd, Suite 150, Austin, Texas 78750. Our telephone number is (512) 275-0072. 
Industry Background
The financial services market is intensely competitive. The growth and adoption of digital financial services has and continues to create challenges and opportunities for both traditional providers such as financial institutions as well as emerging providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs. 
The proliferation and adoption of mobile and tablet devices and digital services are dramatically changing the financial services market
The proliferation and ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices and End Users' increasing expectations for digital services have driven increases in the number of financial services providers, greater fragmentation of the financial services market and a broadening set of new and innovative digital financial services. End Users increasingly expect to transact and engage with financial services providers anytime, anywhere and on any device, and seamlessly across devices. These changes in the financial services market and in End-User expectations create challenges and opportunities for financial institutions as well as emerging financial services providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs.
Financial institutions, Alt-FIs and FinTechs are seeking to address these challenges and opportunities and capture End-User engagement by providing an ever-broadening set of new and innovative digital financial services, solutions and experiences which better align with End Users' increasingly digital lives, experiences and interactions. These services, experiences and solutions include, among other things, account opening, deposits, investments, payments, money transfers, credit card management and loan applications.
The digital solutions offered by emerging financial services providers are often dependent upon core banking functions, creating an interdependency between emerging and traditional financial services providers. Financial institutions of all sizes provide two fundamental banking functions among others - they hold NCUA-insured or FDIC-insured deposits and they transfer money. Providing these critical banking functions generally requires a federal or state banking charter, as well as specialized expertise and infrastructure, and subjects the provider to complex regulatory oversight by various authorities. As an example, electronic payment transactions in the United States, other than wire transfers, are conducted as automated clearinghouse, or ACH, transactions, which settle through the Federal Reserve System in most cases, and generally, only financial institutions can obtain the necessary master account with a Federal Reserve Bank to settle transactions. These laws and regulations have existed for decades, are extremely burdensome, constantly evolving, and require financial institutions to implement and maintain complex and costly operating policies, procedures and infrastructure to protect End Users, their deposits and their personal information. As emerging financial services providers explore new digital services offerings, they often utilize the banking services of financial institutions in partnership rather than making the significant investments in expertise and infrastructure necessary to obtain a banking charter and otherwise become regulatory-compliant.
Security is paramount for digital financial services
The risks of theft and fraud have always existed in banking and financial services. However, as the adoption, use, and breadth of digital financial services offerings has increased, the incidence of fraud and theft in digital channels has grown substantially. The methods by which criminals seek to commit fraud are constantly changing, requiring financial services providers and their technology providers to continually modify their security protocols. In addition, safeguarding the funds and information of financial service providers and their End Users becomes increasingly complex as digital financial services grow and extend across new channels, devices, and services not previously contemplated.
Digital financial services are highly regulated
Financial services providers and their solutions are subject to extensive and complex regulations and oversight by federal, state and other regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and affect the conduct of financial service providers' operations and, as a result, the business of their technology providers. The compliance of digital financial solutions with these regulatory requirements depends on a variety of factors, including functionality and design, the classification of the financial service provider and its services, and the manner in which the financial service provider and its End Users utilize the solutions. In order to comply with and assist financial service providers in complying with these laws, technology providers to financial service providers may be required to implement operating policies and procedures to protect the privacy and security of their, the financial service providers' and their End Users' information, and to undergo periodic audits and examinations. Maintaining such regulatory compliance becomes increasingly complex as digital financial services grow and extend across new channels, devices, and services not previously contemplated.
Digital financial services are complex and often have limitations
The continued proliferation of mobile and tablet devices and digital solutions offered through open development platforms makes it increasingly difficult to provide a consistent, intuitive and personalized End-User experience and requires digital solutions to support new and rapidly changing mobile operating systems and device types. The technical and operational complexities of delivering integrated digital solutions across multiple operating systems, devices, channels, and complex functionality increase the difficulty of providing a consistent, intuitive and personalized End-User experience. Aging or increasingly complex solutions can create the following challenges for financial services providers:
â€¢integrating applications and systems from multiple vendors may increase costs and time-to-market;
â€¢managing relationships with multiple vendors can be time consuming and require greater management infrastructure;
â€¢building, maintaining and upgrading regulatory-compliant and secure solutions and infrastructure can be expensive and time-consuming and require special expertise that can be hard to find and retain;
â€¢operating, supporting and upgrading systems from multiple vendors can be difficult, costly and less secure and limit the ability to provide a unified End-User experience or comprehensive view of End-User behavior;
â€¢partnering with FinTechs and Alt-FIs and innovating and delivering new solutions can be difficult and cost-prohibitive when integration with dated legacy infrastructure is required; and
â€¢training End Users and internal personnel on the use of different point systems can be challenging, time-consuming and costly.
The use of multiple point solutions for digital financial services can require End Users to maintain different login credentials across digital channels and learn and understand different systems. Additionally, the disjointed nature of the underlying workflows, data and terminology caused by the implementation of multiple solutions can lead to decreased End-User adoption, retention and satisfaction. End Users' adoption, retention and satisfaction can also be adversely impacted by the dated End User interfaces of older legacy systems.
The market for digital financial services is significant
We define RCFIs as federally-insured banks and credit unions with less than $100 billion in assets, which according to data compiled by BauerFinancial as of September 30, 2020, consisted of approximately 10,200 financial institutions with combined assets of $8.3 trillion, representing 36% of assets held by all federally-insured financial institutions. RCFIs have historically sought to differentiate themselves by providing local, personalized banking services that are responsive to the changing needs and circumstances of their communities. Many RCFIs are locally owned and obtain deposits and make lending decisions on a local basis. RCFIs account for a large portion of small business loans, helping local businesses create jobs and drive economic growth in the communities they serve. RCFIs seek to develop strong, lasting relationships with their End Users and can serve as centers of commerce and influence in their communities.
The Alt-FI and FinTech markets consist of thousands of emerging financial services providers all over the world seeking to provide End Users with new and innovative financial services, experiences and solutions that can be competitive with, but also complimentary to and dependent upon banking. Alt-FIs and FinTechs are typically more nimble and development-focused and less constrained than traditional financial services providers are by legacy technology solutions, physical branch locations and regulation. Alt-FIs and FinTechs have received substantial investment, estimated to be greater than $250 billion globally from 2008 through 2020, according to Deloitte's web-based Interactive Fintech Funding Report citing Venture Scanner source data.
 We have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since its introduction in 2005. In addition, over the past three years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functions that serve a broader range of needs of financial institutions as well as the needs of Alt-FIs and FinTechs. Our solutions now include a broad range of services and experiences including commercial banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending and leasing, BaaS, digital account opening and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management solutions. Our expanded solution offerings and the corresponding growth of our customer base and market opportunity have increased our addressable market.
Based on our estimates of the number of target RCFIs for our digital banking solutions and our internal assumptions as to the number and types of digital accounts they serve, the prices for our solutions and the number of transactions processed, we believe that the market for our digital banking solutions, including retail, small business, commercial, digital account opening and Centrix solutions is greater than $5.0 billion. Based on our estimate of the number of target providers of digital lending and leasing services and our internal assumptions as to the number of End Users they serve and the prices for our solutions, we believe that the market for our digital lending and leasing solutions, including the borrower portal, origination, underwriting, servicing, collections, actionable insights, coaching, negotiation, pricing and sales enablement modules, is greater than $4.0 billion. The market for our open application programming interface, or API, solutions for financial services generally, including potential customer segments and product use cases, is relatively new, broad and continually evolving. Based on our estimates of the number of target financial institutions and FinTechs for our BaaS solutions and our internal assumptions as to the number of End Users they serve, the prices for our solutions and the number of transactions processed, we believe the market for our BaaS solutions is greater than $1.0 billion. In the aggregate, we believe that the worldwide market for our solutions is greater than $10.0 billion.
The continued proliferation of mobile and tablet devices and digital solutions offered through open development platforms makes it increasingly difficult to provide a consistent, intuitive and personalized End-User experience and requires digital solutions to support new and rapidly changing mobile operating systems and device types. The technical and operational complexities of delivering secure, regulatory-compliant, integrated digital solutions across multiple operating systems, devices, channels, and complex functionality increases the difficulty of providing a consistent, intuitive and personalized End-User experience. 
We believe that financial services providers are best served by a broad integrated portfolio of digital solutions that provide rapid, flexible and comprehensive integration with internal and third-party systems allowing them to provide modern, intuitive digital financial services in a secure, regulatory-compliant manner. We have deep domain expertise in new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions in the complex and highly-regulated financial services industry and with the technical and operational complexities of delivering integrated financial services solutions across multiple operating systems, devices and channels. As a result, we believe that the breadth and depth of our solution offerings across the financial institution, Alt-FI and FinTech markets, our open and flexible platform approach, our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to a large network of RCFIs, and our expertise in delivering new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions uniquely position us in the market for digital financial services solutions.

Key Benefits
Our solutions provide the following key benefits to our customers and their End Users:
â€¢Intuitive design: We designed from inception the features and End-User experience of our solutions to be optimized for touch-based devices and then extend that design to other digital channels. This design process and our broad feature offerings enable our solutions to deliver a modern, unified End-User experience across digital channels.
â€¢Comprehensive view of End Users: Our digital banking platform provides our RCFI customers with a comprehensive view of End-User access and activity across devices and channels. The insights made possible by a comprehensive view enable an enhanced, personalized End-User experience, real-time risk and fraud assessment and other analytic features that improve the function and security of our solutions.

These integration tools connect with a wide variety of third-party applications, allowing us to seamlessly integrate with our customers' internal and third-party systems such as account services, payments and imaging.
â€¢SaaS delivery model: We developed our solutions to be cloud-based. Our customers subscribe and pay for their use of our solutions over time, and our solutions do not require our customers to install any significant technical infrastructure. While we host our digital banking platform for substantially all of our RCFI customers, our lending, leasing, and BaaS solutions are hosted with industry leading public cloud service providers. Our SaaS delivery model can reduce the total cost of ownership of our customers by providing the development, implementation, integration, maintenance, monitoring and support of our cloud-based solutions on a subscription basis. Our solutions are designed to support the rapid addition of new services as well as the introduction of new devices and digital channels. As a result, our customers can easily scale the use of our solutions with their needs as they add End Users and expand the digital services and solutions they offer.
â€¢Regulatory compliance: Our solutions leverage our deep domain expertise and the significant investments we have made in the design and development of our data center architecture and other technical infrastructure, including public cloud services, to meet the stringent security and technical requirements on financial institutions and financial services providers. Customers who use our cloud-based solutions are able to satisfy security and technical compliance obligations by relying on the security programs and regulatory certification of our data centers and other technical infrastructure. By doing so, our customers avoid the significant cost and effort associated with building, maintaining and upgrading a regulatory-compliant and secure environment on their own.
â€¢Delivery of robust digital financial services across multiple channels: Our solutions enable our customers to deliver robust and integrated digital financial services to their End Users who increasingly expect and appreciate the freedom to transact and engage anytime, anywhere and on any device. Through a single log-in and consistent workflow, End Users are able to seamlessly conduct consumer and commercial transactions across digital channels and devices.
â€¢Improved and more frequent engagement with End Users: The breadth of our solutions and quality of the End-User experience they provide enable our customers to increase the frequency and effectiveness of their interactions with End Users. We believe the frequency and ease of these interactions can strengthen the relationships between End Users and our customers and help our customers better serve their End Users through a more comprehensive understanding of their behavior and activities. We believe that engaging with commercial End Users, in particular, involves unique challenges, and by enabling commercial relationship managers with actionable data-driven insights into commercial End-User relationships, they can better serve their commercial End Users and increase the overall performance of their financial institution.
â€¢Drive End-User loyalty: We believe our customers are able to drive loyalty by increasing their level and quality of End-User engagement. Our customers are able to tailor our solutions by offering individually relevant functionality as well as branded, localized End-User experiences. Our digital banking platform and lending solutions provide our financial institution customers with a comprehensive view of operational and End-User activity across channels and devices allowing them to look for opportunities to improve End-User engagement and grow their End-User relationships with targeted offerings based on specific behavior. We believe this further strengthens End-User loyalty by enabling our customers to engage End Users through customized and End-User-friendly digital experiences.
â€¢More effective marketing of products and services: Our customers' marketing of their new and existing products and services through our solutions can be frequent, timely and targeted. The ease and availability of communications within digital channels also make it easier for End Users to find information about products and services. Our solutions also offer a simplified transaction experience, which can help improve sales of products and services. 
â€¢Real-time security: We employ multi-layered controls to help secure our customers' and End Users' information. Each layer addresses specific areas of possible fraud or data vulnerability. Our customers can use transactional-based controls to reduce fraudulent transactions by allowing them to adjust configurations such as transaction values, payment windows or account suspension. Our digital banking platform customers who leverage our Q2 Sentinel product are able to block suspected fraudulent activity in real-time at the application layer and notify operations staff and End Users of suspect transactions prior to consummation of a transaction. This approach reduces and better manages the security risks in financial services and help protect our customers' reputations. 
Our Business Strengths
Since our inception, our mission has been to help financial institutions compete and strengthen the markets they serve. We are highly committed to this mission, and support it by focusing on designing, developing and acquiring new, innovative digital banking and other financial services solutions to meet transforming End-User expectations. We believe we are well positioned to connect and serve traditional and emerging financial services providers as they transform the ways in which they engage, either independently or in partnership, with End Users globally: 
â€¢Our purpose-built digital banking platform leads the RCFI digital banking market: We built our digital banking platform to address unique challenges that RCFIs face in providing digital banking services. Our digital banking platform was created to support the proliferation of mobile and tablet devices and the speed at which their use has become a common part of daily life. Our digital banking platform reduces the inefficiencies of traditional point-to-point integration strategies and replaces multiple management consoles with a single unified view of the rules, rights and security involved with operating seamlessly across digital channels. Our digital banking solutions enable our RCFI customers to provide a compelling, unified End-User experience to consumer and commercial End Users using a single login anywhere, anytime and on any device. We believe our deep domain experience as a leading provider of digital banking solutions positions us well to provide new, innovative digital banking and other financial services solutions to meet transforming End-User expectations.
â€¢We have acquired and developed solutions to better serve our financial institution customers and a broader set of global financial service providers including Alt-FIs and FinTechs: Over the past few years, we have expanded our portfolio to include offerings such as our end-to-end lending and leasing, BaaS, digital account opening and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management solutions. As the financial services landscape has evolved to become more digitized and open, we have strived to ensure our customers can offer a broader range of digital services to their End Users. 
â€¢We have a proven track record in providing digital solutions to financial services providers: Our founders and management have a track record of successfully delivering technology for financial services providers. We have deep domain expertise in financial services and community banking which we utilize to develop and deliver our solutions and services to our customers. 
â€¢Our sales model is tailored to our different markets: The financial institution market is well defined and allows us to effectively direct our go-to-market strategy for our sales and marketing efforts. Utilizing the deep industry experience of our management and sales teams, we are able to leverage our relationships with leaders and influencers at many of our financial institution customers as valuable sources of reference and promotion. We have also developed actionable insights into our sales and marketing performance, enabling us to be efficient with our go-to-market investments. The Alt-FI and FinTech markets are relatively new, broad and continually evolving. As a result, we utilize third-party partnerships and insights from our experience with financial institution customers to effectively pursue these markets.
â€¢We grow our customer relationships over time: Throughout our long-term customer relationships, we employ a structured strategy designed to inform, educate and enhance customer confidence and help our customers identify and implement additional solutions to benefit and grow their End-User bases. 
â€¢Our revenues are highly predictable: To date, a substantial majority of our revenues continue to result from sales of our digital banking platform to RCFIs. We generally recognize our revenues over the terms of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform customer agreements averages over five years. Our long-term agreements and our high customer retention, as well as the growth over time in the number of End Users using our solutions, drive the recurring nature of our revenues and provide us with significant visibility into future revenues. Furthermore, we believe our customer services model drives high retention rates and incremental sales of our solutions. 
â€¢Our award-winning culture drives innovation and customer success: We believe our award-winning, innovation-focused culture and the location of our operations facilitate recruiting and retaining top development, integration and design talent. We are headquartered in Austin, Texas which is a vibrant city that continues to attract an increasing number of young professionals and has close ties to leading research institutions. In each of the past ten years, the Austin American Statesman recognized us as one of Austin's "Top Places to Work." We believe our mission, combined with our focus on delivering leading-edge digital solutions, enables us to attract and retain top talent.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe we are well positioned to connect and serve traditional and emerging financial services providers as they transform the ways in which they engage, either independently or in partnership, with End Users globally. To accomplish this goal, we are pursuing the following growth strategies:
â€¢Further penetrate our large market opportunity: We believe financial institutions are increasingly adopting cloud-based digital banking solutions. With the ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices and resulting proliferation of mobile digital solutions provided through their open developer platforms, End Users are increasingly engaging with financial institutions, Alt-FIs and FinTechs across a variety of digital channels. Over the past three years, in response to the increasing demand for innovative digital banking and other financial services, we have expanded our addressable market by acquiring and developing solutions that serve the needs of a broader, global set of emerging financial services providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs and their End Users, which also facilitates partnerships with and integration to the digital solutions of our financial institution customers. We intend to further penetrate our large market opportunity and increase our number of financial institution, Alt-FI and FinTech customers using our broad range of digital solutions through acquiring and developing additional solutions, investments in our sales and marketing organization and related activities.
â€¢Grow revenues by expanding our relationships with existing customers: We believe there is significant opportunity to expand our relationships with existing customers by selling additional solutions such as our lending and leasing, digital account opening and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management solutions. In addition, our revenues from existing customers continue to grow as these customers increase the number of End Users on our solutions and as the number of transactions these End Users perform on our solutions increases. We believe our recent investments in digital lending, leasing, BaaS, digital account opening and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management, and other innovative solutions will help our customers expand their relationships with us by allowing them to more efficiently sell and market additional services and solutions to their End Users.
â€¢Continue to expand our solutions offerings and enhance our platform: We believe our history of innovation distinguishes us in the market, and we intend to continue to invest in our software development efforts and introduce new solutions that are largely informed by and aligned with the business objectives of our existing and new customers. For example, in June 2017, we introduced Q2 BaaS (previously known as Q2 Open), a portfolio of open API financial services which are designed to allow RCFIs, Alt-FIs and FinTechs to develop and support their own digital financial services and solutions more quickly and cost-effectively. Q2 BaaS additionally provides an opportunity for our RCFI customers to partner with Alt-FIs and FinTechs in providing innovative digital services and solutions to meet evolving End-User demands. In October 2018, we acquired Cloud Lending Solutions, or Cloud Lending. With the Cloud Lending acquisition, we added to our portfolio of solutions an end-to-end digital lending and leasing platform which allows RCFIs, Alt-FIs and FinTechs to automate and digitize lending and leasing related activities. In November 2018, we acquired Gro Solutions, or Gro. With the Gro acquisition, we added Q2 Gro to our portfolio of solutions, a digital online account opening and sales and marketing platform which enables customers to make personalized recommendations and cross-sell banking products, such as deposit accounts and loans. In October 2019, we acquired Lender Performance Group, LLC, or PrecisionLender. With the PrecisionLender acquisition, we added to our portfolio of solutions PrecisionLender's data-driven sales enablement, pricing and portfolio management platform to support commercial lending for financial institutions globally, as well as AndiÂ®, a digital enterprise coach powered by machine learning.
â€¢Selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments: In addition to continuing to develop our solutions organically, we regularly evaluate strategic opportunities, such as our acquisitions of Centrix, Social Money, Unbill, Cloud Lending, Gro and PrecisionLender. We anticipate that we will continue to selectively pursue acquisitions of and strategic investments in technologies that will strengthen and expand the features and functionality of our solutions and provide access to new customers and new markets.

Implementation and Customer Support 
We seek to deepen and grow our customer relationships by providing consistent, high-quality implementation and customer support services, which we believe drive higher customer retention and incremental sales opportunities within our existing customer base. We structure our implementation teams to effectively collaborate with the management and technology teams of our customers ensuring the rapid deployment and effective utilization of our solutions. Under certain circumstances for our digital lending and leasing solutions, we partner with third-party professional system integrators to support our customers in the installation and configuration process. These implementation teams develop and execute a coordinated implementation plan for our customers centered around five standard phases of IT transformation projects: initiation, configuration, application testing, limited production and production.
Our customer support personnel serve the comprehensive support-related needs of our customers. Due to the highly-regulated and complex nature of the financial services industry, our implementation and customer support service teams, including any third-party professional system integrators with which we partner, must be knowledgeable about our solutions and the regulatory environment in which our customers are required to operate.
Partner Offerings
Our customers are reliant on an ever-growing ecosystem of third-party digital solutions to complement their financial services offerings and we provide a broad range of tools to help our customers efficiently bring them to market. The flexible nature of our solutions, along with an internally developed, highly flexible set of integration tools allows us to build rapid integrations with our customers' internal and third-party systems to support End-User activities and customer processes. These integration tools connect with a wide variety of third-party applications, allowing us to seamlessly integrate with our customers' internal and third-party systems such as account services, payments and imaging. Our ability to integrate with these systems enables our customers to offer a comprehensive set of consumer and commercial functionality to their End Users.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organization is responsible for growing our customer base and maintaining and expanding relationships with our existing customers. We sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales organization but also through partnerships for select solutions and global regions. Our direct sales organization consists of experienced sales professionals who are organized by geography, account size, type of market and whether a prospect is a new or existing customer. Customers are assigned a dedicated representative to provide ongoing assistance in the execution of the customer's digital strategy to meet the needs of its End Users. Our sales representatives are supported by our solutions consulting and sales operations teams.
Our marketing team complements our sales organization through integrated programs for demand creation, pipeline acceleration, customer expansion and brand advocacy. While the financial institution market is well-defined due to the regulatory classification of financial institutions, the Alt-FI and FinTech markets are broader and more difficult to define due to the changing number of providers in each market. We focus our marketing efforts on sponsorships, highly-targeted tradeshows, publications, digital newsletters, digital advertising, account-based marketing, as well as referral agreements with strategic industry partners. Our marketing team also conducts primary research to support our industry thought leadership and to identify emerging trends in End-User behavior and digital activities. Our marketing programs primarily target digital transformation, technology, finance, operations and marketing executives as well as senior business leaders.
Research and Development
Our focus on innovation has fueled our growth and enables us to provide our customers secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform the ways in which traditional and emerging financial service providers engage with End Users. We allocate significant resources to developing and improving our solutions to meet our customers' evolving needs. We monitor and test our solutions regularly, and we maintain a disciplined release process to enhance our existing solutions and introduce new capabilities without interrupting service delivery. We follow state-of-the-art practices in software development and design, including using modern programming languages, data storage systems and other tools. Our multi-tiered architecture enables us to scale, add and modify features quickly in response to changing market dynamics, customer needs and regulatory requirements. Our platform approach supports rapid development and deployment of new features to address evolving market needs. We also enable customers to address their market-specific needs via our extension and integration frameworks, which is a key aspect of our technology strategy. 
Technology and Operations
Due to the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry, our digital banking platform combines both multi-tenant and single instance aspects. This structure is designed to maximize End-User data security and minimize compliance cost and risks. Our solutions utilize a multi-tiered architecture that allows for scalability, operational simplicity, security and disaster recovery. We have also developed an internal operations and analytics platform that aggregates and leverages customer instance and End-User experience captured within our solutions to drive future innovation and scale.
We serve our digital banking platform customers from two secure, third-party, American National Standards Institute Tier 4 data center facilities, one located in Carrollton, Texas and the other located in Austin, Texas. Both data centers are operated by the same third-party provider. Our digital lending and leasing and BaaS solutions are hosted by cloud-based hosting services, including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. We believe that our current data centers have sufficient capacity to meet our anticipated growth for the foreseeable future. Although we utilize a third party to manage our data center facilities for our digital banking platform, we manage the hardware and software on which our digital banking platform operates. We utilize industry standard hardware in resilient configurations to minimize service interruptions, and regularly consider and implement improvements to enhance the resiliency of our services, including our recent improvements to actively distribute services across both data centers. As a result of these improvements, our network infrastructure is fully redundant within each of our data centers, including network teaming to provide network redundancy that includes multiple upstream Internet connections. We have also purchased a private block of IP address space to simplify and expedite our disaster recovery management operations for our digital banking platform customers.
Our digital banking platform has had average uptime in excess of 99.9% since January 2013. We actively monitor our infrastructure 24x7 for any sign of failure, and we seek to take preemptive action to minimize and prevent downtime. Our data centers employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity and security, including redundant power from multiple substations and cooling systems, fire and flood prevention mechanisms, continual security coverage and biometric readers at entry points as well as perimeter boundary security measures. We have also implemented extensive disaster recovery measures and continue to invest in data center and other technical infrastructure.
All End Users are authenticated, authorized and validated before they can access our solutions. End Users must have, at a minimum, a valid user ID and associated password. Many of our customers also employ other authentication methods such as out-of-band one-time password delivery to log on to our solutions and hardware cryptographic tokens to authorize transactions. Our layered security model allows different groups of End Users to have different levels of access to our solutions. Our solutions' vulnerability is tested using internal tools prior to release, and an independent third party performs penetration and vulnerability tests on our solutions periodically.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secrets and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. As of December 31, 2020, we had nine U.S. patent applications pending and four issued U.S. patents, with expiration dates ranging from October 2027 to January 2038. Despite substantial investment in research and development activities, we have not focused on patents and patent applications historically. We license third-party technologies, such as bill pay technologies, that are incorporated into some of our solutions.
The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. It may be possible for other parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our solutions without authorization. Failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could significantly harm our competitive position and operating results.
Operating companies as well as other opportunistic patent and trademark holders, some of whom own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, seek to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses to their intellectual property, including through litigation, or threats of litigation, based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and will likely in the future, receive notices that claim we have misappropriated or misused other parties' intellectual property rights. There may be intellectual property rights held by others, including issued or pending patents and trademarks that cover significant aspects of our solutions. Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management's attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using solutions found to be in violation of another party's rights. We might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing solutions, which could require significant effort and expense and which we may not be able to perform efficiently or at all. If we cannot license the intellectual property at issue or develop non-infringing solutions for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively.
Our Competition
The market for digital solutions for financial services providers is highly competitive. We compete with new and established point solution vendors, core processing vendors, as well as internally developed solutions. We believe that the comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems, combined with our deep industry expertise, reputation for consistent, high-quality customer support, and our unified cloud-based digital banking, digital lending and leasing and BaaS solutions distinguish us from the competition. 
We currently compete with providers of technology and services in the financial services industry, including point system vendors and core processing vendors, as well as systems internally developed by financial services providers. With respect to our digital banking platform, we have a number of point solution competitors, including NCR Corporation, or NCR, nCino, Inc., Alkami Technology, Inc. and Kony, Inc. (acquired by Temenos AG in September 2019) in the online, consumer and small business banking space and Finastra, ACI Worldwide, Inc. and Bottomline Technologies (de), Inc. in the commercial banking space. We also compete with core processing vendors that provide systems and services such as Fiserv, Inc., Jack Henry and Associates, Inc. and Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., or FIS. With respect to our lending and leasing platform, we compete against a number of point system competitors, including Abrigo, Baker Hill Solutions, LLC, Fair Isaac Corporation, nCino, Inc., Finastra, Moody's Analytics, Inc., Brilliance Financial Technology, Oracle Corporation, Temenos AG, and core processing vendors, including FIS and Fiserv. With respect to our BaaS solutions, due to the vast number of potential use cases and customer segments, the list of potential competitors is extremely broad and varied, but includes companies across the retail banking, financial services, transaction processing, consumer technology and financial technology services industries.
Many of our competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, may devote greater resources to the promotion, sale and support of their systems than we can, have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have and have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, many of our competitors expend more funds on research and development. 
Although we compete with point system vendors and core processing vendors, we also partner with some of these vendors for certain data and services utilized in our solutions and receive referrals from them. In addition, certain of our customers have or can obtain the ability to create their own in-house systems, and while many of these systems have difficulties scaling and providing an integrated platform, we still face challenges displacing in-house systems and retaining customers that choose to develop an in-house system.
We believe the principal competitive factors for our solutions in the financial services markets we serve include the following:
â€¢alignment with the missions of our customers;
â€¢ability to provide a single platform for consumer and commercial End Users;
â€¢full-feature functionality across digital channels;
â€¢ability to integrate targeted offers for End Users across digital channels;
â€¢ability to support financial institutions in acquiring deposits with open API technologies;
â€¢SaaS delivery and pricing model; 
â€¢ability to support both internal and external developers to quickly integrate with third-party applications and systems utilizing a software development kit;
â€¢design of the End-User experience, including modern, intuitive and touch-centric features;
â€¢configurability and branding capabilities for customers;
â€¢familiarity of workflows and terminology and feature-on-demand functionality;
â€¢integrated multi-layered security and compliance of solutions with regulatory requirements;
â€¢quality of implementation, integration and support services;
â€¢domain expertise and innovation in financial services technology;
â€¢ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly; and
â€¢rate of development, deployment and enhancement of solutions.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors within the financial institution, Alt-FI and FinTech markets we serve, but we expect competition to continue and increase as existing competitors continue to evolve their offerings and as new companies enter our market. To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing, customer support and our business operations generally.
People
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,751 employees, of which 1,749 are full time employees, 1,520 were employed in the United States, and 231 were employed outside of the United States. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are a party to a collective bargaining agreement.
People are at the center of everything we do. Our mission is to build stronger and more diverse communities by strengthening their financial institutions. Our employees are paramount to our success, and our founders have created a set of principles to help guide us to be ethical and accountable to our customers, partners, communities we serve, each other and other stakeholders in achieving our mission. To ensure our success, we continually endeavor to create and implement employee programs that inspire learning, improve well-being and reward performance. Our current programs focus on the following key human capital measures and objectives:
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
As a global company, we embrace the diversity of our employees, partners, customers, other stakeholders and the communities we collectively serve. We believe that consideration of differing points of view, including unique backgrounds, experiences and talents, is critical to our success. We are building diversity, equity and inclusion into our culture with a focus on creating environments and practices that mitigate bias and allow our employees to be their best. Based on information provided by our employees who opted to self-identify, representing the vast majority of our employees, our employee population as of December 31, 2020 reflected the following:

 | Women | Non-White (1)
Overall | 35% | 26% 
Director-level employees and above | 23% | 17% 

___________________________________________________________________________
(1)Excludes the impact of our Bangalore, India operations.
Our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts highlight:
â€¢promoting an equal opportunity work environment that enables employees to feel safe to express their ideas and perspectives and where they feel they belong;
â€¢educating employees and leaders to recognize where bias exists and building practices to combat its impact;
â€¢recruiting, developing and retaining diverse top talent; and
â€¢reinforcing our commitment by supporting external community-based diversity and inclusion-focused causes and organizations.
In fiscal 2020, we created and launched a diversity-focused council of 11 employees of color, sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer, to help guide us in implementing a more comprehensive diversity and inclusion strategy. Key to this strategy, in 2021 we plan to hire our first full-time leader of diversity, equity and inclusion. We are also investing in a more robust procurement and vendor management function to better promote diversity within our suppliers and partners and are adding a role that will focus on improving diversity in our employee recruiting pipeline and results. Externally, we are partnering with Austin's African American Leadership Institute development program in their mission to enhance civic awareness and leadership opportunities to make an innovative community impact on Central Texas.
Employee Engagement and Culture
Since our inception, our culture has been rooted in our mission to build stronger and more diverse communities by strengthening the financial institutions that serve them. We believe our passion, dedication and commitment towards this mission is a significant differentiator for us with our customers and employees. Our culture is demonstrated and shared through our employee traditions and customs and daily engagements among our employees and with our customers. We live our essential mission of supporting communities through active community support with volunteerism and financial support. We partner with local non-profits that align to our employees' passions with hands-on and virtual volunteering, providing care and impact to communities across the globe. Additionally, we use technology and online tools, such as YourCause, to help promote volunteer opportunities for individual employees and teams. We reward our employees for their service with donation dollars to share back with non-profits of their choice. 
Listening to our employees is a core component to our employee engagement strategy. Being able to understand the needs, preferences and general feedback of our Q2 employees is critical to the design of our People programs. We gather these insights through frequent pulse-style surveys on a range of topics as well as an annual world-wide employee engagement survey conducted by an external vendor. Each year, our leadership team considers the feedback from our employee engagement surveys, both positive and constructive, and focuses on making employee-suggested changes to become an even better place to work. 
We are proud to have been recognized as a highlighted employer through the Austin American-Stateman's "Top Places to Work" for the past ten years based upon our employees' satisfaction ratings. Our Charlotte, North Carolina operations have received similar recognition as a "Best Place to Work" by the Charlotte Business Journal for the last six years.
 Our culture is visible across our organization and highlighted through a host of initiatives, programs and committees including the following:
â€¢our portfolio of company-wide events and forums that foster connections to the organization and one another;
â€¢our employee volunteer committees focused on culture, wellness, and charitable causes help create opportunities for employees to support causes to make a difference in the workplace and local communities; 
â€¢our workspaces and virtual workspace resources that reinforce our mission and guiding principles and promote a collaborative, high-energy work environment that helps facilitate team-based problem solving and cross-departmental learning; and 
â€¢our new-hire employee orientations that help new employees understand our business, culture, mission and values.
To create a culture of teamwork and rewards, we support a range of recognition programs. One of our most utilized programs is a points-based rewards system that allows our employees to highlight successes and give thanks to individuals and teams across the organization. We encourage the engagement of peer-to-peer recognition and showcase our wins, while we utilize Q2's guiding principles as a framework to recognize the behaviors we expect our employees to model. We provide other meaningful opportunities for recognition that emphasize our commitments to each other and our customers, including our Circle of Awesomeness recognition program which awards our outstanding sales and non-sales employees based on employee and customer nominations with sizable awards, which have included company-paid group vacations and team events among other items. In January 2021, we also announced our agreement with Austin FC, Austin's new Major League Soccer team, to be the exclusive naming rights partner for their home stadium in Austin, now called Q2 Stadium. Our agreement with Austin FC will enhance our brand within Austin and globally and enable a variety of unique and exciting opportunities for us to engage our employees, customers, partners and communities.
Learning and Development
We recognize the importance of employees developing and progressing in their careers, starting on their first day with our robust new-hire employee orientation and thoughtful onboarding plans, which are designed to give employees a successful beginning of their Q2 careers. Once employees are onboarded, we then look at the ways in which their skills and careers can further develop at Q2. We provide a variety of resources to help our employees grow in their current roles and build new skills, including a wide variety of development resources and courses through on-demand as well as facilitated learning opportunities. We emphasize individual and team development planning as part of our annual goal-setting process. We believe leading our employees is one of the greatest acts of trust we can provide, and accordingly all managers go through training to enable them to effectively perform as leaders. We offer leadership development resources and programs for all leaders at all experience levels, have created leadership competencies based on our guiding principles to help frame our leadership development programs and continue to build tools to continually advance leaders' capabilities to develop and scale their teams. Globally, we are invested in higher education through internship programs that target colleges and universities. We annually host dozens of interns across various of our geographies with immersive training and on-the-job learning opportunities across a broad set of functions. 
Talent Acquisition
We work diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with world-class universities, including historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, professional associations and industry groups to proactively attract talent. We have a strong employee value proposition that leverages our unique mission-driven culture, collaborative working environment and exciting growth opportunity to attract talent. We leverage multiple resources specifically targeting diversity of candidates in our recruiting pipeline, and we are making investments to help us reduce or mitigate any unconscious bias that exists in the recruiting process. We continue to focus on talent development to broaden and enable our recruiting and leadership teams to advise and deploy even more inclusive recruitment practices.
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation programs are designed to provide a compensation package that will attract, retain, motivate and reward superior employees who must operate in a fast paced, highly-competitive, and technologically-challenging environment. We seek to do this by linking annual changes in compensation to overall Company performance, as well as each individual's contribution to the results achieved. The emphasis on overall Company performance is intended to align the employee's financial interests with the interests of our stockholders, particularly as it relates to our long-term incentive plans. We are committed to fair pay and strive to be externally competitive while ensuring internal equity across our organization, considering roles, relative experience and performance. We conduct global pay equity assessments and compensation reviews, and we are actively working to reduce unconscious bias in our hiring practices, performance reviews and promotion opportunities that may contribute to pay inequities. 
We are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options, and it is our intention to offer benefits that will allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples of our wide-ranging global benefits offered are: 401(k) retirement plan and pension plans, including employer contributions; medical insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental insurance, vision insurance, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, legal insurance and pet insurance. 
Employee Well-Being
We are committed to the health, safety and well-being of our employees. In addition to traditional employee benefits, we offer a number of innovative benefits to support the physical, mental and financial health of our employees. These include, among many other things: onsite and virtual wellness clinics and classes; online tools that assist employees with their physical and mental health; and special events with outside vendors and participants focusing on employee well-being. We also provide global access to an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) providing our employees and anyone living in their household with access to a variety of resources, including mental health and counseling, work life balance and online legal resources. 
COVID-19 Measures
Since March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic nearly all of our employees have worked remotely from home. With this transition we began providing a variety of additional resources and benefits to help our employees effectively navigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as it relates to their physical, financial and mental well-being, as well as their productivity. The primary goal of these additional measures has been to create an environment where our employees feel safe and secure and are allowed the grace and flexibility to adapt to the new demands brought about by this pandemic experience. We have provided opportunities for more flexible work schedules, which has helped employees manage the challenges of unplanned at-home childcare and virtual schooling and conflicting at-home work schedules of other household members. We implemented a COVID day off program creating multiple extra global holidays for employees, affording them extra time to attend to personal matters. Additionally, we offered monthly financial stipends to all employees globally to assist them and their households with the extra expenses of at-home work, education and well-being. We also launched the Q2@home employer-paid benefit to enhance our employees' at-home work experience, providing them with a selection of ergonomic office furniture. We have implemented a number of other benefits and cultural enhancements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including: 
â€¢employer-paid access to virtual meditation resources;
â€¢employer-paid telehealth for eligible U.S. employees;
â€¢increased flexibility for employees to change contributions to flexible spending accounts;
â€¢elimination of deductibles for COVID-related benefits claims for eligible U.S. employees;
â€¢increased COVID-related health coverage for certain eligible non-U.S. employees;
â€¢new virtual physical therapy benefit for eligible U.S. employees; and 
â€¢increased variety and amount of virtual culture events ranging from exercise classes, cooking classes, book clubs, musical performances, DJ dance parties, to coffees and cocktails with senior leaders.
