​
General
​
Glu Mobile develops, publishes, and markets a portfolio of free-to-play mobile games designed to appeal to a broad cross section of users who download and make purchases within our games through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, such as the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and others (“Digital Storefronts”). Free-to-play games are games that a player can download and play for free, but which allow players to access a variety of additional content and features for a fee and to engage with various advertisements and offers that generate revenue for us. We have a portfolio of compelling games based on our own intellectual property such as Cooking Dash, Covet Fashion, Deer Hunter, Design Home, and Diner DASH Adventures, as well as games based on or significantly incorporating third party licensed brands including Disney Sorcerer’s Arena, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, the MLB Tap Sports Baseball franchises and Restaurant Dash with Gordon Ramsay. We are headquartered in San Francisco, California, with other U.S. offices in Foster City, California, Orlando, Florida and international locations in Toronto, Canada and Hyderabad, India.
​
We were incorporated in Nevada in May 2001 as Cyent Studios, Inc. and changed our name to Sorrent, Inc. later that year. In November 2001, we incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary in California, and, in December 2001, we merged the Nevada corporation into this California subsidiary to form Sorrent, Inc., a California corporation. In May 2005, we changed our name to Glu Mobile Inc. In November 2006, Glu Mobile Inc. reincorporated in the state of Delaware. In March 2007, we completed our initial public offering and our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLUU.” Except where the context requires otherwise, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to “Company,” “Glu,” “Glu Mobile,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Glu Mobile Inc., and where appropriate, its subsidiaries. 
​
On February 8, 2021, we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Electronic Arts Inc. (“Electronic Arts”) pursuant to which Electronic Arts has agreed to acquire us for $12.50 in cash for each share of our common stock issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing of the transaction (the “Merger”). This represents approximately $2.1 billion in enterprise value. Pursuant to the terms of, and subject to the conditions specified in, the Merger Agreement, we will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Electronic Arts. The transaction is anticipated to close in the quarter ending June 30, 2021, subject to approval by our stockholders, the receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

Strategy and Business Developments
​
Our Strategy
​
Our goal is to become the leading developer and publisher of free-to-play mobile games. Our strategy for achieving this goal is comprised of three parts:
​

● | Building Growth Games and Maximizing the Value of Catalog Games;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Attracting and Fostering Creative Leaders, Including Potentially by Selective Acquisitions; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Cultivating Highly Creative Environments.
--+------------------------------------------

​
Building Growth Games and Maximizing the Value of Catalog Games 
​
The first prong of our strategy is to build growth games for smartphones and tablets as well as maximize the value we derive from our catalog games. Growth games are titles that we continue to update with additional content and features and which we expect to grow revenue year over year. We believe a key component of driving annual revenue growth from a growth game is the inclusion of community features which may involve users competing with each other, forming clubs or groups to cooperate in completing goals, or contributing their own original content to the game, as well as other live operations efforts such as running regular in-game events, offering virtual currency or item discounts and optimizing our merchandising strategies. Covet Fashion, Design Home and MLB Tap Sports Baseball are our existing growth games. We currently publish titles primarily in four genres: lifestyle, casual, role playing games (“RPGs”), and sports and outdoors. We believe these are genres in which we have already established a leadership position, are otherwise aligned with our strengths or are conducive to the establishment of a strong growth game. 
​
We continue to update some of our catalog titles with additional content and features, whereas on others we expend little to no investment in terms of updates and enhancements. Catalog games differ from growth games in that our focus is to reduce and potentially reverse their year over year revenue declines; to the extent that we succeed in our efforts to grow annual revenue from a catalog game and expect such title’s revenue to continue to grow on an annual basis, we would then consider such catalog game to be a growth game. Cooking Dash, Deer Hunter 2018, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and Restaurant Dash with Gordon Ramsay are examples of our existing catalog games.
​
While we have generally designed our games to incorporate social features that enhance the user’s gameplay experience, as part of our product strategy we are emphasizing adding new social and community-based features, systems, and modes into our growth games. For example, Covet Fashion allows users to join “Fashion Houses” with other users and then borrow each other’s clothes, receive advice on their looks, chat and work together to unlock additional rewards in special style challenges, and our Tap Sports Baseball franchise allows players to challenge their friends to head-to-head matchups and to join clubs that compete in daily events against other clubs as well as includes an improved media-driven chat system. We intend to continue to innovate to further enhance the user experience in our growth games and potentially broaden their audience. For example, we introduced e-commerce functionality to Design Home during 2020, which is intended to deepen the engagement level of our players with the game. In addition, we are exploring making available browser-enabled versions of Tap Sports Baseball and Design Home. 
​
We continue to emphasize developing new titles based on original intellectual property. Reflecting this strategy, revenue from games based on our own intellectual property represented 63.8% of our total revenue in 2020. In addition, 

4



each of the games that we intend to launch worldwide in 2021 will be based on original intellectual property. However, we also seek to selectively license and utilize key brands within our titles if we believe this will maximize their consumer appeal and revenue potential. For example, in March 2020 we launched worldwide Disney Sorcerer’s Arena, our game that features characters from the Disney and Pixar universes, in collaboration with Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media. We also closely work with our celebrity and brand licensors to engage their social media audiences and build games that will resonate with their unique fan bases. In particular, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood utilizes transmedia storytelling, leveraging Ms. Kardashian West’s built-in social media fan base to drive installs and awareness of the game, and then attempts to surprise and delight those fans with real-world events and other game content based on her life. Our goal is for the game content to become entwined with Ms. Kardashian West’s persona and social media presence, and to otherwise enhance interaction with her fans.  We also leverage the strength of well-known brands and licensors to provide users with more realistic experiences, such as the case with MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2020 which features all Major League Baseball, or MLB, clubs and uniforms, all 30 real major league stadiums, and current and former MLB players; we intend to continue evaluating ways to enhance the authenticity of this franchise. We also work to build and nurture social communities in and around the games themselves, creating a new vehicle for strong, personal engagement with the brand or celebrity’s fan base. Continuing to drive installs and awareness of our games through our licensing efforts requires that we continue to partner with brands, celebrities and social influencers that resonate with potential players of our games. Partnering with desirable licensing partners and renewing our existing licenses with our most successful partners requires that we continue to develop successful games based on licensed content and are able to compete with other mobile gaming companies on financial and other terms in signing such partners. We also plan to continue introducing third-party licensed brands, properties and personalities into our games as additional licensed content, for cameo appearances or for limited time events in order to drive awareness and monetization.
​
For us to continue driving installs and awareness of our games and to improve monetization and retention of our players, we must ensure that each of our games has compelling gameplay and a deep meta game that motivates users to continue to play our games for months or even years.  In addition, we must regularly update our games with compelling new content, deliver socio-competitive features like tournaments, contests, player-versus-player gameplay and live events, and build and nurture communities around our franchises both in-game and holistically via community features such as dedicated social channels. Furthermore, we are working on optimizing our user acquisition campaigns. We have also made significant investments in our proprietary analytics and central technology infrastructure.  With our enhanced analytics capabilities, we intend to devote resources towards segmenting and learning more about the players of each of our franchises and further monetizing our highest spending and most engaged players.  We aim to connect our analytics and revenue central infrastructure to multiple elements of our business – from marketing to merchandising – in order to improve player retention and monetization.
​
We also plan to continue monitoring the successful aspects of our games to drive downloads and enhance monetization and retention as part of our product strategy, whether by optimizing advertising revenue within each title, securing additional compelling licensing arrangements, building enhanced and more complex core gameplay, adding deep meta game features or through enhancing our live operation. Optimizing advertising revenue within our games requires us to continue taking advantage of positive trends in the mobile advertising space, particularly as brands continue to migrate budgets from web to mobile.  
​
Attracting and Fostering Creative Leaders, Including Potentially by Selective Acquisitions
​
The second prong of our strategy is to attract, cultivate and retain proven creative leaders who will develop and update our growth and catalog games. Each creative leader is responsible for the long-term planning of his or her titles and to identify and invest in long-term opportunities and concepts that have the potential to become growth games. Our talent model is to attract the industry’s finest and provide them with world-class infrastructure, tools, funding and the support to create hit games. We have made, and plan to make, significant investment in our creative leaders. 
​
We have worked with our creative leaders to instill financial discipline and operational excellence in our organization by revamping our prototyping and greenlight processes. Prior to developing a new game, a creative leader works with a small team to rapidly prototype new ideas that have the potential to become growth games. We expect our creative leaders to fail fast and to either continue to iterate on a game concept or to move on to rapidly prototyping a new 

5



concept. Once the creative leader and his or her team have sufficiently iterated on their concept and are satisfied that their game has the potential to be a growth game, the creative leader will submit a playable version of the game for greenlighting. If the game is greenlit, we then commit larger investments in terms of headcount and resources.
In addition, we have recently invested significant resources evaluating the potential acquisition of companies and individual game teams in order to complement our existing portfolio and augment our roster of creative leaders, and we might pursue selective acquisitions in the future.
​
Cultivating Highly Creative Environments
​
We believe a key part of building growth games and attracting and cultivating creative leaders is providing them with highly creative environments that are optimal for creating hit games. In December 2017, we moved into our current headquarters in San Francisco that were designed to foster collaboration among our game teams and focus the company around our core values and creative-led vision. Creative environments that support our creative leaders and other game development personnel are also needed to attract the level of talent that will support our growth and catalog games. We not only consolidated our studio footprint by moving into our creative center in San Francisco and relocating our Burlingame studio to our San Francisco headquarters, but have also significantly increased our investment in our low-cost, scaled center in Hyderabad, India which provides live operations for some of our catalog games, insourced art, quality assurance and low cost repeatable sales, marketing and general and administrative functions. As part of this consolidation, in the last several years, we closed or sold development studios in Beijing, China; Bellevue, Washington; Portland, Oregon; San Mateo and Long Beach, California; and Moscow, Russia. 
​
Business Developments
​
Since January 1, 2020, we have taken the following actions to support our business:

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2.5 million daily active users and 11.2 million monthly active users of our games on our primary distribution platforms, including Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2.1 billion cumulative installs of our games on our primary distribution platforms, including approximately 13.6 million installs during the fourth quarter of 2020.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | We grew revenue on an annual basis from each of our growth games, as follows:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Revenue from our Tap Sports Baseball franchise increased from $86.2 million in 2019 to $96.1 million in 2020.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In March 2020, the title Disney Sorcerer’s Arena was launched worldwide, which includes characters from the Disney and Pixar universes. Revenue from this title totaled $42.0 million in 2020.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | In April 2020, we extended the term of our license agreement with Ms. Kardashian West for an additional 3.5 years through the end of 2023. Revenue from our Kim Kardashian Hollywood title increased from $25.7 million in 2019 to $50.5 million in 2020.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In June 2020, we completed a follow-on public offering of 17.3 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.25 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds from the offering, were approximately $159.6 million.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In September 2020, we launched Design Home Inspired, a new mobile e-commerce store available within Design Home.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Across the globe our industry is experiencing a continuing trend in which hit games generally remain higher in the top grossing charts for longer. We believe this is due to the continued specialization and investment of teams and companies in their hit titles, and the live, social nature of certain games. Our strategy and the measures we have implemented to support our business position us to take advantage of these trends, as evidenced by the continued strength and year-over-year growth of our Design Home and Covet Fashion titles and the Tap Sports Baseball franchise. We plan to continue to regularly update and otherwise support our growth games in order to ensure that those games monetize and retain users for even longer periods of time. In addition, we plan to continue to invest in our creative leaders and the creative environments in which they and their teams work to increase our likelihood of creating significant hit growth games.
 ​

The MLB Tap Sports franchise was our second largest revenue contributor and the highest ranked baseball title in the Apple App Store’s U.S. iPhone top grossing games rankings during 2020. We expect to launch MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2021 in March 2021 in more than 100 territories with significant new features, including a new event mode and World Ranking Season.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that our games consistently have high production values, are visually appealing and have engaging core gameplay. These characteristics have typically helped to drive installs and awareness of our games and resulted in highly positive consumer reviews. The majority of our games have been featured on the Apple and Google storefronts when they were commercially released, which we believe is the result of us being a good partner of Apple and Google. 
We have continued to improve monetization in our games, with our most popular games remaining successful for longer periods of time. The longevity of our most successful games derives from strong core gameplay, deep meta game features, regular content updates and social and community features, such as the ability to join clans or clubs, tournaments, player-versus-player gameplay and live events. 
Our Revenue
​
We generate the majority of our revenue through in-application purchases (“in-app-purchases”), with the balance 

8



of our revenue primarily generated by offers and in-game advertising. When we incorporate licensed content into our games, we often share a portion of our revenue with the licensors featured in these titles. 
​
In-App Purchases
​
Although users can download and play our games free of charge, they can purchase virtual currency, virtual items, other virtual benefits like time and energy or subscriptions to receive any of these benefits, to enhance their gameplay experience – we refer to these as “in-app purchases” or “micro-transactions.” Some of the benefits that players receive from their in-app purchases include:

● | Play Longer Through Better Equipment – We generally design our games to become significantly more challenging as the player advances through the game. For example, for a game like Diner DASH Adventures, players can purchase higher-quality ingredients and various boosts that can help them complete increasingly difficult levels more easily. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Play Longer Through Energy Replenishment – We design some of our games, such as Deer Hunter 2018 and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, to have short playing sessions, the duration of which are limited by the energy available for each session. Players of Deer Hunter 2018 and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood can use their virtual currency to purchase items that will replenish their energy and enable them to extend their gameplay session. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accelerate Game Progress – Although some players are content to slowly “grind” their way through progressing in a game, others are willing to purchase items to accelerate their progression. For example, our Tap Sports Baseball titles enable players to spend their virtual currency to upgrade their roster of players and boost the effectiveness of such players, thus allowing the player to more quickly assemble a winning team. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customization – Our games generally enable players to express themselves by customizing their character, the world the character inhabits or a room. For example, Covet Fashion and Design Home each allow users to customize the look of their avatar or room, respectively, by purchasing clothing or home design elements. While in Covet Fashion users own a clothing or accessory item indefinitely after it is purchased and can use it in multiple events, Design Home limits the player to five uses of any purchased design element. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
We sell virtual currency to consumers at various prices ranging from $0.99 to $299.99 depending on the available storefront pricing (adjusted for local currencies for sales to players in foreign countries) with the significant majority of player purchases occurring at the lower price points. The Digital Storefronts generally share with us 70% of the consumers’ payments for in-app purchases; we do not have any special agreement or arrangement with respect to pricing or terms with any of the Digital Storefronts. Consumers may also acquire virtual currency, other virtual items or virtual benefits through gameplay or by completing offers, as described below.
​
Offers and In-Game Advertising
​
In addition to in-app purchases of virtual currency, we also monetize our games through offers and in-game advertising. Optimizing advertising revenue within our games requires us to continue taking advantage of positive trends in the mobile advertising industry, particularly as brands continue to migrate budgets from web to mobile. Offers enable users to acquire virtual currency without paying cash but by instead taking specified actions, such as downloading another application, watching a short video, subscribing to a service or completing a survey. We work with third parties to provide these offers to players of our games, and we receive a payment from the third party offer provider based on consumer response to these offers. We also work with third party advertising aggregators who embed advertising, such as incented video ads, ads appearing within the game between content transitions and as pop-up ads; the aggregators typically pay us based on the number of impressions, which is the number of times an advertisement is shown to a player, or conversions, which is the number of times players complete an advertiser’s desired action. In addition, from time to time we work directly with other application developers to include advertising for their applications in our games, and the developers pay us based on either the number of impressions in our games or the number of users who download the developer’s application.
​
Licensed Content

9



​
Following the success of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and games incorporating licensed third-party brands and properties, like our Tap Sports Baseball franchise, we increased our licensing efforts, both in terms of securing licenses to develop games based upon or significantly featuring celebrities and other third-party intellectual property and for cameo appearances or to otherwise incorporate third-party intellectual property into our games. However, we have more recently begun to emphasize developing new titles based on original intellectual property. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, games based on our own intellectual property accounted for approximately 63.8%, 69.9%, and 65.7%, of our revenue, respectively. The decrease in the percentage of revenue derived from original intellectual property from 2019 to 2020 was due primarily to the successful worldwide launch of Disney Sorcerer’s Arena in March 2020 and increased revenue from the Tap Sports Baseball franchise and Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, partially offset by growth in our annual revenue generated by Design Home, Covet Fashion, and Diner DASH Adventures, as well as the continued strength of some of our catalog games. We expect to launch at least four new titles in 2021, including the next iteration of our Deer Hunter franchise, Table & Taste, Tap Sports Fishing and our Crowdstar Moments suite of hypercasual games, each of which will be based on original intellectual property. We also intend to continue to selectively license and utilize key brands within our titles if we believe this will maximize their consumer appeal and revenue potential.
 ​
For games based on or significantly incorporating licensed brands, properties or other content, we share a portion of our revenue with the respective licensors. The average royalty rate that we paid on games based on licensed content (such as Disney Sorcerer’s Arena, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and Restaurant Dash with Gordon Ramsay) or significantly incorporating licensed content (such as MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2020) was approximately 18.5% of gross revenue in 2020, 20.5% in 2019, and 20.2% in 2018. However, the individual royalty rates that we pay can be meaningfully above or below the average based on a variety of factors, such as the strength of the licensed brand, our development and porting obligations, and the platforms on which we are permitted to distribute the licensed content.
​
​
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
​
We market, sell, and distribute our games primarily through direct-to-consumer Digital Storefronts, such as Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.  In addition to publishing our smartphone games on direct-to-consumer Digital Storefronts, we also publish some of our titles on other platforms, such as the Mac App Store and Facebook. In addition, we are exploring the extension of Tap Sports Baseball and Design Home to the PC web browser. The significant majority of our smartphone revenue has historically been derived from Apple’s iOS platform, which accounted for approximately 61.5%, 60.8%, and 63.1% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We generated the majority of these iOS-related revenue from the Apple App Store, which represented 56.2%, 54.4%, and 54.7% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, with the significant majority of such revenue derived from in-app purchases. We generated the balance of our iOS-related revenue from offers and advertisements in games distributed on the Apple App Store. In addition, we generated approximately 38.4%, 39.1%, and 36.6% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, from the Android platform. We generated the majority of our Android-related revenue through the Google Play Store, which represented 32.9%, 33.5%, and 31.3% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We generated the balance of our Android-related revenue from other platforms that distribute apps for devices that run the Android operating system (e.g., the Amazon Appstore) and through offers and advertisements in games distributed through other Android platforms. No other customer or Digital Storefront accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019, and 2018.
​
As part of our efforts to successfully market our games on the direct-to-consumer Digital Storefronts, we attempt to educate the storefront owners about our title roadmap and seek to have our games featured or otherwise prominently placed within the storefront. We believe that the featuring or prominent placement of our games facilitates organic user discovery and is likely to result in our games achieving a greater degree of commercial success. We believe that a number of factors may influence the featuring or placement of a game, including:
​

● | the perceived attractiveness and quality of the title, brand, or licensed intellectual property;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | the level of critical or commercial success of the game or of other games previously introduced by a publisher;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10



​

● | incorporation of the storefront owner’s latest technology in the publisher’s title;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | how strong the consumer experience is on all of the devices that discover titles using any given Digital Storefront;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the publisher’s relationship with the applicable storefront owner and future pipeline of quality titles for it; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the current market share of the publisher.
--+-------------------------------------------

​
The majority of our games have been featured on the Apple and Google storefronts when they were commercially released, which we believe is in part due to our efforts to be a consistently good partner with Apple and Google. In addition to our efforts to secure prominent featuring or placement for our games, we have also undertaken a number of marketing initiatives designed to acquire players and increase downloads of our games and increase sales of virtual currency, including:
​

● | using social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to build a base of fans and followers to whom we can quickly and easily provide information about our games;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | paying third parties, including advertising networks, social media channels and social influencers, to advertise or incentivize consumers to download our games through offers or recommendations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | using “push” notifications to alert users of sales on virtual currency or items in our games; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cross-promoting our games through advertisements in our other games, as well as advertising our games in our competitors’ games;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In addition, certain of our games featuring celebrities or other licensed content like Kim Kardashian: Hollywood generate significant attention through word of mouth, particularly through social media channels. We look to leverage existing social media presences in order to increase the virality and commercial success of our games. Furthermore, social-based methods for promoting our games include in-game events where players compete with and against each other, in-game social promotions and regular content updates, including in-game content that leverages real world events, such as holiday promotions or current events in the life of our celebrity partners.  ​
We have sought to deepen player engagement by fostering a sense of community in our games. As part of these efforts, we have organized player councils for certain of our games where we have invited some of our most dedicated players to special events to engage with the development teams and share their feedback about our games. For example, in 2020 we hosted nine virtual events, where hundreds of Covet players from all over the world participated in virtual chats with Covet designers, created content for the game, and celebrated Covet season launches,– bringing the best aspects of Covet to life, including creativity, fashion, and community. 
​
Development Studios
Our creative leaders have primary responsibility for overseeing game development for our growth and catalog games. The internal studios that develop our games are located in San Francisco and Foster City, California; Orlando, Florida and Toronto, Canada. In addition, we run live operations and produce content updates for some of our catalog games from our Hyderabad, India location.
Our studios are generally supported by central services personnel in our San Francisco, California headquarters who provide expertise with respect to areas such as user experience, software development kit (SDK) development, analytics and product marketing, with each studio leveraging these services to varying degrees. 
​
Our game development process involves a significant amount of creativity, particularly with respect to 

11



developing original intellectual property franchises or games in which we license intellectual property from celebrities, Hollywood studios or other owners of brands, properties and other content. Creative and technical studio expertise is necessary to design games that appeal to players who typically play in short sessions and to develop games that work well on mobile phones and tablets with their inherent limitations, such as small screen sizes and control buttons. During 2021, we plan to hire additional game development personnel and invest in technical studio expertise to drive content and features in our growth games and to prototype ideas that we believe can become hit growth games. 
Despite our efforts to reduce our geographical footprint and consolidate studios, our development personnel are located in five cities in three different countries, which results in certain inherent complexities. To address these issues, we instituted our Creative Leadership Summit program. The Creative Leadership Summit is designed to increase interaction among our studio teams, including having international studio team members regularly spend time in our U.S. studios. The goal of this program is to ensure that we increase the uniformity, quality and commercial success of our games. In addition, we believe that our strategy of focusing our development efforts on building and maintaining growth games will help ensure more efficient use of our talent and resources across our studios and further promote the sharing of expertise and best practices. 
​
Product Development
Since the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change, particularly in the technical capabilities of mobile phones and tablets, and changing end-user preferences, continuous investment is required to innovate and publish new games, regularly update our games, and modify existing games for distribution on new platforms. 
​
We have continued to utilize measures designed to ensure that we publish and launch games that have a greater likelihood of being commercially successful, while identifying earlier in the development process game concepts and designs that are unlikely to produce hits. Prior to developing a new game, a creative leader works with a small team to rapidly prototype new ideas that have the potential to become growth games. We expect our creative leaders to fail fast and to either continue to iterate on a game concept or to move on to rapidly prototyping a new concept. Once the creative leader and his or her team have sufficiently iterated on their concept and are satisfied that their game has the potential to be a growth game, the creative leader will submit a playable version of the game for greenlighting. If the game is greenlit, we then commit larger investments in terms of headcount and resources.
​
In addition, we plan to continue holding detailed post-mortems for all products to review and analyze the positive and negative results from each new game launch. These are in addition to our Creative Leadership Summit program where we formally share best practices and learnings amongst the leadership of all functions of our global studios and central services teams.
We use third-party development tools to create our games, including a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create most of our newest games and our games in development. In addition, we rely on our own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate our games and to maintain and provide our analytics data. In particular, a significant portion of game traffic is hosted by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), which provides us server redundancy by using multiple locations on various distinct power grids, and we expect to continue utilizing AWS for a significant portion of our hosting services for the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, we have made significant investments in building out a personalization and experimentation engine that seamlessly integrates with our proprietary analytics system, advertisement related activities, and game environment.  We believe this new capability will greatly enhance our ability to segment and personalize our players’ in-game experience with a focus on further monetizing our highest spending and most engaged players. We aim to connect the data, insights and knowledge gained from our analytics and monetization techniques to every element of our business – from marketing to merchandising – in order to improve player retention and monetization.
​
Seasonality
​
Many new smartphones and tablets are released in, or shortly before, the fourth calendar quarter to coincide with 

12



the holiday shopping season. Because many players download our games soon after they purchase or receive their new devices, we generally experience seasonal sales increases based on the holiday selling period. Although we believe that the majority of this holiday impact occurs during the fourth quarter, some of this seasonality also occurs for us in our first calendar quarter due to some lag between device purchases and game purchases. However, the impact of this seasonality on our operating results is significantly affected by our title release schedule. For example, we have historically released each year’s new version of our Tap Sports Baseball franchise late in the first quarter, which has resulted in revenue from this title peaking in the second or third quarter, with declining revenue in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year leading up to the launch of the next version of the title. In addition, companies’ advertising budgets are generally strongest during the fourth quarter and decline significantly in the first quarter of the following year, which affects the revenue we derive from advertisements and offers in our games. Conversely, our cost per install and cost per ad view also increase in the fourth quarter, since demand for marketing is higher during the holiday season.
​
Competition
​
Developing, distributing and selling mobile games is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts.  For players, we compete primarily on the basis of game quality, brand and customer reviews.  We compete for space on user’s smartphones and tablet devices in terms of the number of applications on their device and the amount of storage consumed by such applications. We also compete more generally for the time, attention and discretionary spending of users of smartphones and tablet devices who are spending ever-increasing amounts of time on social media, messaging and music, movie and television streaming applications, personal computer and console games, sports and the Internet. We compete for promotional and Digital Storefront placement based on our relationship with the Digital Storefront owner, historical performance, game quality, perception of sales potential, customer reviews and relationships with licensors of brands and other content.  For content licensors, we compete based on royalty and other economic terms, historical financial performance of prior licensed content titles, perceptions of development quality, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners.  We also compete for experienced and talented employees. 
We compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including Activision (the parent company of King Digital Entertainment), Disney, Electronic Arts (“EA Mobile”), Gameloft, Netmarble (including its Kabam Games subsidiary), Rovio, Stillfront, Warner Brothers, and Zynga and many well-funded private companies, including AppLovin, Epic Games, Jam City, Miniclip, Niantic, Playrix, Pocket Gems, Scopely, and Supercell. In addition, hyper-casual games published by companies such as Crazy Labs, Lion Studios, and Voodoo account for a significant and growing percentage of mobile gaming downloads.
We also face competition from online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused on specific international markets.  We could also face increased competition if those companies choose to compete more directly in the United States or the other markets that are significant to us or if large companies with significant online presences such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft or Verizon, choose to enter or expand in the games space or develop competing games.  For example, in 2019 Apple launched its Apple Arcade subscription service in which users receive access to a curated selection of paid titles on the App Store. In addition, we also face competition from mobile applications and websites focused on the home design market, which may include games, e-commerce titles, design applications and others seeking to displace our Design Home title which is a leading title in the currently unsaturated home design application market. Competitors in this space include Redecor – Home Design Makeover published by Reworks Oy (“Reworks”), and may include established game developers, established real estate companies, interior design companies, e-commerce companies and other well-funded private companies looking to enter the home design market. 
In addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets and the relatively low barriers to entry, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise.  As an example of the competition that we face, it has been estimated that more than 4.5 million applications, including nearly 1 million active games, were available on Apple’s U.S. App Store as of January 31, 2021.  The proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for players without substantially increasing our marketing expenses and 

13



development costs.
We also compete for downloads and time spent on mobile devices with companies that develop popular social media and messaging applications, such as Facebook (with its Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp and other applications), Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube, companies that develop streaming music, movie and television applications, such as Pandora, Spotify, Tidal, Disney+, HBO Go, Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu, and with companies that create other non-gaming related software applications.
Some of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include:

●significantly greater financial resources;
●the ability or willingness to spend significantly more than we do to acquire new players, which may be due to competitors having games with higher lifetime values than our games (i.e., the amount of money the average paying player spends in the competitor’s game over the player’s lifetime is greater than in our games) or where a competitor is willing to pay to acquire users in a manner that does not have a positive return on investment in an effort to increase its revenue and/or user base;
●greater experience with free-to-play games, building and maintaining growth games, and building social and community features into mobile games, as well as more effective game monetization;
●stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;
●the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;
●larger installed user bases from their existing mobile games;
●larger installed user bases from related platforms, such as console gaming or social networking websites, to which they can market and sell mobile games;
●more substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties;
●lower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale;
●greater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise;
●broader global distribution and presence; and


● | greater talent, both in overall headcount and in terms of experience in creating successful titles.

​
Intellectual Property
​
Our intellectual property is essential to our business. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our employees and independent contractors are required to sign agreements acknowledging that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any ownership that they may claim in those works. We also vigorously defend our intellectual property. For example, we recently filed a lawsuit against Reworks, seeking a judgment finding that Reworks has infringed one of our patents as well as seeking injunctive relief and monetary damages for past and ongoing infringement. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use without our consent 

14



intellectual property that we own or license. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, including piracy, and the expenses incurred in protecting our intellectual property rights, may adversely affect our business. In addition, some of our competitors have in the past released games that are nearly identical to successful games released by their competitors in an effort to confuse the market and divert users from the competitor’s game to the copycat game. To the extent that these tactics are employed with respect to any of our games, it could reduce our revenue.
​
Our trademarks that have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office include Glu, Crowdstar, our 2-D ‘g’ character logo, our 3-D ‘g’ character logo and several of our game titles, including Cooking Dash, Covet Fashion, Deer Hunter, Diner Dash, and Tap Sports. In addition, we have trademark applications pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for other of our game titles. For certain titles we do not yet have, and do not intend to seek, trademark registration.  We also own, or have applied to own, one or more registered trademarks in certain foreign countries, depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets, including registrations for Design Home. Registrations of both U.S. and foreign trademarks are renewable every ten years.
​
To date, we have seventeen issued U.S. patents and two U.S. patent applications currently outstanding, including two that we inherited through acquisitions, thus precluding our ability to protect the majority of our technologies from independent invention by third parties.  In addition, we have filed foreign patent applications on two of the issued U.S. patents. 
​
We also use third-party development tools to create many of our games, including a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create most of our newest games.  
From time to time, we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. If we do not prevail in these disputes, we may lose some or all of our intellectual property protection, be enjoined from further sales of our games or other applications determined to infringe the rights of others, and/or be forced to pay substantial royalties to a third party, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
Government Regulation
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect our business, including those relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information and those relating to the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, advertising and marketing activities, sweepstakes and contests, and gambling. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our customers, and deliver products and services, or may significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations, our compliance requirements and costs will increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
Human Capital
​
We foster and maintain a workplace that values the unique talents and contributions of every individual. We believe it is the diversity of our people, with varied skills, backgrounds and cultures, that shape our success and innovation. Our people-focused culture is driven by collaboration and global cross-functional connections. We recognize the success of Glu is dependent on our talent and the satisfaction of our global workforce, and we are greatly invested in their ability to succeed and thrive. The following discussions provide a description of our employees, and outline how we manage our human capital and how we invest in our employees’ success.
​
Headcount
​
As of December 31, 2020, we had 802 employees, of which 468 were based in the United States, 61 in Canada, and 273 in India. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 27% of the global team was female and 73% was male. 
​

15



We have not experienced any employment-related work stoppages due to the COVID-19 pandemic and consider relations with our employees to be good. Specifically, in response to local government and health guidelines around the COVID-19 pandemic we shifted almost all of our employees to remote work and began offering tools and services for optimizing remote work. We believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate and retain qualified employees in any operating environment. 
​
Recruiting
​
We believe in investing for the future, including the future of our workforce, and have several talent programs to recruit exceptional individuals who share our values. Our recruiting team and hiring managers begin with the creation of detailed job descriptions, which clearly outline the skills and experience necessary for success in each role. We believe these steps are essential to effectively interview for identifiable skillsets and not just “personality fits.” We strive to build our workforce from within whenever possible; however, if the best candidate for an available position is not identified from within our existing talent pool, we will look externally for the best talent. Our recruitment strategy is to initially search for candidates directly through our professional networks, university and mentorship programs, and through advertising with certain partners. We also occasionally use recruitment consultants and search firms.
​
Professional Development
​
We are committed to helping people realize their highest potential and fostering a culture that supports personal development for individuals, leaders and teams across the organization. Our employees enjoy ample opportunity to learn new skills to develop and advance their career, and we ensure that all our employees receive ongoing formal training to help foster their professional development. We also encourage continuing education programs by providing a tuition reimbursement program for employees wishing to pursue approved degree and non-degree programs through approved institutions and online learning providers such as Udemy.
​
Employee Feedback
​
We value the feedback from our employees to help us understand what we are doing well and where we need to improve. Our annual employee engagement survey asks all of our employees for their input on a variety of matters. The results of the employee survey are disseminated to all employees, and the results are used to design action plans to assist managers with actively responding to employees’ sentiments. The employee survey is an important tool that allows us to continuously improve, innovate and evolve through ongoing engagement and measurement. As a result of these steps and others, employee engagement has increased in the last year. 
​
Diversity and Inclusion
​
We are committed to building an inclusive culture and team environment that supports current and future diversity in our industry, our games, and our talent. In the spirit of Glu’s core value – we Win Together when we respect, acknowledge and celebrate each other’s differences. We are committed to creating an inclusive environment that promotes equality, cultural awareness and respect by implementing policies, benefits, training, recruiting and recognition practices to support our colleagues. We believe that diversity and inclusion is about valuing our differences and continually identifying ways to improve our cultural intelligence which ultimately leads to better decision-making and a more tailored client experience. To help us achieve and maintain a diverse workforce, we globally monitor certain employee demographic data such as gender, ethnicity, tenure and age. 
​
In late 2020, we launched our first-ever Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DE&I”) steering committee. In 2021, the committee’s task will be to review and address hiring and workforce priorities, promote DE&I learning and development opportunities for employees, and facilitate meaningful external partnerships. In an effort to support shared identities and interests and promote belonging, we are committed to facilitating the development of Business Resource Groups in the first half of 2021. 
​
Employee Compensation, Benefits & Wellbeing
​

We strive to enrich and elevate the lives of our employees through a robust compensation and benefits package that is flexible to meet both individual and family needs, including but not limited to:
​

● | Market competitive compensation packages;
--+------------------------------------------


● | Robust health and well-being benefits, including a variety of medical, dental, and vision benefit offerings, and on-site physical and mental health programs, such as complimentary yoga classes, to address work life balance issues;
