ITEM 1.            BUSINESS

We are a diversified television media company with national reach and a strong focus on providing high-quality content on our local television stations, regional sports networks, and digital platforms.  The content, distributed through our broadcast platform and third-party platforms, consists of programming provided by third-party networks and syndicators, local news, college and professional sports, and other original programming produced by us.  Additionally, we own digital media products that are complementary to our extensive portfolio of television station and RSN related digital properties. Outside of our media related businesses, we operate technical services companies focused on supply and maintenance of broadcast transmission systems as well as research and development for the advancement of broadcast technology, and we manage other non-media related investments.
We are a Maryland corporation founded in 1986.  Our principal executive offices are located at 10706 Beaver Dam Road, Hunt Valley, Maryland 21030.  Our telephone number is (410) 568-1500 and our website address is www.sbgi.net.  The information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated herein by reference.
Segments 
As of December 31, 2019, we have two reportable segments: local news and marketing services and sports. Our local news and marketing services segment is comprised of all of our television stations. Our sports segment is comprised of our regional sports networks. We also earn revenues from our owned networks, original content, digital and internet services, technical services, and non-media investments. These businesses are included within other.
Local News and Marketing Services
As of December 31, 2019, our local news and marketing services segment consists primarily of our broadcast television stations (stations). We own, provide programming and operating services pursuant to local marketing agreements (LMAs), or provide sales services and other non-programming operating services pursuant to other outsourcing agreements (such as JSAs and SSAs) to 191 stations in 89 markets. These stations broadcast 629 channels, including 241 channels affiliated with primary networks or program service providers comprised of:  FOX (59), ABC (41), CBS (30), NBC (24), CW (48), and MyNetworkTV (MNT) (39).  The other 388 channels broadcast programming from programming services including Antenna TV, Azteca, Bounce Network, CHARGE!, Comet, Dabl, Estrella TV, Get TV, Grit, Me TV, Movies!, Stadium, TBD, Telemundo, This TV, Unimas, Univision, Weather Nation, and two channels broadcasting independent programming.  Solely for the purpose of this report, these 191 stations and 629 channels are referred to as “our” stations and channels, and the use of such term shall not be construed as an admission that we control such stations or channels.  Refer to our Television Markets and Stations table later in this Item 1. for more information.
Our local news and marketing services segment provides free over-the-air programming to television viewing audiences in the communities we serve through our local television stations.  The programming that we provide on our primary channels consists of network provided programs, locally-produced news, local sporting events, programming from program service arrangements, syndicated entertainment programs, and internally originated programming. We provide live, local sporting events on many of our stations by acquiring the local television broadcast rights for these events.  
We are one of the nation's largest producers of local news. We produce approximately 2,550 hours of news per week at 129 stations in 81 markets. During 2019, our stations were awarded with 386 journalism awards, including four National Edward R. Murrow awards.

Our local news and marketing services segment derives revenue primarily from the sale of advertising inventory on our television stations and fees received from MVPDs for the right to distribute our channels on their distribution platforms. We also earn revenues by selling digital advertisements on third-party platforms and providing digital content to non-linear devices via websites, mobile, and social media advertisements. Our objective is to meet the needs of our advertising customers by delivering significant audiences in key demographics.  Our strategy is to achieve this objective by providing quality local news programming, popular network, syndicated and live sports programs, and other original content to our viewing audience.  We attract most of our national television advertisers through national marketing representation firms which have offices in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, and Dallas. Our local television advertisers are primarily attracted through the use of a local sales force at each of our television stations, which is comprised of approximately 700 marketing consultants and 100 local sales managers company-wide.
Our operating results are subject to cyclical fluctuations from political advertising.  Political spending has been significantly higher in the even-number years due to the cyclicality of political elections.  In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising related to the presidential election.  Because of the political election cyclicality, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing even-numbered years’ performance to the odd numbered years’ performance.  Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number and importance of individual political races and issues discussed on a national level as well as those within the local communities we serve.  We believe political advertising will continue to be an important advertising category in our industry. Political advertising levels may increase further as political-activism, around social, political, economic and environmental causes, continues to draw attention and Political Action Committees (PACs), including so-called Super PACs, continue to increase spending.

Sports
On August 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of the controlling interests in 21 Regional Sports Network brands and Fox College Sports (collectively, the Acquired RSNs) from the Walt Disney Company (Disney). See Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. In February 2019, we announced a joint venture with the Chicago Cubs (Cubs) that owns and operates Marquee Sports Network (Marquee, and, collectively with the Acquired RSNs, the RSNs), a regional sports network based in Chicago, Illinois. Marquee debuted February 22, 2020 with the airing of the Cubs’ first Spring Training game and is the Chicago-region’s exclusive network for fans to view live Cubs games, exclusive Cubs content, and other local sports programming. On August 29, 2019 we acquired a 20% equity interest in the Yankee Entertainment and Sports Network (the YES Network). 
Through the RSNs and YES Network, we own equity interests in the largest collection of RSNs in the United States, broadcasting over 4,600 professional sports games and producing over 24,000 hours of new content each year. Our RSNs are located in attractive, highly-populated geographic areas of the United States with significant local viewership and 45 of the most exciting professional sports teams. We are a premier destination for local sports viewership, with our premium live sports content reaching more than 61 million subscribers nationally. We have an extensive footprint that includes exclusive long-term agreements with 16 Major League Baseball (MLB) teams, 17 National Basketball Association (NBA) teams and 12 National Hockey League (NHL) teams. Within our RSN portfolio are 23 brands, and 16 networks of separate affiliation agreements. We generate revenues by distributing our networks to MVPDs and vMVPDs, and from the sale of advertising inventory.
As of December 31, 2019, our RSNs have relationships with the following professional teams: 

MLB Teams | NBA Teams | NHL Teams 
Arizona Diamondbacks | Atlanta Hawks | Anaheim Ducks 
Atlanta Braves | Charlotte Hornets | Arizona Coyotes 
Chicago Cubs | Cleveland Cavaliers | Carolina Hurricanes 
Cincinnati Reds | Dallas Mavericks | Columbus Blue Jackets
Cleveland Indians | Detroit Pistons | Dallas Stars

As of December 31, 2019, we also hold a noncontrolling interest in the YES Network, which has long term agreements with the New York Yankees and Brooklyn Nets. We also own Fox College Sports which offers collegiate programming throughout the country.
Other
Owned Networks and Content
We own and operate Tennis Channel, a cable network which includes coverage of many of tennis' top tournaments and original professional sport and tennis lifestyle shows; Tennis Magazine, the sport’s largest print publication; and Tennis.com (collectively, Tennis), the most visited online tennis platform in the world.
We also own and operate various networks carried on distribution platforms owned by us or others including: Comet, our science fiction multicast network; CHARGE!, our adventure and action-based emerging network; TBD, the first multiscreen TV network in the U.S. market to bring premium internet-first content to TV homes across America, and Stadium, a network that brings together professional sports highlights and college games. 
Our internally developed content, in addition to our local news, includes Ring of Honor (ROH), our professional wrestling promotion, Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson (Full Measure), our national Sunday morning investigative and political analysis program, and America This Week with Eric Bolling.
Digital and Internet
In January 2019, we launched STIRR, a national free, ad-supported direct-to-consumer streaming app, which offers live and on-demand content spanning entertainment, sports, and news. With more than 1.6 million app downloads in its first year and over 100 channel offerings, STIRR offers access to some of the most popular local news, entertainment and digital first channels. In January 2020, it also added an original channel "2020 LIVE" which will have continuous live coverage featuring campaign events from around the country, including town hall meetings and stump speeches.
We earn revenues from Compulse Integrated Marketing (Compulse), a full-service digital agency which uses our digital expertise to help businesses run social media, search, advertising, email marketing, web design, mobile marketing and creative services, and audience extension, and navigate and compete in a world of constant innovation and changes in consumer behavior. In August 2018, Compulse expanded its business with the launch of CompulseOTT, a new over-the-top advertising platform exclusively focused on OTT advertising.
DataSphere Technologies, provides marketing services to small businesses across the country and works in partnership with multiple media companies, including Sinclair. NewsON is a free, ad-supported app that provides instant access to live or on-demand local news broadcasts. Sinclair Digital Ventures focuses on investment in emerging digital technologies, ad tech, and digital content companies that support, compliment, or expand the Company's businesses. 
Technical Services
We own subsidiaries which are dedicated to providing technical services to the broadcast industry, including: Acrodyne Technical Services, a provider of service and support for broadcast transmitters throughout the world; Dielectric, a designer and manufacturer of broadcast systems including all components from transmitter output to antenna; ONE Media, a technology innovator at the forefront of developing industry standards and related technologies for NEXTGEN TV, a broadcast standard encompassing a flexible and enhanced vision for broadcasting; and ONE Media 3.0, a wholly-owned subsidiary whose purpose is to develop business opportunities, products, and services associated with the NEXTGEN TV broadcast transmission standard and TV platform. We have also partnered with Saankhya Labs to develop NEXTGEN TV technologies to be used in consumer devices, and formed a joint venture with SK Telecom focused on cloud infrastructure for broadcasting, ultra-low latency OTT broadcasting, and targeted advertising.
Non-media Investments
We own various non-media related investments across multiple asset classes including private equity, mezzanine financing, and real estate investments. Some of the largest investments include: Triangle Sign and Service (Triangle), a sign designer and fabricator; Jefferson Park, a mixed-use land development project in Frederick, MD; investments in sustainability initiatives; and a portfolio of apartment complexes.
Customers
In 2019, the local news and marketing services and sports segments had three customers, AT&T, Charter Communications, and Comcast, that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Any disruption in our relationship with AT&T, Charter Communications, or Comcast could have a material adverse effect on the local news and marketing segment, the sports segment, and our results of operation.
Operating Strategy
Programming to Attract Viewership.  We seek to target our programming offerings to attract viewership, to meet the needs of the communities in which we serve, and to meet the needs of our advertising customers.  
Our stations seek to broadcast live local and national sporting events that would appeal to a large segment of the local community.  Moreover, our stations produce local news at 129 stations in 81 markets. See News below for further discussion. Our stations also seek to develop original programming or obtain, at attractive prices, popular syndicated programming that is complementary to each station’s network programming. 
Television advertising prices are based on ratings information measured and distributed by Nielsen and Comscore. Except for its Household viewing in Set Meter Markets, Nielsen is currently not accredited by the Media Rating Council (MRC), an independent organization that monitors rating services. As of December 31, 2019, Sinclair’s footprint includes 12 markets measured by Code Reader methodology and 47 markets measured by RPD+ methodology, which uses Set Top Box data. Neither of these methodologies are currently accredited by the Media Rating Council. Comscore is an alternative rating service provider that uses set-top box television measurements to provide us additional measurement information to the ratings services that Nielsen provides for most of our stations. Comscore's local television ratings service is also not accredited by the MRC.
Our RSNs intend to continue to invest in producing popular sports programming, and measure audience engagement and needs to determine what our sports fans value most and to continue to work to deliver premier sports content in the markets in which we operate.
Our RSNs intend to continue investing in improving the viewer experience of our loyal sports fans by investing in technologies that will help tell the ‘‘story’’ of a sports game and make our offering more appealing to the viewer. These technologies could allow the viewer to control the camera angle, add customized audio tracks to the broadcast, integrate social media, overlay statistics, gaming or otherwise customize his or her experience. Additionally, our broad rights position us to benefit from new viewing technologies as they are developed, such as virtual, augmented and mixed reality. As these technological capabilities develop, we will invest in bringing them to our premium live sports content.
News.  Through local news, our mission is to serve our communities by sharing relevant information to alert, protect, and empower our audiences. We believe that the production and broadcasting of local news is an important link to the community and an aid to a station’s efforts to expand its viewership. In addition, local news programming can provide access to advertising sources targeted specifically to local news viewers. Our news stations also produce content on digital platforms such as websites, mobile applications, OTT, and social media. During the year ended December 31, 2019, 33% of our stations' net time sales were earned during the local news we produce each week.
Our local news initiatives are an important part of our strategy. We have entered into local news sharing arrangements in which we receive news in 10 markets from other in-market broadcasters. We believe that, in the markets where we have news share arrangements, such arrangements generally provide both higher viewer ratings and revenues for the station receiving the news and generate a profit for the news share provider. Generally, both parties and the local community are beneficiaries of these arrangements.
In addition to our traditional local news stories, we have utilized our national reach and physical presence in the nation's capital to provide our local viewers with broader national news stories which are relevant to our local viewers.
Our local news coverage is supported by our national news desk and Capitol Hill bureau. These teams focus on providing context and perspective to important stories in the daily news cycle. This content provides a significant point of difference with a focus on accountability reporting for our stations. Available on-air and online, the bureau not only expands our news presence, but gives our local station viewers an opportunity to hear the views of their members of Congress through programs such as "Connect to Congress," our weekly on-air and digital feature which provides an electronic video pathway for lawmakers to speak to their constituents. Our weekly investigative news program, Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson, reinforces our mission to provide our fearless storytelling on significant topics of public importance. 
We have a national investigative news unit consisting of more than 50 reporters and 20 producers, which we plan to grow, to provide in-depth stories not covered elsewhere.
We also provide our viewers with "Town Halls," which brings together our viewers to discuss major local and national topics. In 2018 we began producing "Your Voice Your Future Opioid Town Hall" and in 2019 we produced 25 Town Halls on the opioids crisis. Sinclair is in its 8th year of producing award winning Town Halls, Roundtables and Debates. Our "Your Voice Your Future" series produced 90 distinctive productions in 2019 educating and empowering our viewers with topics of local and national importance. Guests from all sides of the political spectrum offered insight on topics covering opioids, education, school vaccinations, child abuse, crime & violence, health care, the nationally recognized “Seattle is Dying”, several local debates, and City in Crisis from our flagship station in Baltimore. In total we have produced close to 700 one-hour long productions, often with a studio audience, and always with audience participation. We continue Sinclair’s dedication in 2020 with over 150 Town Hall productions scheduled.
Through our free, ad-supported streaming app STIRR, we offer access to 100 channels with some of the most popular being local news programs. In January 2020, STIRR added the original channel "2020 LIVE" to further expand the platform's election coverage. We also own NewsOn, a single app to watch live, local news on mobile and OTT devices.
Sports. Live sports have remained highly popular with fans and advertisers. Sports programming generally elicits strong emotional responses and attracts a loyal and passionate following among fans. Our premium live sports programming typically attracts viewership demographics that are highly desirable to advertisers. Sports viewership among the key 25 to 54 year-old demographic is growing relative to all other content. Every sports season is a new chapter in a story that has continued for decades and is popular across fans from multiple generations. As media has continued to trend toward on-demand consumption, sports events have remained an ‘‘appointment viewing’’ event. As such, live sports content is frequently the most watched programming in a local market on most nights. The acquisition of the RSNs is in response to this strategy.
Tennis has certain telecast rights to the U.S. Open; Wimbledon; Roland Garros (French Open); Australian Open; ATP World Tour Masters 1000, 500, and 250 events; WTA Premier, International, and Finals; Laver Cup; Hopman Cup; ATP and WTA Pro Circuit; and College and Junior events and exhibitions. Our stations also broadcast programming and other content provided by Tennis and we provide access to certain events through our premium OTT offering, Tennis Channel Plus. Tennis also includes Tennis.com, the most visited online tennis platform in the world. Tennis' complementary offerings allows us to provide greater and more in depth tennis content to consumers on TV, internet, and print. 
Additionally, some of our stations have the local television broadcast rights for certain sporting events, including MLB, NBA, NHL, National Football League (NFL), and certain other college and high school sports. Our CW and MyNetworkTV stations generally face fewer preemption restrictions on broadcasting live local sporting events compared with our FOX, ABC, CBS, and NBC stations, which are required to broadcast a greater number of hours of programming supplied by the networks. In addition, our stations that are affiliated with FOX, ABC, CBS, and NBC have network arrangements to broadcast certain MLB, NBA, NHL, NFL, and Professional Golf Association (PGA) events, as well as other popular sporting events.
Control of Operating and Programming Costs.  By employing a disciplined approach to managing programming acquisition and other costs, our stations have been able to achieve operating margins that we believe are very competitive within the television broadcast industry. We believe our national reach as of December 31, 2019 of approximately 39% of the country provides us with a strong position to negotiate with programming providers and, as a result, the opportunity to purchase high quality programming at more favorable prices. Moreover, we emphasize control of each of our station’s programming and operating costs through program-specific profit analysis, detailed budgeting, regionalization of staff, and detailed long-term planning models. We also control our programming cost by creating original high-quality programming that is distributed on our broadcast platform.
Our RSNs manage our programming rights costs to improve margins and increase our cash flow. We intend to balance our portfolio to ensure that losing one team’s rights will not materially harm the overall product offering. We intend to maintain our disciplined approach to non-programming expense management by seeking opportunities to increase our efficiency without jeopardizing our commitment to provide high quality sports content to our customers. We will seek to emphasize high quality production at low cost with a continuous focus on technological advancements and managing the cost of on-air talent retention, overhead, and salaries and compensation. 
Developing Local Franchises.  We believe the greatest opportunity for a sustainable and growing customer base lies within our local communities. Therefore, we have focused on developing a strong local sales force, which is comprised of approximately 700 marketing consultants and 100 local sales managers company-wide. Excluding the acquired RSNs, political advertising revenue, distribution revenues, and other local revenues, 62% and 54% of net time sales were local for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our goal is to grow our local revenues by increasing our market share, developing new business opportunities, and offering marketing solutions across our platforms. 
Attract and Retain High Quality Management.  We believe that much of our success is due to our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled and motivated managers at corporate, stations, RSNs, and other businesses.  We provide a combination of base salary, long-term incentive compensation including equity awards and, where appropriate, cash bonus pay designed to be competitive with comparable employers in our industry.  A significant portion of the compensation available to certain members of our senior management and our sales force is based on their achievement of certain performance goals. We also encourage station and network managers and employees to utilize our diverse business to grow in their careers while remaining in the Sinclair family via internal promotion and relocation.
Multi-Channel Broadcasting.  FCC rules allow television broadcasters to transmit additional digital channels within the spectrum allocated to each FCC license holder. This provides our stations' viewers with additional programming alternatives at no additional cost to them. We may consider other alternative programming formats that we could air using our multi-channel digital spectrum space with the goal towards achieving higher profits and community service. As of December 31, 2019, our stations have 438 multi-channels in our digital spectrum.
Distribution Agreements.  We have distribution agreements with MVPDs, vMVPDs, and OTT distributors who compensate us for the right to retransmit our stations, RSNs, and other offerings on their respective distribution platforms.  Our successful negotiations with MVPDs have created agreements that produce meaningful sustainable revenue streams. We intend to maintain the strong relationships with our linear MVPD partners. In addition, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to expand our vMVPD distribution. Many of our existing sports programming rights agreements include springing rights that automatically provide our RSNs with the rights to additional forms of distribution if the leagues permit their teams to exploit those distribution rights, enabling us to continue to adapt to changing consumption habits.
Improvement and Maintenance of Our Distribution Platforms.  Our Acrodyne and Dielectric subsidiaries are leaders in servicing and manufacturing broadcast infrastructure. As a result, we maintain a strong infrastructure through which we provide high quality uninterrupted content on our stations. These subsidiaries are critical in both the repack of the broadcast spectrum and the buildout of the infrastructure behind the NEXTGEN TV for both our stations and other broadcasters.
Developing New Business.  We strive to develop new business models to complement or enhance our traditional television broadcast business.  We have developed new ways to sell online, mobile text messaging, social media advertising, and audience extension services along with our traditional commercial broadcasting model.  Additionally, we continue to leverage our national reach to provide new high-quality content to our local communities.
We continue to expand our digital distribution platforms through initiatives such as our video management system, which simplifies and automates our broadcast-to-digital streaming workflow and allows for dynamic replacement of broadcast ads with digital ads targeted to each individual viewer and allows us to ingest and redistribute content across our platform so that we can break news first. By using a single ad-serving system across all of our web sites, mobile apps, and other digital assets, we are able to streamline our sales workflow, optimize yield, and deliver comprehensive sales opportunities across our digital footprint. Additionally, we are deploying direct-to-consumer (DTC) and OTT initiatives, such as STIRR, as well as our own content applications. 
Additionally, we have continued to develop business opportunities, products, and services associated with NEXTGEN TV as discussed under Development of Next Generation Wireless Platform below.
Our RSNs seek to maximize growth in our advertising revenue. We believe that through higher quality non-game programming and multiplatform offerings, we will be able to drive incremental improvements in our RSN advertising revenues. We believe political advertising, which historically has been a relatively small portion of our RSN advertising revenue, could be an avenue to grow advertising dollars given our RSNs’ large viewing audiences. Our live sports content is appealing to both national and local advertisers and is diverse across industries. In addition, we believe the revenues generated by legalized sports betting can generate both advertising and sponsorships, and we believe that we would be able to generate higher ratings and advertising spending due to increased engagement expected from bettors.
Many of our existing sports programming rights agreements include springing rights that automatically provide our RSNs with the rights to additional forms of distribution as soon as the leagues permit their teams to exploit those distribution rights. Once our RSNs are permitted to expand into digital streaming, we expect to monetize our viewership by selling targeted advertising on our digital feeds and introduce our digital agency services to our RSN advertisers. We believe that our RSN portfolio is well-positioned to capitalize on the ongoing transition of the media world to digital and mobile viewing.
Strategic Realignment of Media Portfolio.  We routinely review potential media acquisitions, dispositions, swaps, or develop original networks and content.  We expect to remain acquisitive and continue to assess opportunities to complement our existing stations, RSNs, and other businesses. As we evaluate potential acquisitions, we intend to focus on making disciplined, accretive acquisitions that will complement our existing portfolio of television stations and RSNs while providing increased scale. At any given time, we may be in discussions with one or more media owners.
Digital and Internet.  Our digital properties, Compulse, STIRR, Datasphere, and NewsOn are innovative products and extensions of our core broadcast business that allow us to compete for digital, internet, network, and print impressions and revenues. We continue to seek additional opportunities to invest in emerging digital technologies, ad tech, and digital content companies that support and expand Sinclair's digital capabilities and non-linear footprint. 
Development of Next Generation Wireless Platform. In 2017, the FCC approved the use of NEXTGEN TV, a next generation broadcast transmission standard. NEXTGEN TV is capable of merging broadcast and broadband content and data services using over-the-air spectrum and Internet-provided data connectivity, allowing a mature broadcast industry to reinvent itself due to its mobility, addressability, capacity, IP connectivity, and conditional access.
NEXTGEN TV will allow us to use our spectrum for more than just video-formatted data as we do today. As a data-agnostic Internet Protocol (IP) based pipe, we also will be able to distribute data including text, audio, video, and software. While our one-to-many architecture will remain a strength, we will be able to deliver “the last mile” from program/data origination to the consumer's receiver device across a more robust system, connect legacy ATSC 1.0 televisions to NEXTGEN TV using broadcast hot spots and wi-fi functionality, and provide compatible data-offload service offerings in conjunction with certain 5G platforms. Among the many emerging opportunities are hyper-local news, weather, and traffic; dynamic ad insertion; geographic and demographic-targeted advertising; customizable content; better measurement and analytics; the ability to interface with devices connected to the Internet; flexibility to add streams as needed; substantially enhanced picture quality with immersive audio; connectivity to automobiles, including 3D mapping, telematics and infotainment; data wholesale models; and other content delivery networks. Conditional access capabilities also permit broadcasters to offer secure “skinny-bundle” pay services as well as various video-on-demand type offerings. In addition, NEXTGEN TV provides new emergency and information capabilities, including advanced alerting functions which can provide crucial rich media including evacuation routes and device wake-up features. All of these features will be available to mobile and portable devices, allowing us to reach viewers virtually anywhere. In January 2020, we announced the formation of Cast.era, a joint venture with SK Telecom, focused on cloud infrastructure for broadcasting, ultra-low latency OTT broadcasting, and targeted advertising.
In order to bring this technology to the market, we have partnered with technology leaders to develop broadcasting solutions and services in the U.S. and globally. We have also formed a joint venture with other broadcasters, SpectrumCo, to promote spectrum efficiency and innovation, aggregate and monetize underutilized spectrum capacity over which to deliver national services, and create opportunities such as robust video and data exchange. We continue to work with other NEXTGEN TV stakeholders to build and test the single frequency network tower infrastructure, develop systems to allow the convergence of NEXTGEN TV and 5G data delivery, and design NEXTGEN TV receiver chips for mobile, portable and fixed devices. We expect the implementation and adoption of NEXTGEN TV to occur over the next three years. Throughout 2020, we and the industry will begin deployment of NEXTGEN TV capabilities on some of our own television facilities and in conjunction with other station operators in our markets, as well as non-Sinclair markets. When completed, the country will have a lower-cost, world class wireless IP data distribution network capable of supporting multiple business models.
Monetization of Certain Intellectual Property Rights. We have developed, on our own and through our ONE Media, LLC joint venture, several NEXTGEN TV-related patents that we intend to monetize directly, through third-party agents, or through a patent pool designed to consolidate similar patents owned by independent licensors for licensing to equipment manufacturers.
FEDERAL REGULATION OF TELEVISION BROADCASTING
The ownership, operation, and sale of television stations are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under the authority granted by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act).  Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for broadcasting; determines the particular frequencies, locations, and operating power of stations; issues, renews, revokes, and modifies station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation, and employment practices of stations; and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules and regulations of the Communications Act.
The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and specific FCC regulations and policies.  Reference should be made to the Communications Act, FCC rules, and the public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.
License Grant and Renewal
Television stations operate pursuant to broadcasting licenses that are granted by the FCC for maximum terms of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC.  During certain periods when renewal applications are pending, petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by interested parties, including members of the public.
Although historically renewal of a license, including those of the Company, is granted in the vast majority of cases, even when petitions to deny are filed, there can be no assurance that the license of any station will be renewed or, if renewed, that the renewal terms will be for the maximum term permitted.
All of our stations' most recent license renewal applications have been granted for the maximum term permitted. The next television license renewal application cycle will begin on June 1, 2020. On November 26, 2018, the American Cable Association (ACA) filed an informal request with the FCC seeking to require the early filing of renewal applications for the licenses of four of our stations, and an individual filed a similar informal request on July 22, 2019. We filed an opposition to ACA’s informal request on December 10, 2018 and an opposition to the individual’s informal request on August 1, 2019. These matters remain pending, and we cannot predict whether or when the FCC will take action on these informal requests.
Ownership Matters
General.  The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the FCC.  In determining whether to permit the assignment or transfer of control of, or the grant or renewal of, a broadcast license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee, including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the “character” of the licensee and those persons holding “attributable” interests in that licensee and compliance with the Communications Act’s limitations on foreign ownership.  The FCC has indicated that in order to approve an assignment or transfer of a broadcast license the FCC must make an affirmative determination that the proposed transaction serves the public interest, not merely that the transaction does not violate its rules or shares factual elements with other transactions previously approved by the FCC, and that it may deny a transaction if it determines that the transaction would not be in the public interest.
The FCC generally applies its ownership limits to “attributable” interests held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other association.  In the case of corporations holding, or through subsidiaries controlling, broadcast licenses, the interests of officers, directors and those who, directly or indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the corporation’s stock (or 20% or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies, investment companies and bank trust departments that are passive investors) are generally attributable.  In addition, pursuant to what is known as the equity-debt-plus rule, a major programming supplier or same-market media entity will be an attributable owner of a station if the supplier or same-market media entity holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33% of the value of the station’s total debt plus equity.  Further, the Communications Act generally prohibits foreign parties from having more than a 20% interest (voting or equity) in a broadcast licensee or more than a 25% interest in the parent of that licensee without receiving prior FCC approval to exceed these limits. Following a Declaratory Ruling in 2013 in which the Commission indicated that it was open to considering proposals for foreign investment in broadcast licenses that exceed the 25% benchmark on a case by case basis, on September 29, 2016, the FCC adopted a Report and Order which among other things, (i) simplified the foreign ownership approval process for broadcast licensees seeking to exceed the 25% benchmark and (ii) modified the methodology a licensee may use to determine compliance with the foreign ownership rules.
Sinclair and its subsidiaries are domestic corporations, and the members of the Smith family (who, as of December 31, 2019, together hold approximately 76.8% of the common voting rights of Sinclair) are all United States citizens.  Our amended and restated Articles of Incorporation (the Amended Certificate) contain limitations on alien ownership and control that are substantially similar to those contained in the Communications Act.  Pursuant to the Amended Certificate, we have the right to repurchase alien-owned shares at their fair market value to the extent necessary, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, to comply with the alien ownership restrictions.
Additional ownership rules as currently in effect are as follows:
Radio / Television Cross-Ownership Rule and Newspaper / Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule.  Until February 2018, the FCC’s rules (i) limited the combined number of television and radio stations a party could own in a market to up to two television stations and six radio stations, depending on the number of independent media voices in the market, and (ii) prohibited the common ownership of a radio or television broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same market.  On November 20, 2017, the FCC released an Order on Reconsideration (Ownership Order on Reconsideration) that, among other changes, eliminated the Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule and the Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule. The rule changes adopted in the Ownership Order on Reconsideration became effective on February 7, 2018. Petitions for Review of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration were filed before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Sinclair filed to intervene in the proceeding. On September 23, 2019, the court vacated and remanded the Ownership Order on Reconsideration. Petitions for rehearing en banc were filed with the Third Circuit by the FCC and industry intervenors (including the Company) on November 7, 2019. The Third Circuit denied the petitions for rehearing on November 20, 2019 and the court’s mandate issued on November 29, 2019. On February 7, 2020, the FCC and industry intervenors filed applications to extend the time to file petitions for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court from February 18, 2020 to March 19, 2020, which applications were granted on February 12, 2020. We cannot predict whether the Supreme Court will grant a writ of certiorari or what the outcome of the proceeding would be. We do not currently own any daily newspapers.
National Ownership Rule.  The national television viewing audience reach cap is 39%.  Under this rule, where an individual or entity has an attributable interest in more than one television station in a market, the percentage of the national television viewing audience encompassed within that market is only counted once.  Additionally, because VHF stations (channels 2 through 13) historically covered a larger portion of the market than UHF stations (channels 14 through 51), only half of the households in the market area of any UHF station are included when calculating an entity’s national television viewing audience (commonly referred to as the UHF discount). On September 6, 2016, the FCC released a Report and Order eliminating the UHF discount (the “UHF Discount Order”), and on April 21, 2017, the Commission released an Order on Reconsideration (the “UHF Discount Order on Reconsideration”) to reinstate the UHF discount pending a future rulemaking to examine the UHF discount together with the national audience reach cap. The UHF discount was reinstated on June 15, 2017 and is currently in effect. A Petition for Review of the UHF Discount Order on Reconsideration was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on May 12, 2017, and was dismissed by the Court on July 25, 2018. On December 18, 2017, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to examine the national audience reach cap, including the UHF discount. The rulemaking proceeding remains pending. We cannot predict the outcome of the rulemaking proceeding.
The majority of the stations we own and operate, or to which we provide programming services, are UHF. With the UHF discount, our current reach (for FCC purposes) is approximately 25% of U.S. households.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risk related to the outcome of rules governing the UHF discount.
Local Television (Duopoly) Rule.  A party may own television stations in adjoining markets, even if there is a digital noise limited service contour overlap between the two stations’ broadcast signals, and generally may own two stations in the same market only (i) if there is no digital overlap between the stations; or (ii) not more than one station is among the top-four rated stations in the market (the top-four rule). Prior to the Ownership Order on Reconsideration, the FCC did not allow a party to own more than one station in the same market if there was digital overlap between the stations unless the market containing both the stations would contain at least eight independently owned full-power television stations post-merger (the eight voices test). The Ownership Order on Reconsideration eliminated the eight voices test. The Ownership Order on Reconsideration also modified the top-four rule to permit parties to own up to two top-four rated stations in the same market on a case-by-case basis. Both rule changes became effective on February 7, 2018. Petitions for Review of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration, including the changes to the Local Television Rule, were filed before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On September 23, 2019, the court vacated and remanded the Ownership Order on Reconsideration. Petitions for rehearing en banc were filed with the Third Circuit by the FCC and industry intervenors (including the Company) on November 7, 2019. The Third Circuit denied the petitions for rehearing on November 20, 2019 and the court’s mandate issued on November 29, 2019. On February 7, 2020, the FCC and industry intervenors filed applications to extend the time to file petitions for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court from February 18, 2020 to March 19, 2020, which applications were granted on February 12, 2020. We cannot predict whether the Supreme Court will grant a writ of certiorari or what the outcome of the proceeding would be.
Local Marketing and Outsourcing Agreements
Certain of our stations have entered into agreements with other stations in the same market, through which we provide programming and operating services pursuant to time brokerage or local marketing agreements (LMAs) or provide sales services and other non-programming operating services pursuant to outsourcing agreements, such as joint sales agreements (JSAs) and shared services agreements (SSAs).  LMAs are attributable where a licensee holds an attributable interest in a television station and (i) programs more than 15% of the weekly broadcast hours and/or (ii) sells more than 15% of the weekly advertising time on another television station in the same market. LMAs existing prior to November 5, 1996 are currently grandfathered until further FCC action. Currently, all of our LMAs are grandfathered under the local television ownership rule because they were entered into prior to November 5, 1996. If the FCC were to eliminate the grandfathering of these LMAs, we would have to terminate or modify these LMAs.
In August 2016, the FCC completed both its 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews of its media ownership rules and issued an order (Ownership Order) which left most of the existing multiple ownership rules intact, but amended the rules to provide for the attribution of JSAs where two television stations are located in the same market, and a party with an attributable interest in one station sells more than 15% of the advertising time per week of the other station. JSAs existing as of March 31, 2014 were grandfathered until October 1, 2025, at which point they would have to be terminated, amended or otherwise come into compliance with the JSA attribution rule. The subsequent Ownership Order on Reconsideration eliminated the JSA attribution rule. The rule changes adopted in the Ownership Order on Reconsideration became effective on February 7, 2018. Petitions for Review of the Ownership Order on Reconsideration, including the elimination of the JSA attribution rule, were filed before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On September 23, 2019, the court vacated and remanded the Ownership Order on Reconsideration., resulting in the reinstatement of the majority of the Ownership Order, including the JSA attribution rule. Petitions for rehearing en banc were filed with the Third Circuit by the FCC and industry intervenors (including the Company) on November 7, 2019. The Third Circuit denied the petitions for rehearing on November 20, 2019 and the court’s mandate issued on November 29, 2019. On February 7, 2020, the FCC and industry intervenors filed applications to extend the time to file petitions for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court form February 18, 2020 to March 19, 2020, which applications were granted on February 12, 2020. We cannot predict whether the Supreme Court will grant a writ of certiorari or what the outcome of the proceeding would be. If we are required to terminate or modify our LMAs or JSAs, our business could be adversely affected in several ways, including losses on investments and termination penalties. For more information on the risks, see Changes in rules on local marketing agreements under "The FCC’s multiple ownership rules may limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs.  Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets." within Item 1A. Risk Factors and Changes in the Rules of Television Ownership, Local Marketing Agreements, Joint Sales Agreements, Retransmission Consent Negotiations, and National Ownership Cap under Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Antitrust Regulation.  The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission have increased their scrutiny of the television industry and have reviewed matters related to the concentration of ownership within markets (including LMAs and outsourcing agreements) even when ownership or the LMA or other outsourcing agreement in question is permitted under the laws administered by the FCC or by FCC rules and regulations.  The DOJ takes the position that an LMA or other outsourcing agreement entered into in anticipation of a station’s acquisition with the proposed buyer of the station constitutes a change in beneficial ownership of the station which, if subject to filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, cannot be implemented until the waiting period required by that statute has ended or been terminated.
On January 4, 2019, the Company received three civil investigative demands (CIDs) from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ. We believe the DOJ has similar civil investigative demands to other companies in our industry. In each CID, the DOJ requested that the Company produce certain documents and materials relating to JSAs in a specific DMA. We are cooperating and are in discussions with the DOJ regarding our responses to the CIDs. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of the CID process, including whether it will result in any action or proceeding against us.
Satellite Carriage
The Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA), as extended by The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 (SHVIA), the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act (SHVERA), the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 (STELA) and the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization (STELAR) among other things, (i) allows satellite carriers to provide local television signals by satellite within a station market, and requires them to carry all local signals that asserted carriage rights in any market where they carry any local signals, (ii) requires all television stations to elect to exercise certain “must-carry” or “retransmission consent” rights in connection with their carriage by satellite carriers, and (iii) authorizes satellite delivery of distant network signals, significantly viewed signals and local low-power television station signals into local markets under defined circumstances. In adopting fiscal year 2020 appropriations legislation, Congress allowed STELAR to sunset on December 31, 2019 but made permanent STELAR’s (1) requirements that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate retransmission content in good faith and (2) distant signal satellite license provisions for RVs, truckers, tailgaters and short markets. To qualify for the permanent license, satellite operators must deliver local-into-local service in all currently “unserved” markets by the appropriations bill’s May 31, 2020 deadline.
Must-Carry / Retransmission Consent
Television broadcasters are required to make triennial elections to exercise either certain “must-carry” or “retransmission consent” rights in connection with their carriage by cable systems in each broadcaster’s local market.   By electing to exercise must-carry rights, a broadcaster demands carriage and receives a specific channel on cable systems within its DMA. Must carry rights are not absolute and are dependent on a number of factors which may or may not be present in a particular case.  Alternatively, if a broadcaster chooses to exercise retransmission consent rights, it can prohibit cable systems from carrying its signal or grant the appropriate cable system the authority to retransmit the broadcast signal for a fee or other consideration.  We have elected to exercise our retransmission consent rights with respect to all of our stations. In February 2015, the FCC issued an order implementing certain statutorily required changes to its rules governing the duty to negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith. Under these rules, unless the stations are directly or indirectly under common de jure control as permitted under the regulations of the Commission, a station may not delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to a station located in the same market or to a third party that negotiates together with another television station in the same market, nor may stations in the same market facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms for their stations in that market, including through the sharing of information.
Further, in September 2015, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in response to a Congressional directive in STELAR to examine the “totality of the circumstances test” for good-faith negotiations of retransmission consent. The proposed rulemaking sought comment on new factors and evidence to consider in its evaluation of claims of bad faith negotiation, including service interruptions prior to a “marquee sports or entertainment event,” restrictions on online access to broadcast programming during negotiation impasses, broadcasters’ ability to offer bundles of broadcast signals with other broadcast stations or cable networks, and broadcasters’ ability to invoke the FCC’s exclusivity rules during service interruptions. On July 14, 2016, the FCC's then-Chairman Wheeler announced that the FCC would not, at that time, proceed to adopt additional rules governing good faith negotiations of retransmission consent. No formal action has yet been taken on this Proposed Rulemaking, and we cannot predict if the full Commission will agree to terminate the Rulemaking without action.
Network Non-Duplication / Syndicated Exclusivity / Territorial Exclusivity
The FCC’s syndicated exclusivity rules allow local broadcast television stations to demand that cable operators black out syndicated non-network programming carried on “distant signals” (i.e., signals of broadcast stations, including so-called “superstations,” which serve areas substantially removed from the cable systems’ local community).  The FCC’s network non-duplication rules allow local broadcast, network affiliated stations to require that cable operators black out duplicate network programming carried on distant signals.  Both rules are subject to various exceptions and limitations.  In a number of markets in which we own or program stations affiliated with a network, a station that is affiliated with the same network in a nearby market is carried on cable systems in our markets.  Such significantly viewed signals are not subject to black out pursuant to the FCC’s network non-duplication rules.  The carriage of two network stations on the same cable system could result in a decline of viewership, adversely affecting the revenues of our owned or programmed stations.  In March 2014, the FCC issued a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, requesting comments on whether it has authority to, and should, eliminate or modify its network non-duplication and/or syndicated exclusivity rules.  This proceeding is pending and we cannot predict when or how the FCC will resolve that rulemaking.
Digital Television
FCC rules provide that television broadcast licensees may use their digital television (DTV) channels for a wide variety of services such as HD television, multiple standard definition television programming, audio, data, and other types of communications, subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standard and further subject to the requirement that broadcasters pay a fee of 5% of gross revenues from any DTV ancillary or supplementary service for which there is a subscription fee or for which the licensee receives a fee from a third party. These rules could impact the profitability related to ancillary or supplementary services provided as discussed within Development of Next Generation Wireless Platform under Operating Strategy above.
Programming and Operations
The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest.”  The FCC has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed in the past to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station’s community of license.  FCC licensees continue to be required, however, to present programming that is responsive to the needs and interests of their communities and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness.  Complaints from viewers concerning a station’s programming may be considered by the FCC when it evaluates renewal applications of a licensee, although such complaints may be filed at any time and generally may be considered by the FCC at any time.  Stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various rules promulgated under the Communications Act that regulate, among other things, political advertising, sponsorship identifications, obscene and indecent broadcasts, and technical operations, including limits on radio frequency radiation. In addition, television licensees have obligations to create and follow employment outreach programs, provide a minimum amount of programming for children, comply with rules relating to the emergency alert system (EAS), maintain an online public inspection file, and abide by regulations specifying requirements to provide closed captions for its programming. FCC licensees are, in general, responsible for the content of their broadcast programming, including that supplied by television networks.  Accordingly, there is a risk of being fined as a result of our broadcast programming, including network programming.
On October 24, 2017, the FCC approved the elimination of the main studio rule, which required each broadcast television, FM radio, and AM radio licensee to have a main studio staffed with at least two employees located in or near its station’s local community.  The elimination of the main studio rule became effective on January 8, 2018.
Pending Matters
Congress and the FCC have under consideration, and in the future may consider and adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership, and profitability of our broadcast stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our broadcast stations, and affect our ability to acquire additional broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions.
On November 16, 2017, the FCC adopted a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking authorizing the voluntary deployment of NEXTGEN TV and adopting rules to afford broadcasters flexibility to deploy NEXTGEN TV based transmissions while minimizing impact on consumers and industry stakeholders and seeking comment on certain additional matters. The Report and Order took effect on March 5, 2018, except for certain rules that required approval from the Office of Management and Budget which became effective on July 17, 2018. The public comment period for the proposed rulemaking closed on March 20, 2018, and the rulemaking remains pending. The FCC released a Public Notice on May 23, 2019 announcing that it would begin accepting NEXTGEN TV applications on May 28, 2019.
Other matters that could affect our broadcast properties include technological innovations and developments generally affecting competition in the mass communications industry, such as direct to consumer offerings, direct television broadcast satellite service, Class A television service, the continued establishment of wireless cable systems and low power television stations, digital television technologies, the internet and mobility, and portability of our broadcast signal to hand-held devices.
Congress authorized the FCC to conduct so-called “incentive auctions” to auction and re-purpose broadcast television spectrum for mobile broadband use. In the repacking process associated with the auction, the FCC reassigned some stations to new post-auction channels. Full-power and Class A stations are expected to complete the transition to their post-auction channels in one of ten phases between November 30, 2018 and July 3, 2020. The legislation authorizing the incentive auction provides the FCC with a $1.75 billion fund to reimburse reasonable costs incurred by stations that are reassigned to new channels in the repack. Congress allocated an additional $1 billion to the reimbursement fund in the FCC Reauthorization Act of 2018. See Broadcast Incentive Auction under Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our participation, results, and post-auction process.
On December 13, 2018, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to initiate the 2018 Quadrennial Regulatory Review of the FCC’s broadcast ownership rules, pursuant to the statutory requirement that the FCC review its media ownership rules every four years to determine whether they remain “necessary in the public interest as the result of competition.” The NPRM generally seeks comment on whether the Local Radio Ownership Rule, the Local Television Ownership Rule, and the Dual Network Rule should be retained, modified, or eliminated. With respect to the Local Television Ownership Rule specifically, among other things, the NPRM seeks comment on possible modifications to the rule’s operation, including the relevant product market, the numerical limit, the top-four prohibition; and the implications of multicasting, satellite stations, low power stations and the next generation standard. In addition, the NPRM examines further several diversity related proposals raised in the last quadrennial review proceeding. The public comment period closed on May 29, 2019, and the rulemaking remains pending.
Other Considerations
The preceding summary is not a complete discussion of all provisions of the Communications Act or other congressional acts or of the regulations and policies of the FCC, or in some cases, the DOJ.  For further information, reference should be made to the Communications Act, other congressional acts and regulations, and public notices circulated from time to time by the FCC, or in some cases, the DOJ.  There are additional regulations and policies of the FCC and other federal agencies that govern political broadcasts, advertising, equal employment opportunity, and other matters affecting our business and operations.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

Prior to our ownership or operation of our facilities, substances or waste that are, or might be considered, hazardous under applicable environmental laws may have been generated, used, stored, or disposed of at certain of those facilities.  In addition, environmental conditions relating to the soil and groundwater at or under our facilities may be affected by the proximity of nearby properties that have generated, used, stored, or disposed of hazardous substances.  As a result, it is possible that we could become subject to environmental liabilities in the future in connection with these facilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations.  Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with such environmental requirements and have not in the past been required to incur significant costs in connection therewith, there can be no assurance that our costs to comply with such requirements will not increase in the future or that we will not become subject to new governmental regulations, including those pertaining to potential climate change legislation, that may impose additional restrictions or costs on us.  We presently believe that none of our properties have any condition that is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, or consolidated statements of cash flows.
COMPETITION
Our stations and RSNs compete for audience share and advertising revenue with other television stations and cable networks in their markets, as well as with other advertising media such as MVPDs, OTT, cable networks, video on-demand, radio, newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, telecommunications providers, direct mail, internet, and other digital media. 

Stations and RSNs compete for audience share primarily on the basis of program popularity, which has a direct effect on advertising rates.  
Our network affiliated stations are largely dependent upon the performance of network provided programs in order to attract viewers.  Non-network time periods are programmed by the station primarily with syndicated programs purchased for cash, cash and barter, or barter-only, as well as through self-produced news, public affairs programs, live local sporting events, paid-programming, and other lifestyle and entertainment programming. We also compete for programming which involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming.  Our stations compete for access to those programs against in-market broadcast station competitors for syndicated products and with national cable networks.  Public broadcasting stations generally compete with commercial broadcasters for viewers, but not for advertising dollars.
Competition in the television broadcasting industry occurs primarily in individual DMAs.  Generally, a television broadcasting station in one DMA does not compete with stations in other DMAs.  Our stations are located in highly competitive DMAs.  MVPDs can increase competition for viewership and advertising broadcast television station by carrying bringing into its market additional cable network channels in the same DMA as broadcast television stations.  MVPDs sell advertising on these cable networks to local advertisers. These narrow cable network channels are typically low rated, and, as a result, advertisements are inexpensive to the local advertisers.  MVPDs may also connect two or more cable systems together, also called an interconnect, which gives advertisers the option to reach more households in a market with a single buy. In addition, certain of our DMAs are overlapped by over-the-air stations from adjacent DMAs and MVPDs of stations from other DMAs, which tends to spread viewership and advertising expenditures over a larger number of television stations. In addition, there is significant increased competition with Google, Facebook, OTT offerings and the multitude of other digital offerings that air video advertisements and sell programmatically to agencies and advertisers. MVPDs and digital offerings have the ability to either blanket the market or target their advertising which broadcast stations do not. 
Because the loyalty of the sports viewing audience to a sports programming network is primarily driven by loyalty to a particular team or teams, access to adequate sources of sports programming is critical to the RSNs. The RSNs compete for telecast rights for teams or events with national or regional cable networks that specialize in or carry sports programming; television ‘‘superstations’’ which distribute sports and other programming by satellite; local and national commercial broadcast television networks; independent syndicators that acquire and resell such rights nationally, regionally and locally; mobile internet providers; and other OTT providers. Some of these competitors may own or control, or are owned or controlled by, sports teams, leagues or sports promoters, which gives them an advantage in obtaining telecast rights for such teams or sports. Distributors may also contract directly with the sports teams in their local service areas for the right to distribute games on their systems. The RSNs may also compete with Internet-based distributors of sports programming. The increasing amount of sports programming available on a national basis, including pursuant to national rights arrangements, as part of league-controlled sports networks (e.g., NBA TV and NHL Network), and in out-of-market packages (e.g., NBA’s League Pass and NHL Center Ice), may have an adverse impact on the RSNs' competitive position as they compete for distribution and for viewers.
The RSNs also compete with other programming networks to secure desired programming, although some of the RSNs programming is generated internally through their efforts in original programming. Competition for programming will increase as the number of programming networks increases. Other programming networks that are affiliated with programming sources such as movie or television studios, film libraries or sports teams may have a competitive advantage over the RSNs in this area.

Advertising rates are based upon factors which include the size of the market in which the station and RSN operate; a program or team's popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to attract; the number of advertisers competing for the available time; the demographic makeup of the market served by the station and RSN; the availability of alternative advertising media in the DMA; the aggressiveness and knowledge of the sales forces in the market to call on and understand their client’s need; and development of projects, features, and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming.  We believe that our sales and programming strategies allow us to compete effectively for advertising revenues within the stations' and RSNs' markets.
Further, the competition of obtaining distribution is highly competitive. Our stations and RSNs face competition from other television stations and cable networks for the right to be carried by a particular distributor, and for the right to be carried on the service tier that will attract the most subscribers. Once one of our stations or RSNs obtains distribution, that network competes for viewers not only with the other channels available through the distributor, but also with over-the-air television, pay-per-view channels and video-on-demand channels, as well as online services, mobile services, radio, print, streaming services, and other sources of media and information, sporting events and entertainment. Important to our success in each area of competition the station and RSN faces are the price the station or RSN charges for its carriage; the quantity, quality and variety of programming offered and the effectiveness of its marketing efforts.
Our stations' and RSNs' ability to successfully compete with other television stations and cable networks for distribution may be hampered because the distributors, through which distribution is sought, may be affiliated with other television stations or cable networks. Those distributors may place their affiliated television station or cable network on a more desirable tier, thereby giving the affiliated television station or cable network a competitive advantage over our stations' or RSNs' own programming. 
Our stations and RSNs are continuously faced with technical changes and innovations, competing entertainment and communications media, changes in labor conditions, and governmental restrictions or actions of federal regulatory bodies, including the FCC, any of which could possibly have a material effect on a television station’s operations and profits. 

Moreover, technology advances and regulatory changes affecting programming delivery through fiber optic lines, video compression, and new wireless uses could lower entry barriers for new video channels and encourage the further development of increasingly specialized “niche” programming.  Telephone companies are permitted to provide video distribution services, on a common carrier basis, as “cable systems” or as “open video systems,” each pursuant to different regulatory schemes.  Additionally, OTT services allow consumers to consume programming on-demand through access to the internet and without a subscription with an MVPD. We continue to compete with the OTT services for viewership.
DTV technology allows our stations to provide viewers multiple channels of digital television over each of our existing standard digital channels, to provide certain programming in HD television format and to deliver other channels of information in the forms of data and programming to the internet, PCs, smart phones, tablet computers, and mobile and streaming devices.  These additional capabilities may provide us with additional sources of revenue, as well as additional competition.
The financial success of our stations' and RSNs' also depends in part upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, the strength of the advertising market, the quality and appeal of the competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities.
We believe we compete favorably against other television stations and cable networks because of our management skill and experience, our ability historically to generate revenue share greater than our audience share, our network affiliations and program service arrangements, and our local program acceptance.  In addition, we believe that we benefit from the operation of multiple broadcast and network properties, affording us certain non-quantifiable economies of scale and competitive advantages in the purchase of programming.
