Item 1 | BUSINESS.

General
References to “Brinker,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in this Form 10-K are references to Brinker International, Inc. and its subsidiaries and any predecessor companies of Brinker International, Inc.
We own, develop, operate and franchise the Chili’s® Grill & Bar (“Chili’s”) and Maggiano’s Little Italy® (“Maggiano’s”) restaurant brands. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in September 1983 to succeed to the business operated by Chili’s, Inc., a Texas corporation, which was organized in August 1977. We completed the acquisition of Maggiano’s in August 1995. 
Restaurant Brands
Chili’s Grill & Bar
Chili’s, a recognized leader in the Bar & Grill category of casual dining, has been operating restaurants for over 40 years. Chili’s enjoys a global presence with locations in 31 countries and two U.S. territories. Whether domestic or international, company-owned or franchised, Chili’s and its more than 100,000 team members are dedicated to delivering fresh, high-quality food with a unique point of view, as well as dining experiences that make people feel special. Historically, Chili’s menu has featured bold, kicked-up American favorites, and in recent years we have expanded our menu to include more Fresh Mex and Fresh Tex offerings. However, casual dining traffic has softened, and we believe the next generation of American consumers demand more quality and focused expertise in their restaurant offerings. We are reinvesting in the core menu platforms that first established Chili’s reputation more than 40 years ago. These include burgers, ribs and fajitas, as well as our famous margaritas. We are reinvesting in each of these platforms for a new generation of guests. We believe our focused menu will allow Chili’s to differentiate our food from other restaurants.
We also believe that guests are evolving not only their standards of quality but also their expectations of convenience. Chili’s to-go menu is available on-line, by calling the restaurant, or through our new mobile app, and in the spring of 2017, we began offering “call ahead carryout” through an app in all our company-owned restaurants. In recent years, we also pioneered the use of tabletop devices inside the restaurants, which allow guests to order and re-order menu items, enjoy entertainment and assert more control over their dining experience by paying through the tabletop device when they choose.
During the fiscal year ended June 28, 2017, at our company-owned restaurants, entrée selections ranged in menu price from $6.00 to $18.99. The average revenue per meal, including alcoholic beverages, was approximately $15.26 per person. During this same year, food and

non-alcoholic beverage sales constituted approximately 85.9% of Chili’s total restaurant revenues, with alcoholic beverage sales accounting for the remaining 14.1%. Our average annual sales volume per company-owned Chili’s restaurant during this same year was $2.9 million.
Maggiano’s Little Italy
Maggiano’s is a full-service, national, casual dining Italian restaurant brand with a passion for making people feel special. The exterior of each Maggiano’s restaurant varies to reflect local architecture; however, the interior of all locations transport our guests back to a classic Italian-American restaurant in the style of New York’s Little Italy in the 1940s. Our Maggiano’s restaurants feature individual and family-style menus, and most of our restaurants also have extensive banquet facilities designed to host large party business or social events. We have a full lunch and dinner menu offering chef-prepared, classic Italian-American fare in the form of appetizers and entrées with bountiful portions of pasta, chicken, seafood, veal, prime steaks and desserts. In February 2017, we also began offering weekend brunch. Our Maggiano’s restaurants also offer a full range of alcoholic beverages, including a selection of handcrafted classic cocktails and premium wines. In addition, Maggiano’s offers a full carryout menu as well as local delivery services.
During the fiscal year ended June 28, 2017, entrée selections ranged in menu price from $13.95 to $47.95. The average revenue per meal, including alcoholic beverages, was approximately $27.89 per person. During this same year, food and non-alcoholic beverage sales constituted approximately 84.4% of Maggiano’s total restaurant revenues, with alcoholic beverage sales accounting for the remaining 15.6%. Sales from events at our banquet facilities made up 18.1% of Maggiano's total restaurant revenues for the year. Our average annual sales volume per Maggiano’s restaurant during this same year was $8.3 million.
Business Strategy
We are committed to strategies and initiatives that we believe are centered on long-term sales and profit growth, enhancing the guest experience and team member engagement. These strategies are intended to differentiate our brands from the competition, reduce the costs associated with managing our restaurants and establish a strong presence for our brands in key markets around the world.
Growing sales and traffic continues to be a challenge with increasing competition and heavy discounting in the casual dining industry. Lower oil prices have continued to negatively impact sales in our markets with oil dependent economies. We also believe that casual dining traffic was negatively impacted by lower retail traffic in general, including during the December, 2016 holiday season. U.S. economic growth has been steady in recent years, but wage growth has been slow comparative to the post-recession economic recovery. This wage pressure and increased costs for healthcare has challenged both casual dining restaurant operators and consumers as discretionary income available for restaurant visits has been limited. More consumers are opting to eat at home as the decline in grocery costs relative to casual dining prices allows consumers to save money. Consumers are also taking advantage of discounted fast food options which has placed additional pressure on the casual dining sector. Overall, the industry was softer than we anticipated this year. In response to these economic factors and industry pressures, we have developed both short and long-term strategies that we believe are appropriate for all operating conditions and will provide a solid foundation for future earnings growth. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we completed a reorganization of the Chili's restaurant operations team and certain departments at the corporate headquarters to better align staffing with our current strategies. This reorganization resulted in pre-tax savings of over $5 million in fiscal year 2017. We anticipate pre-tax savings of approximately $12 million on an annualized basis. 
We regularly evaluate our processes and menu at Chili's to identify opportunities where we can improve our service quality and food. We made a commitment to simplify our menu and back of house complexity by reducing the number of menu items. We believe this initiative will improve kitchen efficiency and result in meals being delivered hotter and faster to our guests. During fiscal year 2017, we upgraded the quality of our chicken crispers to an all-natural chicken and added new flavors such as buffalo bleu cheese crispers and honey chipotle chicken and waffles. We also implemented a new "smash" burger cooking procedure across our burger platform that produces a juicier product and cuts the cooking time nearly in half. We believe that guests are responding favorably to the new products. We were also pleased with the guest preference results from the smokehouse platform added to the menu in fiscal year 2017, which features jalapeño cheese sausage, bone-in chicken and our signature baby-back ribs. Additionally, we launched our new line of craft beers in fiscal year 2017 featuring regional and national favorites and our Presidente Margarita on tap. 
We remain competitive with our value offerings at both lunch and dinner and are committed to offering consistent, quality products at a compelling every day value. We offered a promotional "3 for Me™" platform in January 2017 that allowed guests to combine a salad and mini molten dessert with their choice of fajitas, burgers, smoked chicken or ribs for just $10.00. We will continue to seek opportunities to reinforce value and create interest for the Chili's brand with new and varied offerings to further enhance sales and drive incremental traffic.
The Chili’s brand has leveraged technology initiatives to create a digital guest experience that we believe will help us engage our guests more effectively. We have launched a new online ordering system that expands our current capabilities and gives our guests greater control of their to-go experience. Our upgraded Chili’s mobile app provides the capability for digital curbside service where guests can order, pay and notify us of their arrival all through the app. We have leveraged our tabletop technology to power our loyalty programs and anticipate that guest 
3

loyalty programs will be a significant part of our marketing strategy going forward. We believe guest loyalty programs allow us to drive sales by creating more relevant and customized incentives for our guests.
We believe that improvements at Chili's will have the most significant impact on the business; however, our results will also benefit through additional contributions from Maggiano's and our global business. Maggiano's opened two restaurants in fiscal year 2017 based on our new prototype, which includes a flexible dining area that may be used for banquets or opened up for general seating. This new prototype allows the brand to enter new markets for which the prior model was not suited, but still accommodate smaller banquets. We introduced a new menu at Maggiano’s in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 that includes the addition of Saturday and Sunday brunch, and we believe guests are responding favorably to the new menu and brunch offering. Maggiano's is committed to delivering high quality food and a dining experience in line with this brand's heritage. 
Our global Chili's business continues to grow with locations in 30 countries and two territories outside of the United States. Our international franchisees opened 30 new restaurants in fiscal year 2017.
Company Development
Over the past fiscal year we continued the expansion of our restaurant brands domestically through a select number of new company-owned restaurants in strategically desirable markets. We concentrate on the development of certain identified markets that are most likely to improve our competitive position and achieve the desired level of marketing potential, profitability and return on invested capital. Our domestic expansion efforts focus not only on major metropolitan areas in the United States but also on smaller market areas and non-traditional locations (such as airports and universities) that can adequately support our restaurant brands. For smaller market areas, we have developed a newer smaller prototype building that allows us to expand into these markets and serve our guests while maintaining a focus on profitability and return on invested capital.
The restaurant site selection process is critical, and we devote significant effort to the investigation of new locations utilizing a variety of sophisticated analytical techniques. Our process evaluates a variety of factors, including: trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels; physical site characteristics, such as visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; relative proximity to activity centers, such as shopping centers, hotel and entertainment complexes and office buildings; and supply and demand trends, such as proposed infrastructure improvements, new developments and existing and potential competition. Members of each brand’s executive team inspect, review and approve each restaurant site prior to its lease or acquisition for that brand.
The specific rate at which we are able to open new restaurants is determined, in part, by our success in locating satisfactory sites, negotiating acceptable lease or purchase terms, securing appropriate local governmental permits and approvals, and by our capacity to supervise construction and recruit and train management and hourly team members.
The following table illustrates the system-wide restaurants opened in fiscal year 2017 and the projected openings in fiscal 2018:


 | Fiscal 2017Openings | Fiscal 2018Projected Openings
Chili’s domestic: | | 
Company-owned | 7 | 5-6 
Franchise | 6 | 6-8 
Maggiano’s: | | 
Company-owned | 2 | 1 
Chili's international: | | 
Company-owned | 1 | 0 
Franchise | 30 | 38-43 
Total | 46 | 50-58 

We periodically re-evaluate company-owned restaurant sites to ensure attributes have not deteriorated below our minimum standards. In the event site deterioration occurs, each brand makes a concerted effort to improve the restaurant’s performance by providing physical, operating and marketing enhancements unique to each restaurant’s situation. If efforts to restore the restaurant’s performance to acceptable minimum standards are unsuccessful, the brand considers relocation to a proximate, more desirable site, or evaluates closing the restaurant if the brand’s measurement criteria, such as return on investment and area demographic trends, do not support relocation. We closed eight company-owned restaurants in fiscal year 2017 that were generally performing below our standards or were near or at the expiration of their lease terms. If local market conditions warrant, we also opportunistically evaluate company-owned restaurants to determine if relocation to a proximate, more desirable site will strengthen our presence in those trade areas or markets. We relocated one company-owned restaurant in 
4

fiscal year 2017. Our strategic plan is targeted to support our long-term growth objectives, with a focus on continued development of those restaurant locations that have the greatest return potential for the Company and our shareholders.
Franchise Development
In addition to our development of company-owned restaurants, our restaurant brands pursue expansion through our franchisees and joint venture partners. 
As part of our strategy to expand through our franchisees, our franchise operated locations increased in fiscal year 2017. The following table illustrates the percentages of franchise operations as of June 28, 2017 for the Company and by restaurant brand, respectively:

 | Percentage of FranchiseOperated Restaurants
 | Domestic(1) | | International(2) | | Overall(3)
Brinker | 24 | % | | 96 | % | 40 | %
Chili’s | 25 | % | | 96 | % | 41 | %
Maggiano’s | — | % | | — | % | — | %

____________________________________________________________________

(1) | The percentages in this column are based on number of domestic franchised restaurants versus total domestic restaurants.


(2) | The percentages in this column are based on number of international franchised restaurants versus total international restaurants. Restaurants operated by our Mexican joint venture are included as international franchised restaurants. 


(3) | The percentages in this column are based on the total number of franchised restaurants (domestic and international) versus total system-wide number of restaurants.

International
We continue our international growth through development agreements with new and existing franchisees and joint venture partners, introducing Chili’s to new countries and expanding the brand within our existing markets. As of June 28, 2017, we had 24 total development arrangements. During fiscal year 2017, our international franchisees and joint venture partners opened 30 Chili’s restaurants. We entered into new development agreements with new and existing franchisees for development in Mexico, Peru and Vietnam.
As we develop Chili’s internationally, we will selectively pursue expansion through various means, including franchising, joint ventures and acquisitions. Our international agreements provide the vehicle for payment of development fees and initial franchise fees in addition to subsequent royalty fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. We expect future agreements to remain limited to enterprises who demonstrate a proven track record as a restaurant operator and showcase financial strength that can support a multi-unit development agreement.
Domestic
We remain committed to also growing our number of domestic franchised restaurants. We plan to accomplish this through existing, new or renewed development and franchise agreements with new or existing franchisees. In addition, we have from time to time also sold and may sell company-owned restaurants to our franchisees (new or existing). As of June 28, 2017, four domestic development arrangements existed. Similar to our international agreements, a typical domestic agreement provides for payment of development and initial franchise fees in addition to subsequent royalty and advertising fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. We expect future domestic agreements to remain limited to enterprises having significant experience as restaurant operators and proven financial ability to support and develop multi-unit operations.
During the year ended June 28, 2017, our domestic franchisees opened six Chili's restaurants.
Restaurant Management
Our Chili’s and Maggiano’s brands have separate designated teams who support each brand, including operations, finance, franchise, marketing, peopleworks and culinary. We believe these strategic, brand-focused teams foster the identities of the individual and uniquely positioned brands. To maximize efficiencies, brands continue to utilize common and shared infrastructure, including, among other services, accounting, information technology, purchasing, legal and restaurant development.
At the restaurant level, management structure varies by brand. A typical restaurant is led by a management team including a general manager, two to six additional managers, and for Maggiano’s, an additional three to four chefs. The level of restaurant supervision depends upon the operating complexity and sales volume of individual locations.

We believe there is a high correlation between the quality of restaurant management and the long-term success of a brand. In that regard, we encourage increased experience at all management positions through various short and long-term incentive programs, which may include equity ownership. These programs, coupled with a general management philosophy emphasizing quality of life, have enabled us to attract and retain key team members, and enjoy turnover of managers and team members that is below industry averages.
We ensure consistent quality standards in our brands through the issuance of operations manuals covering all elements of operations and food and beverage manuals, which provide guidance for preparation of brand-formulated recipes. Routine visitation to the restaurants by all levels of supervision enforces strict adherence to our overall brand standards and operating procedures. Each brand is responsible for maintaining their operational training program. Depending on the brand, the training program typically includes a training period of two to three months for restaurant management trainees, as well as special training for high-potential managers. We also provide recurring management training for managers and supervisors to improve effectiveness or prepare them for more responsibility.
Supply Chain
Our ability to maintain consistent quality and continuity of supply throughout each restaurant brand depends upon acquiring products from reliable sources. Our approved suppliers and our restaurants are required to adhere to strict product and safety specifications established through our quality assurance and culinary programs. These requirements are intended to ensure high-quality products are served in each of our restaurants. We strategically negotiate directly with major suppliers to obtain competitive prices. We also use purchase commitment contracts when appropriate to stabilize the potentially volatile pricing associated with certain commodity items. All essential products are available from pre-qualified distributors to be delivered to our restaurant brands. Additionally, as a purchaser of a variety of food products, we require our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct, which sets forth our expectation on business integrity, food safety and food ingredients, animal welfare and sustainability. Due to the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants, which consist primarily of food, beverages and supplies, have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to revenues. Internationally, our franchisees and joint venture operations may encounter cultural and regulatory differences resulting in variances with product specifications for international restaurant locations.
Advertising and Marketing
As a “polished casual” restaurant, with just more than 50 locations, Maggiano’s primarily targets affluent baby boomers who live and work around the higher-end malls where the majority of Maggiano’s restaurants are located. Maggiano’s relies primarily on direct marketing, social media and word of mouth to advertise to new guests. As a large, nationally penetrated bar and grill brand, Chili’s appeals to a broader population. More than 50 million Americans visit Chili’s every three months, ranging across all income and ethnic groups. As casual-dining traffic has softened in recent years, we have worked hard to be more precise in defining the Chili’s guest target. Today our primary focus for developing menu innovation and targeting our TV and digital advertising are the Generation X and young millennial families who desire quality food, good value and a service experience that allows them to connect with family and friends. These young families represent a significant percentage of our guest base today and, we believe, will only grow in importance in the years ahead.
Our franchise agreements generally require advertising contributions to us by the franchisees. We use these contributions, in conjunction with company funds, for the purpose of retaining advertising agencies, obtaining consumer insights, developing and producing brand-specific creative materials and purchasing national or regional media to meet the brand’s strategy. Some franchisees also spend additional amounts on local advertising. Any such local advertising is required to be approved by us.
Team Members
As of June 28, 2017, we employed 57,906 team members, of which 581 were restaurant support center personnel in Dallas, and 4,416 were restaurant regional and area directors, managers, or trainees. The remaining 52,909 were employed in non-management restaurant positions. Our executive officers have an average of 23 years of experience in the restaurant industry.
We have a positive team member relations outlook and continue to focus on improving our team member turnover rate. We have a variety of tools and strong resources in place to help us recruit and retain the best talent to work in our restaurants.
The majority of our team members, outside of restaurant management and restaurant support center personnel, are paid on an hourly basis. We stand firm in the belief that we provide competitive working conditions and wages favorable with other companies in our industry. Our team members are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
Trademarks
We have registered or have pending, among other marks, “Brinker International”, “Chili’s”, “Chili’s Southwest Grill & Bar”, “Chili’s Too”, “Maggiano’s”, and “Maggiano’s Little Italy”, as trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
