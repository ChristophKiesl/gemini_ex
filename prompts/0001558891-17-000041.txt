Item 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
UpperSolution.com is incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on April 20, 2013 and our fiscal year end is May 31, and we have no subsidiaries.
 
Our business is to create an independent and unbiased mobile app that enables consumers to find the best cellular rate plan for their need and getting real-time notifications when a new cellular plan is available.
 
We are in the development stage of developing and commercializing a mobile app for existing cellular phone users. Our goal is to help consumers to save money each month by notifying them when a more cost-effective plan based on their actual usage is available.
 
Our mobile app, to be named “Upper Plan Monitor (“UPM”)”, will help consumers to keep track on new cellular plans from different cellular carriers, locate the closest phone dealer their your area, find the best cellular phone plan that fit their needs.
 
Once developed, UPM will eliminate the need to manually check if a better cellular phone plan is available with the current cellular carrier or other cellular carriers. Convenience and money-savings will be our main selling features. We plan to develop UPM for the Apple's iPhone phones, in the future if resources we allow us we will develop an app for an Android based mobile phones.
 
When a user launches the UPM app for the first time on his phone, he will be asked to select his existing cellular plan from a pre-loaded list, in case that the user can’t find his cellular plan he will be able to enter his existing cellular plan by minutes, data and text message. Then the user will be asked to choose what is the most important to him in a cellular plan, and rate 3 features: talk, data and text. At this point UPM will gather this information and build a profile on the user based on his existing cellular phone plan and his own preferences. The last step will be to choose the carriers he would like to get notifications when new plans are available.
 
UPM will run in the background and automatically checks if a new cellular plan is available, in case that a new plan is available it will match the 3 parameters (talk, data and text messages) to the users existing plan. In the case that the new plan is better or cheaper than the current plan a pop-up notification will appear on the user’s screen to notify him.
 
At this stage in our development, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in generating revenues from our app or that existing phone users will be receptive to our application.
 
Revenue Model
 
We plan to generate revenue from the following sources:
 
Sale of UPM
 
We plan to sell UPM on Apple’s App Store site, for $1.99. Apple takes 30 percent of all revenue generated through apps, and 70 percent goes to the app publisher.
 
In-App Ads
 
One of the major benefits of advertising on an app is that advertisers can take advantage of the users' geographic and demographic information and target their ads appropriately. We plan to use Admob by Google as a way to insert advertisements into our app. AdMob is one of the world's largest mobile advertising networks, and offers the ability for app developers to earn revenue by publishing ads in their software. Revenue is generated according to the PPC (Pay Per Click) model, where advertisers pay the hosting service a flat rate each time the ad is clicked.

MARKETING & SALES STRATEGY
 
We plan for our app to be marketed on five fronts:
 
* Social Media: We intend to spread word of UPM through popular social network platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, blogs etc. We will create forums for users to engage with and support our product, such as a facebook fan page, blog entries and tweets that followers can re-post or link to.
 
* App review websites: Send out promo keys to app review websites and blogs such as www.appvee.com, www.androinica.com, www.techcrunch.com and www.macworld.com.
 
* "Send-it-to-your-friend" linkage: UPM standard "send it to your friend" link will enable for consumers to send it to their colleagues or recommend it for download.
 
* Advertising: We plan to advertise on mobile ad networks, such as Admob, Quattro, and Millenial Media. Mobile ad networks can target users by country, device, and category.
 
* Press Releases: We will send out a press release in order get UPM noticed by the traditional media - newspapers and magazines.
