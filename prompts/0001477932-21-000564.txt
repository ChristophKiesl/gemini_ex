ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
 
Fresh Harvest Products, Inc. (the “Parent Company”) is a corporation formed in the State of New Jersey. Until October of 2012, we operated as a natural and organic food products company before management decided to transition the Company’s line of business to capitalize on its relationships within the rapidly growing Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), enterprise software and mobile application markets. The Company is engaged in the software and mobile application development and video production businesses. 
 
During October 2012, the Parent Company began integrating a digital plan and strategy which shifted the Company’s focus to expanding the online network and community, as well as an expansion of online services, with a focus on developing various SaaS models in the health, wellness, fitness, lifestyles of health and sustainability (LOHAS) and healthcare industries.
 
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2013, we did not generate any revenues as we were integrating our new business model, and developing software products. The Company was in development of a calorie calculator and comparison operator for web and mobile applications, as well as other related software.
 
The Company expects to develop, license and acquire software applications that will generate revenue through subscription fees, in-app upgrades, purchases and advertising. The Company is currently working on several software applications including a calorie calculator and food comparison software solution so that consumers can be informed and compare what foods they are eating and be able to accurately calculate their daily calories per item, as well as compare foods with each other to learn and understand what the healthier options are. The Company is actively seeking strategic partners and acquisition targets in order to grow and expand.
 
The Company continues to have limited capital resources and has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations and expects these conditions to continue for the foreseeable future. As of October 31, 2013, the Company had no cash available for operations and had an accumulated deficit of $9,885,044. Management believes that cash on hand as of October 31, 2013 is not sufficient to fund operations through October 31, 2014. The Company will be required to raise additional funds to meet its short and long-term planned goals. There can be no assurance that such funds, if available at all, can be obtained on terms reasonable to the Company.
 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has limited revenue and without realization of additional capital, it would be highly unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. 
 
Since October 31, 2012, the Company has engaged in the software and mobile application development and video production businesses.
