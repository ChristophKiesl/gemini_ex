Item 1. Business
OUR BUSINESS
We founded DoorDash to be a merchant-first business. Our mission is to grow and empower local economies. 
Technology has changed consumer behavior and driven a wave of demand for convenience. Consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy with every purchase has been a boon for some companies but damaging for many others. We enable local brick-and-mortar businesses—which are fundamental to the vitality of local economies and communities—to address consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy and thrive in an increasingly convenience-driven economy. Our local logistics platform connects over 450,000 merchants, over 20 million consumers, and over 1 million Dashers in the United States, Canada, and Australia every month.
We built our products to serve the needs of these three key constituencies. We do this primarily through the DoorDash Marketplace, or our Marketplace, which offers a broad array of services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach. It generates significant demand for merchants by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants can fulfill this demand through delivery, facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by consumers. 
In addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our business today, we offer merchants a variety of products, which we refer to as merchant services, to facilitate sales that merchants have originated through their own channels. DoorDash Drive, or Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants that have generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our local logistics platform. DoorDash Storefront, or Storefront, enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.
THE DOORDASH PLATFORM
Our local logistics platform connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. We built our local logistics platform to serve the needs of these three key constituencies and to become more intelligent and efficient with every order. As we have grown, the scale of our local logistics platform has become one of our major competitive advantages and delivers substantial benefits to everyone we serve. We connect:
•Merchants: Over 450,000 merchants run and grow their businesses using our technology platform. Our products are designed to meet the individual needs of merchants, regardless of their scale, business model, or location. Our Marketplace includes business enablement and demand fulfillment services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. We help our merchants thrive in an increasingly convenience-driven economy while enabling them to focus on their craft.
•Consumers: Over 20 million consumers discover, engage with, and purchase goods from merchants on our local logistics platform. For consumers, we offer the ability to order from the best of their communities with the click of a button and to have their orders reliably delivered or waiting at the store for pickup. We enable convenience for consumers throughout their entire day, from breakfast pickup on-the-go to catered lunch at work to grocery or dinner delivery straight to their doorsteps. We believe that the convenient access we provide to an unmatched

combination of selection, experience, and value for consumers helps drive consumer engagement and category-leading spend retention.4
•Dashers: Over 1 million Dashers use our local logistics platform to find opportunities to earn. For Dashers, we provide opportunities for those looking for a fast and flexible way to earn and to achieve their goals. We also provide earnings transparency so that Dashers can make informed decisions about the deliveries they choose to make. Dashers set their own schedules and we work to ensure that the time they spend making deliveries is well rewarded. We do not require Dashers to deliver by car as they also have the option to deliver by bike or scooter, enabling a broad range of people to deliver on our platform.
Our local logistics platform benefits from three powerful virtuous cycles:
•Local Network Effects: Our ability to attract more merchants, including local favorites and national brands, creates more selection in our Marketplace, driving more consumer engagement, and in turn, more sales for merchants on our platform. Our strong national merchant footprint enables us to launch new markets and quickly establish a critical mass of merchants and Dashers, driving strong consumer adoption.
•Economies of Scale: As more consumers join our local logistics platform and their engagement increases, our entire platform benefits from higher order volume, which means more revenue for local businesses and more opportunities for Dashers to work and increase their earnings. This, in turn, attracts Dashers to our local logistics platform, which allows for faster and more efficient fulfillment of orders for consumers.
•Increasing Brand Affinity: Both our local network effects and economies of scale lead to more merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our local logistics platform. As we scale, we continue to invest in improving our offerings for merchants, selection, experience, and value for consumers, and earnings opportunities for Dashers. By improving the benefits of our local logistics platform for each of our three constituencies, our network continues to grow and we benefit from increased brand awareness and positive brand affinity. With increased brand affinity, we expect that we will enjoy lower acquisition costs for all three constituencies in the long term.
Since our founding, over 1.2 billion orders have been completed through our platform. These orders inform our machine learning algorithms and generate a data advantage in which the technology and value of our local logistics platform is 
4 Edison Trends. Based on the estimated dollar value of orders placed on DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats by a group of users that first placed an order on any such platform between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, as determined by Edison Trends. For each platform, spend retention represents the total dollar value of orders placed by this group of users in their twelfth month on the platform as a percentage of the total dollar value of orders placed by such group in their first month. Postmates is excluded due to inconsistent data availability in April and May 2020; however, Postmates’ spend retention was lower than DoorDash in all other months of the measurement period.

continuously enhanced as more constituencies are connected in our network and greater amounts of data are brought into our platform. We leverage insights from this data to drive actionable recommendations for merchants regarding consumer preferences and market trends. For example, as merchants think about growth and expansion, our data insights can help guide their decisions on menu options, hours of operation, and where to build their next storefront. Our data insights also give us unique visibility into the operations of the local businesses in our network. For example, understanding the differences in kitchen preparation time for a sandwich versus sushi enables us to improve Dasher efficiency and improve the consumer experience. As more orders are completed on our local logistics platform, our data insights grow and continue to enhance the experience for all three constituencies, which in turn strengthens our competitive advantage.
OUR GROWTH STRATEGY
We intend to broaden our network of merchants by providing innovative services that help merchants operate and grow their businesses.
•More merchants. We have experienced tremendous success serving merchants, primarily in the food vertical. We have over 450,000 merchants, the majority of which are restaurants, on our local logistics platform today, and there are many more that we have yet to reach. We will continue to invest in our go-to-market strategy and sales efforts to continue adding new merchants. Over time, we plan to continue adding more merchants from verticals outside of food as well as DashMarts, our first party owned-and-operated convenience stores.
•More merchant services. We provide a range of products and services, such as our Marketplace, Drive, and Storefront, to help our merchants operate and grow their businesses. We will continue to innovate and introduce new products and services to add value for our merchants and unlock additional revenue opportunities for DoorDash.
We seek to increase consumer adoption and have DoorDash become a daily activity.
•More consumers. There are over 20 million consumers on our local logistics platform. We plan to continue to increase our consumer reach, both in the United States and internationally. We launched in Australia, in September 2019, and have a strong and growing business in Canada.
•More consumer engagement. Today, consumers use our local logistics platform for a small fraction of their monthly meals. In the food vertical, we strive to increase the frequency with which consumers use DoorDash by being the most delicious, affordable, and convenient way to eat. We plan to do this by increasing the breadth of restaurant selection, expanding availability of meals at all times of the day, addressing the needs of business consumers via DoorDash for Work, which includes large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events, and enhancing affordability by increasing adoption of DashPass, our subscription product, which eliminates per-order delivery fees with partner merchants. We will also continue to seek partnership opportunities to extend the benefits of DashPass to more consumers. In addition, as we continue to add new verticals beyond food, we expect to further increase the amount of consumer spend on our platform and broaden the benefits of DashPass.
We seek to build a reliable, high quality, and operationally efficient logistics network.
•Better consumer experience. Our goal is to delight consumers, thereby promoting their use of our platform and making it easier for us to acquire new consumers. We continue to make investments aimed at improving the consumer experience. We are particularly focused on building tools to help Dashers improve the accuracy of items delivered and the speed and timeliness of delivery, without sacrificing selection.
•Better Dasher experience. We also invest in improving Dasher experience and satisfaction. This includes improving onboarding and enabling Dashers to sign up and start earning faster. For example, we developed our local logistics platform to provide earnings visibility after every delivery in an easy and transparent manner, and through our Fast Pay service, we enable Dashers to receive their earnings on-demand, rather than on a weekly basis.
•Improve operational efficiency. We are focused on optimizing our cost structure primarily through product improvements meant to enhance the operational efficiency and quality of our local logistics platform. These improvements include enhancements to our batching algorithms and order preparation and traffic predictions.
OUR OFFERINGS
Table of Contents

Our offerings provide merchants, consumers, and Dashers with a local logistics platform that offers access to convenience and opportunity.
Offerings for Merchants
We have carefully designed our local logistics platform with a merchant-first approach. Our merchant services include business enablement and demand fulfillment services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. Our local logistics platform provides merchants with the mission-critical capabilities needed to meet the demands of the convenience economy and capture the business growth that comes from this new wave of demand.
•Merchant tablet and software portal. Partner merchants use our tablets and our merchant software portal for holistic views of their businesses. Our self-service capabilities enable merchants to directly onboard to our local logistics platform and monitor their businesses in real time.
Merchant services that we offer for demand fulfillment include:
•Marketplace. Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach. It generates significant demand for merchants by connecting them with over 20 million consumers. Merchants can fulfill this demand through delivery, facilitated by our local logistics platform, or by taking advantage of in-person pickup or self-delivery, as described below. As part of our Marketplace, we also offer:
◦Pickup. Pickup allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders conveniently with no consumer fees. We believe Pickup generates additional foot traffic for our merchants and drives incremental sales.
◦DoorDash for Work. DoorDash for Work provides our merchants with large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events. Merchants benefit from such orders due to their large dollar value, which helps drive profitability, and the advance nature of such orders, which helps merchants plan better.
◦Self-Delivery. Self-Delivery enables merchants on our Marketplace to fulfill orders with their own delivery fleets.
•Drive. Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants to fulfill consumer demand that they have already created through their own channels but do not have the in-house distribution capacity to fulfill. Many national merchants, such as Chipotle, Wingstop, and Little Caesars, invest significant capital in building their own mobile applications and websites to enable consumers to interact with their brands and order online. These merchants need the ability to address the off-premise consumer demand they have created without having to build and manage their own logistics operations. Through Drive, merchants are able to connect with Dashers and leverage our local logistics platform to fulfill their orders.
•DoorDash Storefront. Storefront enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.
Our Marketplace includes a variety of services, beyond demand fulfillment, that enable merchants’ businesses:
•Customer acquisition. DoorDash connects merchants with over 20 million consumers. Merchants can also use DoorDash to initiate and run promotions to attract new consumers and drive incremental sales. 
•Consumer engagement. We provide merchants with the tools to attract and engage consumers or win back consumers who have not ordered from them recently. Merchants can also feature new items or details about their individual stores.
•Merchandising strategy and personalization. Our merchandising strategy allows us to feature certain merchants or products. For example, we often curate and feature “Local Picks” prominently to showcase new merchants or recent trends. Our machine learning algorithms further personalize selection based on individual consumer order patterns and other factors.
•Payment processing. DoorDash handles payment acceptance from consumers primarily through a third-party payment processor that manages credit card transaction processing, which means merchants do not need to be concerned with credit card authorization, chargebacks, or fraud. Partner merchants and Dashers have accounts directly with the payment processor and we remit payments to merchants and Dashers through the payment processor. When Dashers pick up from a non-partner merchant, they are authorized to pay for the purchased goods with a DoorDash-issued debit card.
Table of Contents

•Self-service. Merchants are able to use the merchant software portal and our Merchant Tablet Order Manager to self-edit menus, update business hours and pricing, and provide additional information about their businesses.
•Insights and analytics. Our merchant software portal allows merchants to track business performance on a number of metrics, including how long a Dasher waits for an order, order accuracy, analyses on top-performing items, and reports on incremental sales. Merchants can use this information to more effectively manage their operational processes and inventory and price items at competitive rates. The data we track enables insights that help merchants understand their consumer base, identify new ways to drive business, and improve the quality of the delivery experience.
•Customer support. We provide customer support for any orders placed through our local logistics platform. Our customer support centers address both order and logistics issues, and we work together with merchants, consumers, and Dashers to resolve disputes.
•Integrations. DoorDash seamlessly integrates with merchants’ existing systems and workflows to streamline operations. Integration with merchant POS systems not only eliminates the need for merchants to monitor and maintain a tablet but also helps improve the delivery experience. For example, merchants with POS integration generally experience a reduction in how long a Dasher waits for an order and the number of missing or incorrect items in an order. We are also able to integrate into existing workflows through which merchants receive their orders, including website, email, tablet, phone, and fax. We do this because we are a merchant-first company and strive to integrate seamlessly with our merchants’ existing operational processes.
Offerings for Consumers
For consumers, our local logistics platform serves as a search engine to the local economy. Our consumer offerings provide a frictionless and personalized experience to search, discover, and order from local businesses. Both our consumer mobile application and website help consumers decide what to order with relevant information about each merchant, visually-rich photos, and filters to make it simple and efficient to find the right merchants and items.
•Consumer mobile application and website. Our consumer mobile application and website provide consumers with access to a wide selection of merchants in our Marketplace. Consumers can search by delivery time, price, rating, and other categories (such as type of cuisine for restaurant merchants) to find the merchant and items that satisfy their needs. Consumers can also easily browse merchants around them to discover new merchants or goods that cater to their preferences. Our proprietary technology enhances the consumer experience by displaying merchants according to a consumer’s preferences and other factors such as delivery times and ratings. Our ability to serve consumers with a personalized selection of merchants that reflects our understanding of their preferences allows us to enable the discovery and curation of merchants for our consumers. We also enable consumers to place orders individually as well as order as a group.
Once a merchant is selected, consumers can customize orders according to their preferences. Our mobile application and website provide real-time notifications and order tracking so that consumers can closely follow their orders from the moment they are placed to when they are delivered. We also offer consumers the ability to easily contact Dashers, and vice-versa, to ensure a seamless delivery experience. Our local logistics platform also allows consumers to easily contact our support team so that issues are efficiently resolved, which provides the ability for us to turn a problem into an opportunity to engage and build loyalty with consumers.
•DashPass. Our subscription product, DashPass, serves as a membership program to the physical world and offers consumers unlimited access to eligible merchants with $0 delivery fees and reduced service fees on eligible orders. DashPass currently costs $9.99 per month for a monthly membership. DashPass enables us to reward our most engaged consumers with savings on the cost of delivery and to reward DashPass-eligible merchants by featuring them to our most engaged consumers. 
•Pickup. Pickup allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines and save time, and pick up items directly from the merchant.
Offerings for Dashers
Underpinning our offerings for Dashers is our proprietary technology that enables Dashers to work where, when, and how they want while keeping them busy so they can earn more money in less time.
•We enable Dashers to easily sign up anytime and anywhere. After clearing a background check, new Dashers can quickly and easily onboard onto our local logistics platform. We place great value on flexibility and provide Dashers with a choice to either visit a local office for personal assistance or stay in the comfort of their own home to onboard wherever they are.
Table of Contents

•Transparency for Dashers. Through the dedicated Dasher mobile application, DoorDash strives to offer Dashers with transparency, including critical information regarding deliveries upfront such as guaranteed earnings, estimated time and distance, merchant name, and consumer drop-off information.
•Proprietary technology to optimize Dasher efficiency. We have developed proprietary technology to optimize Dasher efficiency, which keeps Dashers busy and increases their earnings potential. Based on forecasted demand, our algorithms predict the ideal number of Dashers needed in a given location at a given time. This helps balance the supply of Dashers with consumer demand and keeps Dashers busy when they are using our local logistics platform. Additionally, our algorithms contribute to a reduction in wasted time on a delivery and the improvement of Dasher efficiency in a variety of ways, including through smarter dispatching based on specific order preparation times and order batching. These technologies are vital as they improve Dasher efficiency and therefore the amount Dashers can earn and the cost-effectiveness of our local logistics platform.
SALES AND MARKETING
Marketing
The strength of our local logistics platform and the benefits that accrue to merchants, consumers, and Dashers serve as our most effective marketing tool. This has helped us generate strong organic merchant, consumer, and Dasher growth through word-of-mouth since our earliest days. We also employ paid marketing efforts to attract and retain additional merchants, consumers, and Dashers.
With merchants, we collaborate on co-marketing campaigns to promote our local logistics platform through their in-store collateral,television campaigns, and other digital marketing efforts. In addition, we will also co-create national and regional promotional campaigns with partner merchants that drive consumer demand to our Marketplace and generate significant press coverage—which in turn increases brand affinity and keeps both us and our partner merchants top of mind with consumers. 
We employ referral campaigns as well as online and offline marketing channels to attract new consumers and Dashers to our local logistics platform. Our online and offline channels include search engine marketing, display advertising, social media, streaming audio,direct mail, television, and billboards. When we acquire a new consumer or Dasher, we often provide promotions or incentives to demonstrate our value proposition to them early on in their life cycle.
Sales
We utilize both inside sales and field sales teams to grow our merchant base in the United States, Canada, and Australia. A growing portion of our merchant acquisition funnel is also self-serve. Through our self-serve channel, merchants can sign up and onboard directly via our website.
Our account management team supports our sales efforts. This team onboards merchants, drives adoption of our new offerings and services, such as DashPass, Drive, or Pickup, based on a merchant’s evolving business needs, and optimizes logistics operations. Our account management team is responsible for ensuring the continued success of merchants on our local logistics platform.
HUMAN CAPITAL AND EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2020, we had 3,886 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.
We believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values that we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.
At DoorDash we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the future—for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid innovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.

Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion
At DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the cities we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and retain the talent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we amplify the voices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has “room at the table” and the tools, resources, and opportunities to succeed.
Some of our diversity and inclusion programs at DoorDash include:
Elevate
Elevate is a program designed to increase the representation of women of color in leadership roles at our company. The year-long program starts with each member of our management team sponsoring fellows to serve on our leadership team, which exposes them to senior leadership and supports their development of business skills.
Women’s Leadership Forum
Our Women’s Leadership Forum equips mid- to senior-level technical women with skills to thrive in our workplace. This six-month program happens once a year and includes classroom-style learning, one-on-one coaching, and group roundtables. Members of our management team actively participate in the forum.
Employee Resource Groups
We support employee-led employee resource groups (ERGs), which foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. We currently have six ERGs: Hue (employees of color), Black@DoorDash, Latinx@DoorDash, Women@DoorDash, Pride@DoorDash (LGBTQIA+), and Parents@DoorDash, all of which are open to people of all backgrounds.
SMASH
We partner with the non-profit, SMASH, to host underrepresented college and college-bound students in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) during the summer. The students work closely with our engineering and product teams to develop and present solutions to various product design challenges.
COMPETITION
The markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences, fragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the following criteria:
•Merchants. We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our business enablement and demand fulfillment services. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the scale of our consumer base, the breadth of our demand fulfillment capabilities, and our broad array of services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges.
•Consumers. We compete for consumers based on a number of factors. We believe that we are positioned favorably because we provide consumers with convenient access to our unmatched combination of merchant selection, experience, and value.
•Dashers. We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors including flexibility and earnings potential. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the density of our network, the improving efficiency of our platform, and the opportunities we provide Dashers to earn.
Local food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. In the United States, we compete with other local food delivery logistics platforms including Uber Eats, Grubhub (pending acquisition by Just Eat Takeaway), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, pizza companies, such as Domino’s, online ordering systems such as Toast and ChowNow, other merchants which own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services, and companies that provide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to expand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets. In addition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to attract consumers. With Drive, and as we 
Table of Contents

continue to expand into other industry verticals beyond food, we expect to compete with large Internet companies with substantial resources, users and brand power, such as Amazon and Google.
We believe we compete favorably for merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Our innovation, brand, and focused execution have allowed us to quickly extend our network and our geographic reach and we plan to continue our efforts to expand within our existing markets and enter new markets and geographies in the future. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.”
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
We have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31, 2020, we had 25 issued U.S. patents, 41 U.S. patent applications pending, and 14 patent applications pending in a foreign jurisdiction. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2020, we held 34 registered trademarks in the United States and 48 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous pending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.doordash.com and other variations.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Intellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. These laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, commissions and fees, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, environmental protection, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks. The sale and delivery of goods through our platform is also subject to laws, regulations, and standards that govern food safety, alcohol, tobacco, cannabidiol, pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, hazardous substances, and the interstate and intrastate transport of goods. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies.
See the sections titled “Risk Factors,” including the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment—If Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment—Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise 
Table of Contents

adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations,” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties—We primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made by consumers and payments made to merchants and Dashers, and if we cannot manage our relationship with such third party and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected,” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
