 Item 1.         Business
 
Overview
 
AutoWeb, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed on May 17, 1996, and is headquartered in Tampa, Florida, with offices in Irvine California and Guatemala City, Guatemala. AutoWeb is an automotive industry marketing and used vehicle acquisition and resale company focused on being a “matchmaker” by matching consumers seeking to acquire vehicles and vehicle sellers that can best meet those consumers’ needs. We assist consumers in multiple aspects of a vehicle transaction, including providing valuable content and information to assist consumers in making informed decisions regarding their next vehicle to acquire. The Company also assists consumers who would like to sell their current vehicle through the Company’s CarZeus vehicle acquisition business, which provides an additional product line extension to the Company’s digital marketing offerings. The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “AutoWeb” and any other similar terms refer to AutoWeb, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
On July 31, 2021, the Company and Tradein Expert, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Tradein Expert”), entered into and consummated an Asset Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, Tradein Expert, Car Acquisition, LLC, a Texas limited liability company dba CarZeus (“Seller”), Carzuz.com LLC, a Texas limited liability company, McCombs Family Partners, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership and Phil Kandera, an individual, pursuant to which Tradein Expert acquired specified assets of Seller’s San Antonio, Texas-based used vehicle acquisition platform that operates under the name CarZeus (“CarZeus Purchase Transaction”). Through the Tradein Expert entity (dba CarZeus), the Company purchases used vehicles directly from consumers and resells them through wholesale channels. The operations of CarZeus are included in AutoWeb’s financial statements as of August 1, 2021.
 
The Company primarily generates revenue by assisting automotive retail dealers (“Dealers”) and automotive manufacturers (“Manufacturers” or “OEM’s”) in marketing and selling new and used vehicles to consumers through the Company’s online lead and traffic referral programs, dealer marketing products and services, and online advertising. The Company also offers automotive consumers an option to sell their used vehicle outside of a dealership location. The Company resells these vehicles indirectly to Dealers through wholesale auctions or through direct to Dealer sales.
 
Our consumer-facing automotive websites (“Company Websites”) provide consumers with information and tools to aid them with their automotive purchase decisions, the ability to sell their used vehicle without going to a Dealer, and the convenience of submitting inquiries directly to Dealers requesting that the Dealers contact the consumers regarding purchasing or leasing vehicles (“Leads”). Leads are internally-generated from our Company Websites (“Internally Generated Leads”) or acquired from third parties (“Non-Internally Generated Leads”) that generate Leads from their websites (“Non-Company Websites”). Our click traffic referral program provides consumers who are shopping for vehicles online with targeted offers based on make, model and geographic location. As these consumers conduct online research on our Company Websites or on the site of one of our network of automotive publishers, they are presented with relevant offers on a timely basis and, upon the consumer clicking on the displayed advertisement, are sent to the appropriate website location of one of our Dealer, Manufacturer, or other advertising customers.

Products and Services
 
We sell Internally Generated Leads and Non-Internally Generated Leads directly to Dealers and indirectly to Dealers through a wholesale market consisting of Manufacturers and other third parties in the automotive Lead distribution industry.  The click traffic program sends consumers to Dealer, Manufacturer, or other advertising customer websites when the consumer clicks on advertisements on Company Websites as well as on websites operated by third parties contracted with the Company as publishers under the click traffic program. We also offer Dealers and Manufacturers other products and services, including WebLeads+ and Payment Pro®, to assist in capturing online, in-market customers and in selling more vehicles by improving the conversion of Leads to sale transactions. In addition, as previously discussed, beginning August 1, 2021, we also acquire used vehicles from consumers and re-sell those vehicles to Dealers, primarily indirectly through third party wholesale auctions and through direct to Dealer sales.
Lead Programs
 
We provide Dealers and Manufacturers with opportunities to efficiently market their vehicles to potential buyers.  Dealers and Manufacturers participate in our Lead, display advertising and direct marketing programs, reaching consumers who are in the market to acquire a vehicle. For consumers, we provide, at no cost, an easy way to obtain valuable information and research material to assist them in the vehicle shopping process. Consumer Leads are acquired through our Company Websites or from third parties through their websites. For consumers using our Company Websites, we provide research information, including vehicle specifications, trade in values, safety and pricing data, photos, videos, regional rebates and incentives, and additional tools, such as comparison and configuration tools, to assist them in the buying process.  We also provide additional content on our Company Websites, including a database of articles, consumer and professional reviews, and other analyses.  
New Vehicle Leads Program. Our new vehicle Leads program allows consumers to submit requests for pricing and availability of specific new vehicle makes and models.  A Lead provides a Dealer with information regarding the make and model of vehicle the consumer is interested in purchasing as well as the consumer’s contact information.
 
Dealers participating in our new vehicle Leads program are provided with iControl ®, a proprietary technology that provides Dealers control over the volume and source of their Leads. iControl can be managed at the dealership (or by a representative of AutoWeb on behalf of the dealership) or at the Dealer group level from a web-based, easy-to-use console that makes it quick and efficient for dealerships to change their Lead acquisition strategy to adjust for inventory conditions and broader industry patterns (such as changes in gas prices or consumer demand). From the console, dealerships can easily reduce or expand territories and increase, restrict or block specific models and Lead web sources, making it much easier to manage inventory challenges and focus marketing resources more efficiently.
 
Our Leads are subject to a quality verification system designed to maintain high-quality Leads and increase Lead buy rates for our Lead customers. Quality verification includes validation of consumer contact information. Our proprietary quality verification process also involves arrangements with third-party vendors specializing in customer validation. After a Lead has been verified, and if we have placement coverage for the Lead within our network of Dealer customers, we send the Lead to selected Dealers in the consumer’s geographic area that sell the type of vehicle requested by the consumer. Additionally, we send an email to the consumer with the Dealer’s name and phone number, and, if applicable, the name of the dealership’s internet manager. Dealers contact the consumer with a price quote and availability information for the requested vehicle. We also sell Leads wholesale to Manufacturers for delivery to their Dealers and also to third parties that have placement coverage for the Lead outside of our Dealer network.
 
Dealers participate in our retail new vehicle Leads program by entering into contracts directly with us or through major Dealer groups. Generally, Dealer contracts are non-exclusive and may be terminated for convenience by either party with 30 days’ notice. The majority of our retail new vehicle Lead revenues consists of either a monthly subscription fee or a per-Lead fee paid by our network of Dealers. We generally reserve the right to adjust our fees at any time during the term of the contract with at least 30 days’ notice. Manufacturers (directly or through their marketing agencies) and other third parties participate in our wholesale new vehicle Leads programs generally by entering into agreements where either party has the right to terminate for convenience upon prior notice, with the length of time for the notice varying by contract. Revenues from retail new vehicle Leads accounted for approximately 16% and 17% of total revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenues from wholesale Leads accounted for approximately 53% and 58% of total revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Used Vehicle Leads Program. Our used vehicle Leads program allows consumers to search for used vehicles according to specific search parameters including price, make, model, mileage, year and location of the vehicle. The consumer is able to locate and display the description, price and, if available, digital images of vehicles that satisfy the consumer’s search parameters.  The consumer can then submit a Lead for additional information regarding a specific vehicle of interest that the Company delivers to the Dealer offering the vehicle. In addition to sending Leads directly to Dealers through our Lead delivery system, consumers may choose to contact the Dealer using a toll-free number posted next to each vehicle in the consumer’s search results. We charge each Dealer that participates in the used vehicle Leads program either a monthly subscription fee or a per Lead fee.  Revenues from used vehicle Leads accounted for 3% and 4% of total revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Advertising Programs
 
Our Company Websites attract an audience of prospective automotive buyers that advertisers can target through display advertising. A primary way advertisers use our Company Websites to reach consumers is through vehicle content targeting. This allows automotive marketers to reach consumers while they are researching one of our automotive segments, such as mini-vans or SUVs, and offers Manufacturers sponsorship opportunities to assist in their customer retention and new consumer acquisition strategies. Our Company Websites also offer Manufacturers the opportunity to feature their makes and models within highly contextual content. Through advertising placements, Manufacturers can direct consumers to their respective websites for further information. We believe this transfer of focused, interested consumers to Manufacturer sites is the most significant action measured by Manufacturers in evaluating our performance and value for the Manufacturers’ marketing programs. Through our agreement with a third party, the third party sells our fixed placement advertising across our Company Websites to automotive advertisers. We also offer a direct marketing platform that enables Manufacturers to target in-market consumers selectively during the often-extended vehicle shopping process. Designed to keep a specific automotive brand in consideration, our direct marketing programs allow automotive marketers to deliver specific communication through either email or direct mail formats to in-market consumers during the shopping process.
 
Our click traffic program is a pay-per-click advertising program. The click traffic program utilizes proprietary technology to provide consumers targeted offers based on make, model and geographic location. As consumers are conducting research on one of our consumer facing websites or on the site of one of our network of automotive publishers, they are presented with timely, relevant offers and, upon the consumer clicking the displayed advertisement, are sent to the website of one of our Dealer, Manufacturer or other advertising customers. The AutoWeb network of publisher websites reaches and engages with millions of potential car buyers each month, and we believe our network of publisher websites provides high-intent, high-quality traffic that Dealers and other customers cannot typically reach through their own marketing efforts. The click traffic program is flexible and in addition to driving traffic to a vehicle detail page, it sends website traffic to new vehicle sales, service, used vehicles or any other department where our customers want to engage with in-market consumers. In addition, we believe that our click traffic program can be used to more effectively reach competitive shoppers who are researching competitor brands than typical search engines. Advertisers only pay for the clicks they receive and are able to structure campaigns with flexible budgets and no long-term commitments in order to effectively manage spend against their key performance indicators. We receive ongoing feedback from our customers that indicates this traffic provides highly targeted marketing opportunities and is a valuable tool to assist Dealers in selling more vehicles.
 
Advertising revenues, including direct marketing, accounted for 20% of total revenues in 2021 and 2020.
 
Used Vehicle Acquisition
 
As a result of the CarZeus Purchase Transaction, beginning August 1, 2021, we now acquire used vehicles from consumers and resell these vehicles wholesale to Dealers, either indirectly through third party auctions or through direct to dealer sales. Our used vehicle acquisition and resale operations are located in Texas with operations in San Antonio, Austin and Houston. Our used vehicle acquisition and resale operations accounted for 7% of total revenues in 2021.
Other Dealer Products and Services
 
The Company also offers products and services that assist Dealers in connecting with in-market consumers and in closing vehicle sales.

WebLeads+. Designed to work in connection with a Dealer’s participation in our Leads programs, WebLeads+ is a third-party product that offers a Dealer multiple coupon options that display relevant marketing messages to consumers visiting the Dealer’s website.  With WebLeads+, consumers who visit the Dealer’s website are encouraged to take action in two ways.  First, on the Dealer website, a consumer is presented with a customized special offer formatted for easy Lead submission. If a vehicle quote is requested, the Lead goes directly to the dealership management tool so the dealership sales team can promptly address the customer’s request.  Second, if the consumer leaves the Dealer’s website but remains online, the WebLeads+ product keeps the coupon active in a new browser, which provides the Dealer a repeat branding opportunity and the consumer an easy way to re-engage with the Dealer’s website through submission of a Lead.  The additional Leads generated by the coupons are seamlessly integrated into our Extranet tool.
Payment Pro®.  Payment Pro® is a Dealer website conversion tool based on a third-party product that offers consumers real-time online monthly payment information based on an instant evaluation process.  Payments are based on a third-party review of the consumer’s credit, the actual vehicle being researched, and Dealer finance rates and without requiring a credit check. The Lead goes directly into the Dealer’s management tool so that the dealership sales team can promptly address the consumer’s inquiry.
Strategy
 
Our goal is to transition from primarily an automotive digital media provider to a transactionally focused matchmaker that participates in the vehicle transaction process in multiple ways. We plan to achieve this objective through the following principal strategies:
 
Increase the Supply of High-Quality Leads. High-quality Leads are those Leads that result in high transaction (i.e., vehicle acquisition) closing rates for our Dealer and Manufacturer customers.  Internally Generated Leads are generally higher quality than Non-Internally Generated Leads and increase the overall quality of our Lead portfolio. Non-Internally Generated Leads are of varying quality depending on the source of these Leads. We plan to increase the supply of high-quality Leads generated to sell to our customers primarily by:
 

● | Increasing traffic acquisition activities on Company Websites. Traffic to our Company Websites is monetized primarily though the creation of Leads that are delivered to our Dealer or Manufacturer customers to help them market and sell new and used vehicles and through the sale of advertising space on our Company Websites. We plan to increase the traffic to our Company Websites through effective search engine optimization (“SEO”) and search engine marketing (“SEM”) traffic acquisition activities and enhancements to our Company Websites. SEO is the practice of optimizing keywords in website content to drive traffic to a website through natural search. SEM is the practice of bidding on keywords on search engines to drive traffic to a website.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SEO and SEM traffic acquisition activities. Traffic to our Company Websites is obtained through a variety of sources and methods, including direct navigation, SEO, SEM, direct marketing and partnering with other website publishers that provide links to our websites. Our goal is that over time, paid traffic such as SEM will be balanced by greater visitation from direct navigation and SEO, which we expect to result in increased Lead volume and Lead gross profit margins.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continuing to enhance the quality and user experience of our Company Websites. We continuously make enhancements to our Company Websites, including in the design and functionality and by adding new and compelling features for consumers to engage with. These enhancements are intended to position our Company Websites as best-in-class destinations for automotive purchase research by consumers. By doing so, we believe we will increase the volume of our Internally Generated Leads.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing the conversion rate of visitors to Leads on our Company Websites. Through increased and optimized SEO and SEM activities and significant content, tools and user interface enhancements to our websites, we believe we will be able to increase the number of website visits and improve website “engagement” by consumers, thereby increasing the conversion of page views into Leads. We believe that an increased conversion rate of page views into Leads could result in higher revenue per visitor.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Relationships with Suppliers of High-Quality, Non-Internally Generated Leads. We plan to continue to develop and maintain strong relationships with suppliers that consistently provide high-quality Non-Internally Generated Leads.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increasing Leads Sales to our Customers. Our principal source of revenue comes from the sale of Leads to our retail and wholesale Lead customers. Our goal is to increase sales of Leads to our customers primarily by:

● | Increasing Lead Sales to Dealers. The sale of Leads to our Dealer network constitute a significant source of revenues. During 2021, we continued to focus our Dealer acquisition and retention strategies on dealerships to which we could deliver a higher percentage of Internally Generated Leads. We believe this will result in increased vehicle sales for our Dealers and ultimately stronger relationships with our Dealers due to the higher quality of Internally Generated Leads as previously discussed. Our goal is to increase the number of Leads sold to our retail Dealer customers by:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | increasing the quality of Leads sold to Dealers,
--+-------------------------------------------------


o | increasing the number of Dealers in our Dealer network,
--+--------------------------------------------------------


o | reducing Dealer network churn,
--+-------------------------------


o | providing customizable Lead programs to meet our Dealers’ unique marketing requirements,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | providing additional value-added marketing services that assist Dealers in more effectively utilizing the internet to market and sell new and used vehicles,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | increasing overall Dealer satisfaction by improving all aspects of our services,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | focusing on higher revenue Dealers that are more cost-effective to support, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | enhancing our internal Lead generation activities by leveraging our expanded retail lead coverage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing Lead Sales to Wholesale Customers. We currently have agreements to sell Leads to Manufacturer Lead programs. We intend to continue to demonstrate the value of third-party leads to Manufacturers by providing close rate and cross sell data to our wholesale customers that demonstrates that third-party leads result in incremental sales for Manufacturers. Our intention is to increase revenue by providing a compelling use case that causes Manufacturers to enhance their business rules, program capacity, pricing and coverage so each Manufacturer can purchase an optimal mix of Leads.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focus on Internal Traffic Acquisition Processes. We are continuing to focus on prioritizing our internal traffic acquisition processes by obtaining higher quality impressions for both Dealers and wholesale customers, which we believe should yield increased gross profit margins.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Continuing to develop the click traffic program for online automotive advertisers and publishers.  Our click traffic program uses proprietary technology and a pay-per-click business model to analyze web traffic and adjust advertiser costs accordingly based on traffic quality.  This traffic network is targeted to attract high-intent, high-volume publishers and is intended to allow them to monetize traffic that has previously been under-monetized.  In-market car shoppers are presented with highly relevant display advertisements and benefit from an online experience that delivers information that consumers use in making their car buying decisions.  Manufacturers benefit from this high-quality traffic from serious in-market car buyers.  Our click traffic program enables Manufacturers and Dealers to optimize their advertising by driving traffic to appropriate areas of their Tier 1 (Manufacturer national advertising), Tier 2 (Manufacturer and advertising associations regional advertising) and Tier 3 (Dealer) websites.  
 We believe Manufacturers and Dealers will see the measurable attribution from this click traffic and will reallocate marketing spend from traditional channels into this medium. We also plan to grow the size of this addressable marketplace by adding high-quality and high-volume automotive publishers to our network, targeting in-market consumers on a variety of social media platforms and by continuing to optimize this advertising platform on our consumer-facing websites. In addition, we believe that the flexibility of our solution combined with high-quality traffic with automotive purchase intent may allow us to grow our click advertiser base as the level of attribution from this product is understood by advertising partners.
 
Display Advertising Revenues.  As traffic to, and time spent on, our Company Websites by consumers increases, we will seek to increase our advertising revenues.  Through our agreement with a third party, we benefit from the third party’s relationships with major automotive Manufacturers and/or the third party’s advertising agencies by increasing revenues for our traditional display advertising.
 
Continuing to Expand our Products and Services. We gather significant amounts of data on consumer vehicle purchase intent.  We intend to use these data to create products and services, including direct business database offerings, that we believe will ultimately assist Manufacturers and Dealers in marketing and selling more vehicles.  Our objective is to generate revenues from this asset in the most effective and efficient ways possible.

Used Vehicle Acquisition. In connection with the CarZeus Purchase Transaction, beginning August 1, 2021, we also sell used vehicles which are acquired from consumers and sold to Dealers indirectly through third party wholesale auctions and through direct to Dealer sales. The CarZeus Purchase Transaction provided the Company with an additional monetization opportunity by leveraging our existing expertise in identifying high quality in-market buyers in order to participate more meaningfully in the used vehicle acquisition and sales process through the acquisition of used vehicles from consumers and resale of these vehicles into the wholesale sales channel. We believe this acquisition allows us to increase our total addressable market by expanding our presence in the used vehicle space, while giving us the opportunity to enhance the offerings and usefulness of our underutilized Company Websites and monetize our traffic more effectively. We plan to use our traffic acquisition capabilities and operational efficiency to drive growth, improve financial performance and build scalable operating processes to enhance performance within the San Antonio, Austin and Houston, Texas markets. With this foundation in place, we plan to prepare the business for broader geographic expansion over time.
Strategic Acquisitions, Investments and Alliances. Our goal is to grow and enhance our business. We may do so, in part, through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. We continue to review strategic opportunities that may provide opportunities for growth. We believe strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances may allow us to increase market share, benefit from advancements in technology and strengthen our business operations by enhancing our product and service offerings.
 
Our ability to implement the foregoing strategies and plans and to achieve our goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will successfully implement our strategies and plans or achieve our goals.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the discussion of “Forward-Looking Statements” immediately preceding Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Seasonality
 
Our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to various factors, including consumer buying trends, changing economic conditions, Manufacturer new vehicle production levels, Manufacturer incentive programs and actual or threatened severe weather events.  Lead volume is typically highest in the summer (third quarter) and winter (first quarter) months, followed by spring (second quarter) and fall (fourth quarter). Historical seasonality trends have been and may continue to be impacted by externalities such as pandemics, supply chain disruptions and new vehicle inventory shortages.
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property includes patents related to our innovations, products and services; trademarks related to our brands, products and services; copyrights in software and creative content; trade secrets; and other intellectual property rights and licenses of various kinds. We seek to protect our intellectual property assets through patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other laws and through contractual provisions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and non-disclosure agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business in order to secure our proprietary rights and additionally limit access to, and disclosure of, our proprietary information.  We have registered trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including AutoWeb®, AutoWeb.com®, the global highway logo, Autobytel, Autobytel.com, MyGarage, iControl®, TextShield®, and Payment Pro® and have a pending application for the registration of the CarZeus trademark. We cannot provide any assurances that any of our intellectual property rights will be enforceable by us in litigation or will not be successfully challenged. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
 
In the automotive-related digital marketing services marketplace we compete for Dealer and Manufacturer customers.  Competition with respect to our core Lead referral programs continued to be impacted by changing industry conditions in 2021. We continue to compete with several companies that maintain business models similar to ours, some with greater resources. In addition, competition has increased from larger competitors that traditionally have competed only in the used vehicle market.  Dealers continue to invest in their proprietary websites and traffic acquisition activities, and we expect this trend to continue as Dealers strive to own and control more Lead generating assets under their captive brands. Additionally, all major Manufacturers that market their vehicles in the U.S. have their own websites that market their vehicles direct to consumers and generate Leads for delivery direct to Manufacturer Dealers. We compete primarily based on Lead quality and pricing.
 
  -6- 

  

We believe third-party Leads have been the standard in our industry for many years.  However, we continue to observe new and emerging business models, including pay-per-sale and consumer pay models, relating to the generation and delivery of Leads.  From time to time, new products and services are introduced that take the focus away from third-party Lead generation, which we believe is a profitable way to sell vehicles to in-market buyers. Dealers and Manufacturers may decide to pull back on their third-party Lead programs to test these new approaches.
 
In the display advertising marketplace, we compete with major internet portals, transaction-based websites, automotive related companies, numerous lifestyle websites and emerging entrants in the automotive click revenue medium. According to industry forecasts, the top two digital advertising platforms in the U.S. are Google and Facebook, which are expected to maintain their dominant hold on digital advertising dollars. We also compete with traditional marketing channels such as print, radio, and television.
 
In pay-per-click advertising, we compete with established search engine providers as well as a growing number of digital marketing platforms focused on generating dealership website traffic from inventory listings and social media campaigns. In addition, some industry providers who have historically specialized in inventory aggregation or in providing SEM agency services to Dealers are now expanding into the area of website traffic generation. Further, many dealership website providers are now offering traffic solutions as part of their bundle of services.
 
Some traditional data providers are also moving to deliver personalized digital marketing services at scale. These digital marketing hubs and data management platforms provide marketers with standardized access to audience data, content, workflow triggers and operational analytics to automate execution and optimization of multichannel campaigns. These services could be used as a source of lead generation and website traffic by Dealers and Manufacturers and could replace our existing product offerings.
 
The U.S. used car acquisition marketplace is highly fragmented, and we face competition from franchised dealers, who sell both new and used vehicles, online buyers, independent used car dealers and private parties. Competition in our industry has evolved with the adoption of online platforms and marketing tools, all of which facilitate increased competition. A number of our competitors maintain business models similar to ours, many of which have much greater resources. We believe that our principal competitive advantage in used vehicle acquisition is our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the car selling experience through competitive price offers and our customer-friendly sales process.
 
Customers
 
We have a concentration of credit risk with our automotive industry related accounts receivable balances, particularly with Carat Detroit (General Motors), Urban Science Applications (which represents several Manufacturer programs) and Autodata Solutions and Shift Digital. Approximately 43% or $30.9 million of total revenues and approximately 64% or $7.3 million of gross accounts receivable were related to these four customers at December 31, 2021 as follows:  

Customers | % of Revenue | | | % of Account Receivable 
---------------------------+---------------+----+---+-------------------------
Carat Detroit | | 12 | % | | 20 | %
Urban Science Applications | | 12 | % | | 18 | %
Autodata Solutions | | 13 | % | | 16 | %
Shift Digital | | 6 | % | | 10 | %
Total | | 43 | % | | 64 | %

Operations and Technology
 
We believe our future success is significantly dependent upon our ability to provide high-performing, reliable, and comprehensive websites and advertising systems; enhance consumer and Dealer product and service offerings; maintain the highest levels of information privacy; and ensure transactional security. Our Company Websites and advertising systems are hosted at a secure third-party data center facility and with public cloud providers. The data center and public cloud systems utilize redundant power infrastructure and network connectivity, distributed services, fire detection and suppression systems and physical security protocols to prevent unauthorized access and to provide high service availability, upon which our technology is built, deployed and operated. While our network and computer systems are built on industry standard technology, our Websites and information technology systems are susceptible to, and have been impacted by, outages and interruptions, including the malware attack we experienced in January 2020. For additional information regarding risks related to our information technology, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
  -7- 

  

System enhancements are primarily intended to accommodate increased traffic across our Company Websites, improve the speed in which Leads and advertisements are processed, introduce new and enhanced products and services, and provide cybersecurity protections against evolving technology threats. System enhancements entail the implementation of sophisticated new technology and system processes. We implement industry standard automation and delivery processes and employ centralized quality assurance to improve the quality, scalability, security, compliance, and availability of our products. We plan to continue to make investments in technology as necessary to improve our service offerings.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to laws and regulations generally applicable to providers of digital marketing services and companies engaged in used vehicle acquisition and resale, including federal and state laws and regulations governing data security and privacy; voice, email and text messaging communications with consumers; unfair and deceptive acts and practices; advertising; contests, sweepstakes and promotions; content regulation and motor vehicle dealer licensing. For additional important information related to government regulation of our business, including governmental regulations relating to the marketing and sale of automobiles, see the information set forth in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Employees
 
As of March 22, 2022, we had 162 full-time employees.
