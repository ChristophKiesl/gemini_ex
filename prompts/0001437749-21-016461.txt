Business Strategy
 
Drug Discovery and Development of Novel Cannabis-Based Therapies
 
Through its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. ("GBSGB"), the Company has conducted ground-breaking research embracing the rational design of plant-based medicines led by Dr. Andrea Small-Howard, the Company’s Chief Science Officer and Director, and Dr. Helen Turner, Vice President of Innovation and Dean of the Natural Sciences and Mathematics Department at Chaminade University.  Small-Howard and Turner posited that complex mixtures of plant-based ingredients would provide more targeted and effective treatments for specific disease conditions than either single ingredient or whole plant formulations.  They developed a rapid screening and assaying system which tested thousands of combinations of cannabinoids and terpenes in vitro against cell-based models of disease.  This process identified precise mixtures of cannabinoids and terpenes, many of which contained no THC, to treat categories of disease conditions, including neurological disorders, inflammation, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, chronic and neuropathic pain. 
 
GBSGB’s drug discovery engine involves both high throughput screening of cell models of disease and a data analytics/machine learning tool to expedite drug discovery. Initially, GBSGB explored the potential medical uses of specific mixtures derived from cannabis-based raw materials, but these tools are also effective for investigating the medical applications of complex therapeutic mixtures from any plant-derived starting material. In 2014, GBSGB developed its first rapid screening and assaying system which tested thousands of combinations of cannabinoids and terpenes against cell-based models of diseases. This process has been refined over the years and now has identified precise mixtures of cannabinoids and terpenes, many of which contained no THC, to treat categories of disease conditions, including neurological disorders, inflammation, heart disease, metabolic syndrome, chronic and neuropathic pain. GBSGB has filed for patent protection on these plant-inspired, complex therapeutic mixtures, and they are testing them in disease-specific animal models in preparation for human trials.
 
GBSGB’s drug discovery process combines: 1) HTS: high throughput screening of tens of thousands of combinations of compounds derived from plants in well-established cellular models of diseases, and 2) PhAROS™: Phytomedical Analytics for Research Optimization at Scale for the prediction of complex therapeutic mixtures from plant-based materials. This combined approach to drug discovery increases research efficiency and accuracy reducing the time from ideation to patenting from 7 years to 1.5 years. Screening of plant-based mixtures for drug discovery involves the testing of specific combinations of plant chemicals from many naturally occurring plants and the use of live models for these diseases that have been well established by other researchers. First, the Company finds plant materials that show some therapeutic activity, and then refines these natural mixtures to optimize their effectiveness in cellular assays by removing compounds that do not act synergistically with the others in the mixtures. The Company also use its PhAROS™ Platform to prioritize and eliminate some potential combinations, which reduces the time in the discovery period. PhAROS™ can also be used to identify and predict the efficacy of plant-derived, complex therapeutic mixtures for specific diseases in silico, which are then tested in the cell models.
 
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office allows complex mixtures to be claimed as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("APIs"). GBSGB has three issued patents and a series of pending patents containing cannabis-derived complex mixtures that act as therapeutic agents for specific disease categories, as described below. GBSGB’s pending patents are protected whether the individual compounds are derived from the cannabis plant, another plant, synthetically produced, or derived from a combination of sources for the individual chemical compounds in these mixtures.

Drug Development Progress
 
GBS Global Biopharma, Inc. has made significant strides in the past year with respect to both its drug discovery research and product development programs. Our lead pharmaceutical programs in both Parkinson’s disease and chronic neuropathic pain are now in preclinical animal studies with Dr. Lee Ellis of the National Research Council ("NRC") Canada in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Our complex therapeutic mixtures for the treatment of Cytokine Release Syndrome in COVID-19 and other severe hyperinflammatory conditions are now being tested in preclinical studies with Dr. Norbert Kaminski at Michigan State University. In addition, the two patents which protect GBSGB’s formulations in our lead development programs have been issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). On December 8, 2020, our third US patent was issued on complex therapeutic mixtures for the treatment of the hyper inflammatory condition, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome ("MCAS"). Achieving these significant milestones is driving interest in these novel therapeutic programs.
 
For its lead program in PD therapeutics, GBSGB announced that it has obtained the statistically significant reduction of Parkinson’s-disease like symptoms using its proprietary complex mixtures in an animal model of Parkinson’s disease ("PD"). Several of GBSGB’s PD formulations significantly reduced the symptoms, while the most effective formula reduced the symptoms back to the baseline activity of normal animals. In addition, the toxicity studies for these PD formulas came back without any significant negative findings. These important preclinical results will be included in GBS’ Investigational New Drug ("IND") application with the US FDA to enter human clinical trials as soon as possible. New therapies to address Parkinson’s disease symptoms are needed to help those afflicted with this debilitating disease. The combined direct and indirect costs associated with Parkinson’s disease are estimated at $52 billion in the U.S. alone.
 
For Parkinson’s disease, the initial clinical prototypes of GBSGB’s Cannabinoid-Containing Complex Mixtures ("CCCM™") are being formulated by Catalent Pharma using Catalent’s Zydis® Orally Disintegrating Tablet ("ODT") technology. This ODT format was selected for the PD formulas because it dissolves on the tongues of patients without the need to swallow for ease of use in patients with PD, who often have difficulties with swallowing. GBSGB selected Catalent as its development partner for the PD therapies due to Catalent’s prior experience in working on US FDA-approved, cannabinoid-containing drugs, their Schedule I drug manufacturing facilities, their familiarity with US FDA and international regulatory and manufacturing requirements, their expertise in tackling formulation challenges, and their ability to achieve the stability and dosing necessary for these novel complex mixtures. In addition to its Zydis® technology, Catalent has early drug development services and additional oral drug delivery solutions available for the efficient delivery of GBSGB's proprietary APIs.
 
For its lead chronic neuropathic pain program, GBSGB is testing its Cannabinoid-Containing Complex Mixtures and Myrcene-Containing Complex Mixtures ("MCCM") both as encapsulated, time-released nanoparticles, as well as in non-encapsulated forms of these therapeutic mixtures in an animal model at the NRC in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In preparation for human clinical trials, our standard MCCM and the time-released MCCM are currently being compared in an animal model that demonstrates their potential effectiveness at treating chronic pain. The early results from this preclinical research project look very promising.
 
The three patents which protect formulations in the Company’s lead therapeutic programs have been issued by the USPTO. The issuance of U.S. Patent No. 10,653,640 entitled "Cannabinoid-Containing Complex Mixtures for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases" on May 19, 2020 protects methods of using GBSGB’s proprietary cannabinoid-containing complex mixtures (CCCM™) for treating Parkinson’s Disease. This was an important milestone in the development of these vitally-important therapies and validates GBSGB’s drug discovery platform. In the US alone, the combined direct and indirect costs associated with Parkinson’s disease are estimated at $52 billion, and new therapies to address Parkinson’s disease symptoms are greatly needed. This was also the first time that a US patent has been awarded for a cannabis-based complex mixture defined using this type of drug discovery method. The first US patent for PD therapies validated our drug discovery platform and strengthened our intellectual property portfolio of unique CCCM’s™, each targeting one of up to 60 specific clinical applications.
 
The issuance of GBSGB’s second US patent for active pharmaceutical ingredients that are complex mixtures identified by our biotech platform further confirms that GBSGB’s pharmaceutical compositions can be patent-protected for use as biopharmaceutical and nutraceutical products. The US Patent entitled “Myrcene-Containing Complex Mixtures Targeting TRPV1” protects methods of using GBSGB’s proprietary Myrcene-Containing Complex Mixtures for the treatment of pain disorders related to arthritis, shingles, irritable bowel syndrome, sickle cell disease, and endometriosis. In the US alone, chronic pain represents an estimated health burden of between $560 and $650 billion dollars, and an estimated 20.4% of U.S. adults suffer from chronic pain that significantly decreases their quality of life. Despite the widespread rates of addiction and death, opioids remain the standard of care treatment for most people with chronic pain. The Company believes that it is important to create safer, less addictive alternatives to opioids for the treatment of chronic pain disorders, like GBSGB’s myrcene-containing complex mixtures.
 
Favorable Research Updates from our university collaborators reveal the promise in our discovery programs with Michigan State University (HIV-Associated Neurodegenerative Disorder and COVID-19 therapies), Chaminade University (Chronic Neuropathic Pain, Metabolic Syndrome, Cannabis Metabolomics with the University of Athens), the University of Athens, Greece (Cannabis Metabolomics), the University of Seville, Spain (Time-Released Nanoparticles), and the National Research Council of Canada (Parkinson’s Disease, Chronic Neuropathic Pain).

Partnering Strategy 
 
GBSGB runs a lean drug development program and minimizes expenses, including personnel, overhead, and fixed capital expenses (such as lab and diagnostic equipment), through strategic partnerships with Universities and Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”). Through these research and development agreements, GBSGB has created a virtual pipeline for the further development of novel medicines extracted from the cannabis plant. The partners bring both expertise and infrastructure at a reasonable cost to the life sciences program. In most instances, GBSGB has also negotiated with these partners to keep 100% of the ownership of the IP within GBSGB for original patent filings.
 
GBSGB currently has on-going research agreements with the following institutions covering the indicated areas of research:
 
Chaminade University: Broad-based research program to support the drug discovery platform that has yielded many of GBSGB’s original patents to date in the areas of neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease, inflammatory diseases, neuropathic and chronic pain. They have also performed the bioassay portion of the Cannabis Metabolomics study performed with the University of Athens, Greece and GBSGB.
 
University of Athens: Broad-based metabolomics analysis of over 100 cannabis genotypes including both hemp and THC-producing cannabis varieties, in combination with GBSGB’s bioassay data linking genotypes and potential disease-remediations. This project has the potential to define active ingredients from plant-derived mixtures beyond the standard cannabinoids and terpenoids. The discovery potential is huge, and novel agents have recently been discovered.
 
Michigan State University: Discovery work using a cutting-edge, multi-cellular model of the human immune system and a multi-cell model of the brain to explore CCCM™s for use in the prevention of HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND). Although combination antiretroviral therapy keeps symptoms for most HIV-patients well controlled, between 40% and 70% of these well-controlled HIV patients end up with HAND symptoms that range from movement disorders to dementia-like symptoms. The results from this work were included in a new patent application that will be filed in Q3 of 2020. In addition, MSU has performed experiments using their novel model of the human-immune system that have allowed GBSGB to prepare cannabis-based formulas for the potential treatment of virally-induced hyperinflammation/cytokine storm syndrome that has led to the majority of COVID-19 deaths. The new patent application for our novel, cannabinoid-containing complex mixtures (CCCM™) for the treatment of hyperinflammation and cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 patients was filed August 18, 2020.
 
The University of Seville: Bringing their novel expertise to the development and functional testing of time-released and disease-targeted nanoparticles of cannabis-based complex mixtures for oral administration. These specialized nanoparticles are being used for the precise and time-released delivery of several of our therapies, including GBSGB’s MCCM™ and CCCM™’s used in the preclinical animal testing performed at the NRC Canada. The University of Seville has completed functional testing on nanoparticles containing myrcene, nerolidol, and beta-caryophyllene for our Myrcene-Containing Complex Mixtures. In these cell-based assays, the effectiveness and kinetics of the nanoparticle-forms of these terpenes were compared with the “naked” terpenes both individually and in mixtures. In all cases, the effectiveness of the nanoparticles were superior to the naked terpenes, however, the mixtures were dramatically more effective than the individuals. These results from Seville are very promising as these nanoparticles have entered the animal testing phase at the NRC in Halifax.
 
The National Research Center (NRC) of Canada, Halifax, Nova Scotia: Two animal-phase studies are being performed by Dr. Lee Ellis’ group at the NRC. An animal safety and efficacy study was initiated in Q4 of 2018 for GBSGB’s Parkinson’s disease therapies, and the NRC has demonstrated that the company’s PD formulations were able to reduce behavioral changes associated with the loss of dopamine-producing neurons, which underlies the pathology of Parkinson’s disease in the animal model. Based on achieving the statistically significant reduction in Parkinson’s disease symptomology, GBSGB has signed an amendment to include a final phase of testing, which will study the mechanism of action for these promising formulations. In Q1 of 2019, GBSGB started a safety and efficacy study in animals for GBSGB’s Chronic Neuropathic Pain (CNP) formulas. The midterm results for these preclinical pain studies are promising.
 
The University of Cadiz: Testing the safety and efficacy of the above-mentioned time-released nanoparticles in rodent models of chronic pain. Proof of concept complete for one formulation.
 
University of Hawaii: Validating the efficacy of a complex cannabis-based mixture for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac disease in a rodent model. Proof of concept work is complete.

Path to Market: Drug Development Stages and Proposed Clinical Trials
 
GBSGB has plant-based therapeutic products in the following stages of drug development: Discovery, Pre-Clinical, and entering the Clinical Phase. It has also licensed therapeutic products that the Company intends to develop through partners, labeled Partner Programs.
 
The completion of pre-clinical studies, clinical trials, and obtaining FDA-approvals for pharmaceutical products is traditionally a long and expensive process. However, GBSGB asserts that its plant-based drug discovery engine, lean development program, novel regulatory strategy, experienced development partners, and aggressive licensing of these products at early clinical stages can mitigate some of the risks. The Company uses a combination of in silico discovery methods and automated screening of cellular models of disease to decrease the time in Discovery prior to filing novel patent applications for disease-specific therapeutics. GBSGB’s original patent applications cover new chemical entities (“NCE”) based on complex combinations of plant-derived compounds. Its Exploratory IND/Phase 0 Program gets the Company to First-in-Man sooner than traditional programs, which reduces translational risks, and includes preliminary efficacy measures for responsible development decisions. In contrast, a traditional phased-development path would not provide any efficacy measures until Phase II. After the completion of our Phase 0 study, which compares the efficacies of multiple related cannabis-based formulations, the Company plans to advance the lead drug candidate using an adaptive trial design that is more efficient than the traditional phased-development pathway. GBSGB has entered into research contracts, partnerships, and/or joint ventures with several respected, independent contract research organizations, medical schools, universities, and other scientific researchers to increase developmental efficiencies. If and when one or more of GBSGB’s drugs, therapies or treatments are approved by the FDA, GBSGB will seek to market them under licensing arrangements with major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies.
 
There can be no assurance that we will ever be able to enter into any joint ventures or other arrangements with third parties to finance our drug development program or that if we are able to do so, that any of our projected therapies will ever be approved by the FDA. It also may be anticipated that even if we enter into a joint venture development with a financially stable pharmaceutical or institutional partner, we will still be required to raise significant additional capital in the future to achieve the strategic goals of GBSGB. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional capital on reasonable terms, if at all. If GBSGB fails to achieve its goal of producing one or more plant-based pharmaceuticals or therapies, it would have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and business prospects.

Other Operations
 
In addition to our biopharmaceutical research and development activities described in detail above, the Company has operated in the medical and adult-use cannabis markets under State-issued cultivation and production licenses.  Our wholly owned subsidiary GB Sciences Nevada, LLC (“GBSN”) leases a warehouse facility at 3550 W. Teco Avenue, Las Vegas Nevada (the "Teco Facility") and operates a cannabis cultivation facility under Nevada licenses for the medical and adult-use markets. Our wholly owned subsidiary GB Sciences Las Vegas, LLC ("GBLV") holds Nevada certificates for medical and adult-use cannabis production and produces extracts and concentrates for the wholesale market.
 
On November 15, 2019, we entered into a Binding Letter of Intent (the "LOI") to sell the Company's membership interest interests in GBSN and GBLV (together, the "Teco Subsidiaries"). In connection with the LOI, we entered into a Management Agreement with the purchaser whereby the facilities will be managed by an affiliate of the purchaser until the close of the sale. On March 24, 2020, we entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Teco MIPA") which formalized the sale of the Teco Subsidiaries and modified the terms of the sale. Pursuant to the Teco MIPA, the Company will sell 100% of its membership interests in GBSN and GBLV for $4,000,000 cash upon close and $4,000,000 in the form of an 8% promissory note.
 
On November 27, 2019, we entered into a Binding Letter of Intent to sell the Company's 100% interest in GB Sciences Nopah, LLC. On August 10, 2020, the Company entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement ("Nopah MIPA") and Promissory Note Modification Agreement with the purchaser of GB Sciences Nopah, LLC. The Company will receive $300,000 upon closing, and the purchaser will pay all expenses related to the upkeep and maintenance of the Nopah License from the date of the agreement. The $300,000 purchase price will be paid as a reduction to the balance of the 0% Note payable dated October 23, 2017, which is held by an affiliate of the purchaser of the Nopah license.
 
The sales of the Teco and Nopah Subsidiaries are expected to close upon the successful transfer of the Nevada cannabis cultivation and production licenses held by those subsidiaries. The transfer of cannabis licenses in the State of Nevada has been subject to an indefinite moratorium since October 2019. In a meeting held on July 21, 2020, the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board lifted the moratorium, however, the board has indicated that there were initially 90 requests pending, and it will take up to several months to process the entire backlog of pending license transfers. Based on this information, we cannot provide any assurances as to the timing of the close of the sale. In addition, the lifting of the moratorium and processing of cannabis license transfers have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and could be further delayed if the pandemic continues.
 
Sale of Membership Interest in GB Sciences Louisiana, LLC
 
On November 15, 2019, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Wellcana Plus, LLC, a Louisiana limited liability company ("Wellcana"), whereby Wellcana would acquire the Company’s 50.01% membership interest (the “Membership Interest”) in GB Sciences Louisiana LLC, a Louisiana limited liability company. Since entering into the agreement, certain modifications of the Agreement were made. It was ultimately agreed that Wellcana would pay the Company $4,900,000 in cash for the Membership Interest. On December 16, 2020, Wellcana made the final payment totaling $4,900,000 which completed the disposition of the Membership Interest.

Competition
 
The biotech industry is subject to intense and increasing competition. We face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical technology companies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater capital resources, facilities and infrastructure then we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market. These competitors include Cara Therapeutics Inc., Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc., Tetra Bio-Pharma, Inc., Revive Therapeutics, Inc., Axim Biotechnologies, Inc., and Emerald BioScience,  Inc., among others.
 
There are several organizations that may be developing or marketing therapies for the indications that we are pursuing. Many of our competitors, including many of the organizations named above, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. 
 
We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates, if approved for marketing, are likely to be their safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement from government and third-party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payers seeking to encourage the use of generic products. Generic products that broadly address these indications are currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
 
Government Regulation and Federal Policy
 
Government authorities in the U.S. (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
FDA Regulation
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 
●completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations. Preclinical testing generally includes evaluation of our product candidates in the laboratory or in animals to characterize the product and determine safety and efficacy; 
 ●submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application ("IND"), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 
 ●performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 
 ●submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application ("NDA") after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
 ●a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 
 ●satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; 
 ●satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of one or more of the clinical sites at which the clinical trials were conducted; 
 ●at the discretion of the FDA, a public Advisory Committee Meeting where the data is reviewed by experts who discuss the data and give their opinion (which the FDA is not obliged to follow) of the adequacy of the data to support an approval; and 
 ●FDA review and approval of an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.

We rely, and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production, distribution, shipping and storage of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application (“CTA”) must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the U.S. is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
Cannabis Regulation
 
Although the Company intends to completely divest of its cannabis cultivation and production facilities, which will be complete upon the close of the sale of its Teco and Nopah facilities located in Las Vegas, Nevada, the Company has owned and operated and continues to own subsidiaries that are involved in the manufacturing and distribution of cannabis products under State law. These facilities have been and continue to be subject to prohibition under United States federal law.
 
Under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), the policies and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies are that cannabis (marijuana) is a Schedule 1 narcotic that is addictive and has no medical benefit. Accordingly, and a range of activities including cultivation and the personal use of cannabis is prohibited and subject to prosecution and criminal penalties. Unless and until Congress amends the CSA with respect to medical cannabis, there is a risk that the federal authorities may enforce current federal law, and we may be deemed to be engaged in producing, cultivating, or dispensing cannabis in violation of federal law, or we may be deemed to be facilitating the sale or distribution of drug paraphernalia in violation of federal law with respect to our Company’s business operations. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus indirectly and adversely affect our strategic goals, revenues and profits. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA in light of Congressional activity, judicial holdings, and stated federal policy remains uncertain. See “Risk Factors” below. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case brought by San Diego County, California that sought to establish federal preemption over state medical cannabis laws. The preemption claim was rejected by every court that reviewed the case. The California 4th District Court of Appeals wrote in its unanimous ruling, “Congress does not have the authority to compel the states to direct their law enforcement personnel to enforce federal laws.” However, in another case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, as long as the CSA contains prohibitions against cannabis, under the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, the United States may criminalize the production and use of cannabis even where states approve its use for medical purposes.
 
In an effort to provide guidance to federal law enforcement, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has issued Guidance Regarding Cannabis Enforcement to all United States attorneys in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General David Ogden on October 19, 2009, in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on June 29, 2011 and in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013. Each memorandum provides that the DOJ is committed to the enforcement of the CSA, but, the DOJ is also committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent and rational way.

The August 29, 2013 memorandum provides updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement in light of state laws legalizing medical and recreational cannabis possession in small amounts.
 
The memorandum sets forth certain enforcement priorities that are important to the federal government:
 

• | Distribution of cannabis to children;
--+--------------------------------------


• | Revenue from the sale of cannabis going to criminals;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Diversion of medical cannabis from states where it is legal to states where it is not;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Using state authorized cannabis activity as a pretext of another illegal drug activity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing violence in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing drugged driving;
--+----------------------------


• | Growing cannabis on federal property; and
--+------------------------------------------


• | Preventing possession or use of cannabis on federal property.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions revoked the Ogden Memo and the Cole Memos.
 
The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of cannabis for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address cannabis activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical cannabis and recreational cannabis in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits. Furthermore, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical cannabis.
 
In contrast to federal policy, the majority of U.S. states, four U.S. territories, and the District of Columbia have laws and/or regulations that recognize, in one form or another, legitimate medical uses for cannabis and adult recreational use of cannabis. Many other states are considering similar legislation.
