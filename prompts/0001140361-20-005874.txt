Standard Diversified Inc. (f/k/a Standard Diversified Opportunities Inc., Special Diversified Opportunities Inc. and Strategic Diagnostics Inc.) (“SDI”), a holding company until June 1, 2017, and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1990. On June 1, 2017, SDI consummated a Contribution and Exchange Transaction (“Contribution and Exchange”) to acquire a 52.1% controlling interest in Turning Point Brands, Inc. (“Turning Point”). The transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization or reverse acquisition. Turning Point was the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. As a result of the consummation of the Contribution and Exchange, SDI is no longer a shell company. As of December 31, 2019, SDI had a 50.0% ownership interest in Turning Point.
 
We are a diversified holding company with interests in a variety of industries and market sectors. Our subsidiaries are engaged in the following lines of business:
 
  
• | Other tobacco products ((Turning Point), a 50.0% owned subsidiary);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Outdoor advertising (Standard Outdoor LLC (“Standard Outdoor”), a wholly-owned subsidiary), beginning in July 2017; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Insurance (Pillar General Inc. (“Pillar General”), a wholly-owned subsidiary), beginning in January 2018 and disposed of on February 13, 2020.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We are continually evaluating our portfolio of subsidiaries and lines of business and may make investment and divestiture decisions that could materially impact us and any of our existing or future lines of business. This may include investment and divestiture decisions, such as our plans to pursue a corporate reorganization with Turning Point, as we disclosed in a press release issued on November 18, 2019, which was filed as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the same date. The reorganization is expected to consist of a statutory merger implemented via Delaware law pursuant to which we would be merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Turning Point with Turning Point as the survivor of the merger. Pursuant to the merger, which would be designed to constitute a tax-free “downstream reorganization” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders of our common stock would receive, in turn, for their SDI common stock, shares of Turning Point common stock. There can be no assurance that any definitive agreement will be executed or that any transaction will be approved or consummated. In the same press release, we also announced our intent to dispose of (i) our interest in Maidstone Insurance Company (“Maidstone”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pillar General through a disposition to the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYSDFS”), and (ii) our out-of-home advertising business, conducted through our subsidiary Standard Outdoor. The liquidation of Maidstone was approved by the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Nassau (the “Court”) on February 13, 2020, as of which date the control and assets of Maidstone vested with the New York State Liquidation Bureau (“NYS Liquidation Bureau”) and were no longer under our control. All Maidstone assets and liabilities were removed from our financial statements as of February 13, 2020. Our out-of-home advertising business has not yet been disposed of, however, the expectation is that it will be disposed of in the first half of 2020. See Note 29, “Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements included in this filing for further information. There can be no assurance that our plans will result in the approval or completion of any particular transaction in the future.

Turning Point
 
Turning Point is a leading, independent provider of Other Tobacco Products (“OTP”) in the U.S. Turning Point estimates the OTP industry generated approximately $11.5 billion of manufacturer revenue in 2019. In contrast to manufactured cigarettes, which have been experiencing declining volumes for decades based on data published by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), the OTP industry is demonstrating increased consumer appeal with low to mid-single digit consumer unit growth as reported by Management Science Associates, Inc. (“MSAi”), a third-party analytics and information company. Turning Point was the 6th largest competitor in terms of total OTP consumer units sold during 2019. Turning Point sells a wide range of products across the OTP spectrum; however, Turning Point does not sell cigarettes. Turning Point’s portfolio of brands includes some of the most widely recognized names in the OTP industry, such as Zig-Zag®, Beech-Nut®, Stoker’s®, Trophy®, VaporBeast®, Solace®, and VaporFi®. Turning Point currently ships to approximately 800 distributors with an additional 100 secondary, indirect wholesalers in the U.S. that carry and sell its products. Turning Point operates in three segments: (i) Smokeless products, (ii) Smoking products, and (iii) NewGen products.
 
Turning Point has identified additional growth opportunities in the emerging alternatives market. In January 2019, Turning Point established its subsidiary, Nu-X Ventures (“Nu-X”), a new company and wholly owned subsidiary dedicated to the development, production and sale of alternative products and acquisitions in related spaces. The creation of Nu-X allows Turning Point to leverage its expertise in traditional OTP management to alternative products. The Turning Point management team has over 100 years of experience navigating federal, state and local regulations that are directly applicable to the growing alternatives market. In July 2019, Turning Point acquired the assets of Solace Technology (“Solace”). Solace is an innovative product development company which is established as one of the top e-liquid brands and has since grown into a leader in alternative products. Solace’s legacy and innovation will enhance Nu-X’s strong and nimble development engine. In July 2019, Turning Point acquired a 30% stake in ReCreation Marketing (“ReCreation”). ReCreation is a specialty marketing and distribution firm focused on building brands in the Canadian smoking and alternative products categories. The investment will leverage ReCreation’s significant expertise in marketing and distributing tobacco and cannabis products throughout Canada. Turning Point plans to make additional investments, partnerships and acquisitions to drive the business of Nu-X. These endeavors will enable Turning Point to continue to identify unmet customer needs and provide quality products that it believes will result in genuine customer satisfaction and foster the growth of revenue.
 
Turning Point believes there are meaningful opportunities to grow through acquisitions and joint ventures across all product categories. As of December 31, 2019, Turning Point’s products are available in approximately 185,000 U.S. retail locations which, with the addition of retail stores in Canada, brings the total North American retail presence to an estimated 210,000 points of distribution. Turning Point’s sales team targets widespread distribution to all traditional retail channels, including convenience stores.
 
Smokeless Segment
 
Turning Point’s Smokeless segment includes both loose-leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff tobacco (“MST”). The Smokeless focus brand is Stoker’s in both chewing tobacco and MST. Stoker’s® chewing tobacco has grown considerable share over the last several years and is presently the #1 discount brand and the second largest brand in the industry, with approximately a 20% market share. Turning Point’s status in the chew market is further strengthened by Beech-Nut®, the #3 premium brand and #7 overall, as well as Trophy®, Durango®, and the five Wind River Brands acquired in 2016. Collectively, the company is the #2 marketer of chewing tobacco with approximately 29% market share. Turning Point’s chewing tobacco operations are facilitated through its long-standing relationship with Swedish Match, the manufacturer of Turning Point’s loose-leaf chewing tobaccos.1
 
In MST, Stoker’s remains among the fastest growing brands and holds an 8.1% share in the stores with distribution and a 4.5% share of the total U.S. MST market. Stoker’s pioneered the large 12 oz. tub packaging format and is manufactured using a proprietary process that Turning Point thinks results in a superior product. In late 2015, Turning Point extended the Stoker’s® MST franchise to include traditional 1.2 oz. cans to broaden retail availability. Turning Point’s proprietary manufacturing process is conducted at its Dresden, Tennessee, plant and packaged in both its Dresden, Tennessee, and Louisville, Kentucky facilities.1
 
Smoking Segment
 
Turning Point’s Smoking segment principally includes cigarette papers and Make-Your-Own (“MYO”) cigar wraps. The iconic strength of the Zig-Zag® brand drives Turning Point’s leadership position in both the cigarette papers and MYO cigar wrap markets. In cigarette papers, Zig-Zag® is the #1 premium cigarette paper in the U.S. with approximately 35% total market share. Management estimates also indicate that Zig-Zag® is the #1 brand in the promising Canadian market. Cigarette paper operations are aided by Turning Point’s sourcing relationships with Bolloré.1

In MYO cigar wraps, the Zig-Zag® brand commands about three-quarters of the market and continues to innovate in novel ways, including Turning Point’s recent introduction of Zig-Zag® ‘Rillo sized wraps which are similar in size to cigarillos, the most popular and fastest growing type of machine-made cigars. MYO cigar wraps operations are facilitated by Turning Point’s long-standing commercial relationship with the patent holder, Durfort.1
 
NewGen Segment
 
Turning Point’s NewGen segment includes its Nu-X subsidiary dedicated to the development, production and sale of alternative products as well as its various acquisitions in the vape space. Nu-X is dedicated to the development, production and sale of alternative products, which efforts were enhanced by the acquisition of Solace in July 2019. VaporBeast is a leading distributor of vapor products servicing the non-traditional retail channel. International Vapor Group and its subsidiaries (collectively, “IVG”), operate a strong B2C eCommerce business with direct sales to consumers nationwide and abroad through the Direct-Vapor and VaporFi brands. Refer to Note 3, “Acquisitions” to the consolidated financial statements included in this filing for further details regarding these acquisitions. In late summer 2019, the vapor market experienced a significant disruption relating to news regarding consumer illnesses and, thereafter, the FDA flavor regulation announcement. As a result, on November 1, 2019, Turning Point announced its intention to evaluate strategic alternatives as they relate to the vapor business and implemented a restructuring effort to right-size the business, including a company-wide workforce reduction of ten percent and the consolidation of warehouses, elimination of unprofitable platforms and store closures. Coinciding with the restructuring announcement, Turning Point communicated its intention to pivot from the third-party vaping business and to focus sales and marketing resources on its proprietary brands.
 
Standard Outdoor
 
Standard Outdoor is an out-of-home advertising business. As of December 31, 2019, we owned, managed and operated 399 billboard faces located across Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas. We acquired 387 of these billboard faces in 2018. Revenues include outdoor advertising revenues, while operating expenses primarily include compensation costs, depreciation and rent expense.
 
As discussed above, we have announced plans to divest Standard Outdoor.
 
Pillar General
 
On January 2, 2018, Pillar General acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Interboro Holdings, Inc. (“Interboro”) for a cash purchase price of $2.5 million. Under the name Maidstone Insurance Company, Maidstone offered personal automobile and homeowner’s insurance, primarily in the state of New York.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $0.8 million and $2.0 million related to the full impairment of the goodwill and intangible asset balances, respectively, in our Insurance segment. This impairment was a result of changes in the future outlook for the Insurance segment and certain other factors impacting recoverability, identified in the first quarter of 2019. As a result, there are no goodwill or intangible assets balances remaining in our Insurance segment.
 
In addition, Maidstone is subject to certain risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements as specified by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). Under such requirements, the amount of capital and surplus maintained by a property and casualty insurance company is to be determined on various risk factors including risk-based capital ratios. In August 2019, the Company reported a negative statutory capital and surplus to the NYSDFS. The NYSDFS requested that the Company consent to the entry of an order of liquidation pursuant to Article 74 of the New York Consolidated Insurance Law (“Order of Liquidation”) to effect a liquidation of the Company by the NYSDFS. On August 7, 2019, Maidstone consented to the filing of a petition for the entry of an Order of Liquidation with the NYSDFS.
 
 On January 14, 2020, the NYSDFS filed a petition for an Order of Liquidation in the Court with respect to Maidstone. On January 21, 2020, the Court issued an order to show cause establishing February 13, 2020 as the date of a hearing before the Court with respect to the Order of Liquidation. On February 13, 2020, the Court conducted a hearing with respect to the Order of Liquidation and, thereafter, approved the Order of Liquidation. At such time, the control and assets of Maidstone vested with the NYS Liquidation Bureau and were no longer under our control. All Maidstone assets and liabilities were removed from our financial statements as of February 13, 2020. See Note 29, “Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements included in this filing for further information.

 
Turning Point’s Competitive Strengths
 
We believe Turning Point’s competitive strengths include the following:
 
 6
 
Large, Leading Brands with Significant Scale
 
Turning Point has built a portfolio of leading brands with significant scale that are well recognized by consumers, retailers, and wholesalers. Turning Point’s Stoker’s® and Zig-Zag® brands are each well established and date back 80 and 120 years, respectively. The NewGen segment has been built primarily through the acquisitions of Solace, VaporBeast and IVG, leading sellers of e-liquids, devices, and accessories.

• | Stoker’s® is the #2 loose-leaf chewing tobacco brand and among the fastest growing MST brands in the industry. Turning Point manufactures Stoker’s® MST using only 100% American Leaf, utilizing a proprietary process to produce what Turning Point believes is a superior product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Zig-Zag® is the #1 premium cigarette paper brand in the U.S., with significant distribution in Canada. Zig-Zag® is also the #1 MYO cigar wrap brand in the U.S., as measured by MSAi. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Turning Point believes the Stoker’s® brand is seen as an innovator in both the loose-leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff markets. Zig-Zag® is an iconic brand and has strong, enduring brand recognition among a wide audience of consumers. The Solace acquisition provides Turning Point with a proven line of e-liquid and a strong new product development platform from which Turning Point intends to launch additional novel products, including a variety of actives. VaporBeast is a powerful distribution engine that allows Turning Point to further penetrate non-traditional retail outlets. IVG provides Turning Point direct access to the highly attractive, high margin B2C segment via the flagship VaporFi® brand.
 
Successful Track Record of New Product Launches and Category Expansions
 
Turning Point has successfully launched new products and entered new product categories by leveraging the strength of its brands. Turning Point methodically targets markets which it believes have significant growth potential. Turning Point has been successful in entering new product categories by extending existing products and brands in addition to introducing new products:

• | Turning Point has leveraged the proud legacy and value of the Stoker’s® brand to introduce a 12 oz. MST tub, a product whose size was not offered by any other market participant at the time of introduction. Stoker’s® MST has been among the fastest growing moist snuff brands in the industry in terms of pounds sold. While competitors have introduced larger format tub packaging, the early entry and differentiation of the Stoker’s® product have firmly established Turning Point as the market leader with over 50% of the Tub market. In third quarter 2015, Turning Point introduced Stoker’s® MST in 1.2 oz. cans to further expand retail penetration, particularly in convenience stores. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In 2009, Turning Point extended the Zig-Zag® tobacco brand into the MYO cigar wraps market and captured a 50% market share within the first two years. Turning Point is now the market share leader for MYO cigar wraps with approximately a 75% share. Turning Point believes its success was driven by the Zig-Zag® tobacco branding, which it feels is widely understood by consumers to represent a favorable, customizable experience ideally suited to MYO products. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In 2019 Turning Point launched the Nu-X brand focused on product development in the alternative market including cannabidiol isolate (“CBD”).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | VaporBeast quickly established itself as a leading marketer and distributor of liquid vapor products to the non-traditional retail universe. With its national footprint, VaporBeast is leveraging its regional consumer preference insights to further accelerate sales advances. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The IVG acquisition, and specifically the VaporFi B2C marketing engine, offers Turning Point the opportunity to leverage the marketing competencies and processes to sell novel proprietary products across multiple channels and platforms. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Solace acquisition in 2019 provided Turning Point with a leading line of liquids and a powerful new product development platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Turning Point strategically targets product categories that it believes demonstrate significant growth potential and for which the value of its brands is likely to have a meaningful impact. Turning Point believes that its track record and existing portfolio of brands provide growth advantages as it continues to evaluate opportunities to extend its product lines and expand into new categories.

Extensive Distribution Network and Data Driven Sales Organization
 
Turning Point has taken important steps to enhance its selling and distribution network and consumer marketing capabilities while keeping its capital expense requirements relatively low. Turning Point services its traditional tobacco and vapor customer bases with an experienced sales and marketing organization of approximately 178 professionals who possess in-depth knowledge of the OTP market. Turning Point extensively uses data supported by leading technology to enable its salesforce to analyze changing trends and effectively identify evolving consumer preferences at the store level. Turning Point subscribes to a sales tracking system provided by MSAi that measures all OTP product shipments by all market participants, on a weekly basis, from approximately 900 wholesalers to over 250,000 traditional retail stores in the U.S. This system enables Turning Point to understand share and volume trends across multiple categories at the individual store level, allowing it to allocate field salesforce coverage to the highest opportunity stores, thereby enhancing the value of new store placements and sales activity. Within the Stoker’s product categories, Turning Point has seen a positive correlation between the frequency of store calls by its salesforce and its retail market share. As the initial sales effort is critical to the success of a product launch, Turning Point believes its experienced salesforce, expansive distribution network, and leading market analytics put it in a strong position to swiftly execute new product launches in response to evolving consumer and market preferences.
Long-standing, Strong Relationships with an Established Set of Producers
 
As part of Turning Point’s asset-light operating model, Turning Point built long-standing and extensive relationships with leading, high-quality producers. In 2019, Turning Point’s three most important suppliers were:

• | Swedish Match, which manufactures Turning Point’s loose-leaf chewing tobacco;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bolloré, which provides Turning Point with exclusive access to the Zig-Zag® cigarette paper and accessories brand for the U.S. and Canada; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Durfort, from which Turning Point sources its MYO cigar wraps.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------



By outsourcing the production of products that represent more than 80% of Turning Point’s net sales to a select group of suppliers with whom Turning Point has strong relationships, Turning Point is able to maintain low overhead costs and minimal capital expenditures, which together drive its margins.
 
Experienced Management Team
 
With an average of approximately 26 years of consumer products experience, including an average of 24 years in the tobacco industry, Turning Point’s senior management team has enabled it to grow and diversify its business while improving operational efficiency. Members of management have previous experience at other leading tobacco companies, including Altria Group, Inc. (formerly Philip Morris); Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company (now Liggett Group, a subsidiary of Vector Group ltd); Swedish Match; and American Brands, Inc. Given the professional experience of the senior management team, Turning Point is able to analyze risks and opportunities from a variety of perspectives. Turning Point’s senior leadership has embraced a collaborative culture in which the combined experience, analytical rigor, and creativity are leveraged to assess opportunities and deliver products that satisfy consumers’ demands.
Turning Point’s Growth Strategies
 
Turning Point is focused on building sustainable margin streams, expanding the availability of Turning Point’s products, developing new products through innovation, and enhancing overall operating efficiencies with the goal of improving margins and cash flow. Turning Point adopted the following strategies to drive growth in its business and build stockholder value:
Grow Share of Existing Product Lines, Domestically and Internationally
 
Turning Point intends to remain a consumer centric organization with an innovative view and understanding of the OTP market. Turning Point believes there are meaningful opportunities for growth within the OTP market and in the emerging alternatives market which includes CBD. Turning Point expects to continue to identify unmet consumer needs and provide quality products that Turning Point believes will result in genuine consumer satisfaction and foster the growth of revenue. Turning Point maintains a robust product pipeline and plan to strategically introduce new products in attractive, growing OTP segments, both domestically and internationally. For example, in addition to Turning Point’s successful launch of Stoker’s® smaller 1.2 oz. MST cans, Turning Point believes there are opportunities for new products in the MST pouch and MYO cigar wrap markets. CBD products in the NewGen products segment are currently in Turning Point’s pipeline. Turning Point believes it has successfully built strong, powerful brands possessing significant potential.
 
 8
 
In 2019, less than 5% of Turning Point’s revenues were generated outside of the U.S. Having established a strong infrastructure and negotiated relationships across multiple segments and products, Turning Point is pursuing an international growth strategy to broaden sales and strengthen margins. Turning Point believes international sales represent a meaningful growth opportunity. Turning Point’s goals include expanding its presence in the worldwide OTP industry on a targeted basis. For example, Turning Point is selling its Stoker’s® MST products in South America and expanding Zig-Zag’s retail penetration and product assortment in Canada.
 
Expand into Adjacent Categories through Innovation and New Partnerships
 
Turning Point continually evaluates opportunities to expand into adjacent product categories by leveraging its current portfolio or through new partnerships. In 2009, Turning Point leveraged the Zig-Zag® tobacco brand and introduced Zig-Zag® MYO cigar wraps with favorable results. Turning Point now commands the #1 market share position for that segment. Turning Point is currently expanding its MYO cigar wraps business through the expansion of hemp cigar wraps which are similar to traditional cigar wraps, but are made of fine quality hemp, lack any tobacco or nicotine and, therefore, are not subject to federal excise tax. Additionally, Turning Point leveraged the substantial value equity in Stoker’s to launch a highly differentiated and proprietary MST product that remains among the fastest growing brands in the category. Turning Point has identified a number of new adjacencies and Turning Point intends to leverage its existing brands and partnerships to continue the process of commercializing winning products that satisfy consumer needs.
 
Continue to Grow a Strong NewGen Platform
 
The OTP category is continually evolving as consumers actively seek out new products and product forms. Given this market demand, Turning Point has developed a NewGen product platform which it believes will serve new and evolving consumer demands across multiple product categories.
 
Moving forward, Turning Point has identified additional opportunities in both CBD and other actives which it intends to take to market under its newly established subsidiary, Nu-X. Through Turning Point’s partnership with Canadian American Standard Hemp Inc. (“CASH”) and the keen insights it has attained in the alternative channel space over the last several years, Turning Point intends to fully leverage the total Turning Point infrastructure to place novel Nu-X products at retail and online via its B2C expertise.
 
Turning Point believes the categories within its NewGen segment are poised to be the key industry growth drivers in the future, and Turning Point is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. Turning Point intends to continue to pursue growth of its NewGen product platform by offering unique and innovative products to address evolving consumer demands.
 
Strategically Pursue Acquisitions
 
Turning Point believes there are meaningful acquisition opportunities in the fragmented OTP space. Turning Point regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities across the OTP landscape. In evaluating acquisition opportunities, Turning Point’s focus is on identifying acquisitions that strengthen its current distribution platform and product offerings or enable category expansion in areas with high growth potential.
 
Substantially all of Turning Point’s 2019 U.S. gross profit was derived from sales of products currently regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Center for Tobacco Products. Turning Point has significant experience in complying with the FDA regulatory regime with a compliance infrastructure composed of legal and scientific professionals. Turning Point believes many smaller OTP manufacturers currently lack this infrastructure, which it believes is necessary to comply with the broad scope of FDA regulations. Turning Point believes its regulatory compliance infrastructure, combined with its skilled management and strong distribution platform, position it to act as a consolidator within the OTP industry.
 
Turning Point has a strong track record of enhancing its OTP business with strategic and accretive acquisitions. For example, Turning Point’s acquisition of the North American Zig-Zag® cigarette papers distribution rights in 1997 has made Turning Point the #1 premium cigarette paper brand in the U.S., as measured by MSAi. Perhaps more importantly, Turning Point owns the Zig-Zag® tobacco trademark in the U.S. and have leveraged this asset effectively with approximately 52% of Turning Point’s total 2019 Zig-Zag branded net sales under its own Zig-Zag® marks rather than those Turning Point licenses from Bolloré. In 2003, Turning Point acquired the Stoker’s® brand. Turning Point has since built the brand to a strong #2 position in the chewing tobacco industry while successfully leveraging the brand’s value through its MST expansion where it remains among the fastest growing MST brands in the industry. More recently, Turning Point has completed a series of acquisitions since its IPO in 2016 including (i) smokeless tobacco brands from Wind River, (ii) VaporBeast, (iii) IVG and (iv) Solace. Additionally, Turning Point’s strategic minority interest in CASH gives Turning Point access to a pipeline of novel CBD products that it believes will be a dynamic force in the industry. Additionally, Turning Point’s investment in ReCreation Marketing in Canada is expected to accelerate Zig-Zag’s growth through alternative channel penetration.

Maintain Lean, Low-Cost Operating Model
 
Turning Point has a lean, asset-light manufacturing and sourcing model which requires low capital expenditures and utilizes outsourced supplier relationships. Turning Point believes its asset-light model provides marketplace flexibility and allows it to achieve favorable margins. Turning Point’s market analytics allow it to efficiently and effectively address evolving consumer and market demands. Turning Point’s supplier relationships allows it to increase the breadth of its product offerings and quickly enter new OTP markets as management is able to focus on brand building and innovation. Turning Point intends to continue to optimize its asset-light operating model as it grows in order to maintain a low cost of operations and healthy margins. In 2019, over 80% of Turning Point’s net sales were derived from outsourced production operations. Turning Point’s capital expenditures have ranged between $1.6 million and $4.8 million per year over the previous 5 years. Turning Point does not intend to outsource its MST production as a result of its proprietary manufacturing processes which are substantively different than those of its competitors.
Raw Materials, Product Supply, and Inventory Management
 
Turning Point sources its products through a series of longstanding, highly valued relationships which allow it to conduct its business on an asset-light, distribution-focused basis.
 
The components of inventories were as follows as of:
 

 | December 31, | 
------------------------------------+--------------+-------
(In thousands) | 2019 | | | 2018 | 
Raw materials and work in process | $ | 7,050 | | | $ | 2,722 | 
Leaf tobacco | | 32,763 | | | | 34,977 | 
Finished goods - Smokeless products | | 5,680 | | | | 6,321 | 
Finished goods - Smoking products | | 13,138 | | | | 14,666 | 
Finished goods - NewGen products | | 17,111 | | | | 37,194 | 
Other | | 989 | | | | 738 | 
Gross inventory | | 76,731 | | | | 96,618 | 
LIFO reserve | | (5,752 | ) | | | (5,381 | )
Net inventory | $ | 70,979 | | | $ | 91,237 | 

Smokeless Products
 
Turning Point’s loose-leaf chewing and moist snuff tobaccos are produced from air-cured and fire-cured leaf tobacco, respectively. Turning Point utilizes recognized suppliers that generally maintain 12- to 24-month supplies of its various types of tobacco at their facilities. Turning Point does not believe it is dependent on any single country or supplier source for tobacco. Turning Point generally maintains up to a two-month supply of finished, loose-leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff. This supply is maintained at its Louisville, Kentucky, facility and in two regional public warehouses to facilitate distribution.
 
Turning Point also utilizes a variety of suppliers for the sourcing of additives used in its smokeless products and for the supply of its packaging materials. Thus, Turning Point believes it is not dependent on a single supplier for these products. There are no current U.S. federal regulations that restrict tobacco flavor additives in smokeless products. The additives that Turning Point uses are food-grade, generally accepted ingredients.
 
All of Turning Point’s loose-leaf chewing tobacco production is fulfilled through its agreement with Swedish Match. See “Distribution and Supply Agreements” below for Turning Point’s discussion of the Swedish Match Manufacturing Agreement. All of the moist snuff products are manufactured at Turning Point’s facility in Dresden, Tennessee. Packaging occurs at the Dresden, Tennessee, location in addition to the facility in Louisville, Kentucky.
 
 10
 
Smoking Products
 
Pursuant to Turning Point’s distribution agreements with Bolloré (discussed in more detail, below, under the heading “Distribution and Supply Agreements”), Turning Point is required to purchase from Bolloré all cigarette papers, cigarette tubes, and cigarette injecting machines that it sells, subject to Bolloré fulfilling its obligations under these distribution agreements. If Bolloré is unable or unwilling to perform its obligations or ceases its cigarette paper manufacturing operations, in each case, as set forth in the Distribution Agreements, it may seek third-party suppliers and continue the use of the Zig-Zag® trademark to market these products. To ensure Turning Point has a steady supply of premium cigarette paper products, as well as cigarette tubes and injectors, Bolloré is required to maintain, at its expense, a two-month supply of inventory in a bonded, public warehouse in the U.S.
 
Turning Point obtains its MYO cigar wraps from the patent holder under its agreement with Durfort in the Dominican Republic. Turning Point also obtains its Zig-Zag branded cigar products from the Dominican Republic.
 
NewGen Products
 
Turning Point has sourcing relationships that are capable of providing liquid vapor products for other companies’ brands and for producing its own branded product lines in the category. Turning Point’s acquisitions of VaporBeast, IVG and Solace have (i) accelerated its entry into the non-traditional retail channel, where it believes a significant portion of CBD and liquid vapor products are sold; (ii) provided enhanced distribution of products; and (iii) established best-in-class distribution and B2C platforms combining eCommerce selling skills with a national, retail salesforce. Turning Point believes the VaporBeast B2B competency coupled with the IVG B2C selling strengths and its national retail salesforce is a genuine competitive advantage and one that it intends to leverage on behalf of Nu-X CBD and other actives products. Furthermore, Turning Point has established a sourcing group in Asia to ensure timely and cost-effective access to marketplace winners and new product launches, while also maximizing margin through thoughtful logistics strategies.
 
Distribution and Supply Agreements
 
Bolloré Distribution and License Agreements
 
Turning Point is party to two long-term distribution and license agreements with Bolloré with respect to sales of cigarette papers, cigarette tubes, and cigarette injector machines—one with respect to distribution in the U.S. and one with respect to distribution in Canada (collectively, the “Distribution Agreements”). Under the Distribution Agreements, Bolloré granted Turning Point the exclusive right to purchase products bearing the Zig-Zag® brand name from Bolloré for resale in the U.S. and Canada. Turning Point has the sole right to determine pricing and other terms upon which it may resell any products purchased from Bolloré, including the right to determine the ultimate distributors of such products within these countries. Furthermore, on March 19, 2013, Turning Point entered into an additional License and Distribution Agreement with Bolloré (the “Bolloré License Agreement”), which permits Turning Point the exclusive use of the Zig-Zag® brand name in the U.S. for e-cigarettes and any related accessories, including vaporizers and e-liquids. The Bolloré License Agreement terminates upon termination of the Distribution Agreements. Turning Point also entered into a License and Distribution Agreement with Bolloré permitting the exclusive use of the Zig-Zag brand in the U.S. and Canada for paper cone products. This agreement also terminates upon termination of the Distribution Agreements.
 
Each of the Distribution Agreements were entered into on November 30, 1992, by a predecessor in interest for an initial twenty-year term. The Distribution Agreements automatically renewed in November 2012 for a second twenty-year term and will automatically renew for successive twenty-year terms unless terminated in accordance with the provisions of such agreement. The Distribution Agreements provide that, in order to assure each of the parties receives commercially reasonable profits in light of inflationary trends and currency fluctuation factors, 120 days prior to December 31, 2004, and each fifth-year anniversary from such date thereafter, the parties are required to enter into good faith negotiations to agree on an index and currency adjustment formula to replace the index and formula currently in effect. If the parties are unable to agree, the dispute is to be submitted to binding arbitration. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreements, if at any time the price received by Bolloré fails to cover its costs, Bolloré may give Turning Point notice of this deficiency, and the parties must promptly negotiate in good faith to adjust prices. If the parties cannot agree on new prices, Turning Point may purchase products from an alternative supplier reasonably acceptable to Bolloré until the next price adjustment period (subject to certain price-matching rights available to Bolloré and other terms and conditions). Further, Bolloré sources its needs for Turning Point’s orders from an affiliate of one of Turning Point’s competitors. For further details, see “Risk Factors—Turning Point depends on a small number of key third-party suppliers and producers for its products.”

Pursuant to the Distribution Agreements, export duties, insurance, and shipping costs are the responsibility of Bolloré. Import duties and taxes in the U.S. and Canada are Turning Point’s responsibility. Under the Distribution Agreements, Turning Point must purchase cigarette papers, cigarette tubes, and cigarette injector machines from Bolloré, subject to Bolloré fulfilling its obligations under these agreements. Bolloré is required to provide Turning Point with the quantities of the products that Turning Point orders consistent with specific order-to-delivery timelines detailed in the agreement. The Distribution Agreements provide Turning Point with certain safeguards to ensure that Turning Point will be able to secure a steady supply of product, including (i) granting Turning Point the right to seek third-party suppliers with continued use of the Zig-Zag® trademark if Bolloré is unable to perform its obligations or ceases its cigarette paper manufacturing operation, in each case as set forth in the Distribution Agreements, and (ii) maintaining a two-month supply of safety stock inventory of the premium papers, tubes, and injector machines in the U.S. at Bolloré’s expense.
 
Under the Distribution Agreements, Turning Point has agreed that for a period of five years after the termination of the agreements Turning Point will not engage, directly or indirectly, in the manufacturing, selling, distributing, marketing, or otherwise promoting, in the U.S. and Canada, of cigarette paper or cigarette paper booklets of a competitor without Bolloré’s consent, except for certain de minimis acquisitions of debt or equity securities of such a competitor and certain activities with respect to an alternative supplier used by Turning Point as permitted under the Distribution Agreements.
 
Each of the Distribution Agreements permits Bolloré to terminate such agreement (i) if certain minimum purchases (which, in the case of both Distribution Agreements, have been significantly exceeded in recent years) of cigarette paper booklets have not been made by Turning Point for resale in the jurisdiction covered by such agreement within a calendar year, (ii) if Turning Point assigns such agreement without the consent of Bolloré, (iii) upon a change of control without the consent of Bolloré, (iv) upon certain acquisitions of Turning Point’s equity securities by one of its competitors or certain investments by Turning Point’s significant stockholders in one of its competitors, (v) upon certain material breaches, including Turning Point’s agreement not to promote, directly or indirectly, cigarette paper or cigarette paper booklets of a competitor, or (vi) upon Turning Point’s bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or other similar event. Additionally, the Canada Distribution Agreement is terminable by either Turning Point or Bolloré upon the termination of the U.S. Distribution Agreement.
 
Swedish Match Manufacturing Agreement
 
On September 4, 2008, Turning Point entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement with Swedish Match whereby Swedish Match became the exclusive manufacturer of Turning Point’s loose-leaf chewing tobacco. Under the agreement, production of Turning Point’s loose-leaf chewing tobacco products was completely transitioned to Swedish Match’s plant located in Owensboro, Kentucky, on September 18, 2009. Turning Point sources all of the tobacco Swedish Match uses to manufacture Turning Point’s products along with certain proprietary flavorings and retain all marketing, design, formula, and trademark rights over Turning Point’s loose-leaf products. Turning Point also has the right to approve all product modifications and are solely responsible for decisions related to package design and branding of the loose-leaf tobacco produced for Turning Point. Responsibilities related to process control, manufacturing activities, and inventory management with respect to Turning Point’s loose-leaf products are allocated between Turning Point and Swedish Match as specified in the agreement. Turning Point also has rights to monitor production and quality control processes on an ongoing basis.
 
The agreement had an initial ten-year term and will automatically be renewed for five successive ten-year terms unless either party provides at least 180 days’ notice prior to a renewal term of its intent to terminate the agreement, or unless otherwise terminated by mutual agreement of the parties in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. If a notice of non-renewal is delivered, the contract will expire two years after the date on which the agreement would have otherwise been renewed. The terms allow the agreement to be assumed by a buyer, terminated for uncured material breach, or terminated by Turning Point subject to a buyout. Turning Point also holds a right of first refusal to acquire the manufacturing plant as well as Swedish Match’s chewing tobacco unit. The agreement was automatically renewed for the first of five 10-year renewal periods on September 4, 2018.
 
Production and Quality Control
 
Turning Point primarily outsources its manufacturing and production processes and focus on packaging, marketing, and distribution. Turning Point currently manufactures less than 20% of its products as measured by net sales. Turning Point’s in-house manufacturing operations are principally limited to (i) the manufacturing of Turning Point’s moist snuff products, which occurs at its facility in Dresden, Tennessee; (ii) the packaging of Turning Point’s moist snuff products at its facilities in Dresden, Tennessee, and Louisville, Kentucky; and (iii) the manufacturing of e-liquids at Turning Point’s Louisville, Kentucky, facility. Turning Point’s MST products are processed in-house, rather than outsourced, as a result of its proprietary manufacturing processes which are substantively different than those of Turning Point’s competitors.
 
 12
 
Turning Point uses proprietary production processes and techniques, including strict quality controls. Turning Point’s quality control group routinely tests the quality of the tobacco, flavorings, application of flavorings, premium cigarette papers, tubes and injectors, cigars, MYO cigar wraps, liquid vapor products, and packaging materials. Turning Point utilizes sophisticated quality controls to test and closely monitor the quality of its products. The high quality of Turning Point’s tobacco products is largely the result of using high-grade tobacco leaf and food-grade flavorings and, on an ongoing basis, analyzing the tobacco cut, flavorings, and moisture content together with strict specifications for sourced products.
 
Given the importance of contract manufacturing to Turning Point’s business, Turning Point’s quality control group ensures that established, written procedures and standards are adhered to by each of its contract manufacturers. Responsibilities related to process control, manufacturing activities, quality control, and inventory management with respect to Turning Point’s loose-leaf are allocated between Turning Point and Swedish Match under the manufacturing agreement.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Turning Point has grown the size and capacity of its salesforce and intends to continue strengthening the organization to advance its ability to deepen and broaden the retail availability of Turning Point’s products and brands.
 
As of December 31, 2019, Turning Point had a nationwide sales and marketing organization of approximately 178 professionals. Turning Point’s sales and marketing group focuses on priority markets and sales channels and seeks to operate with a high level of efficiency. In 2019, Turning Point’s tobacco-related sales and marketing efforts enabled its products to reach an estimated 210,000 retail doors in North America and over 800 direct wholesale customers with an additional 100 secondary, indirect wholesalers in the U.S.
 
Turning Point’s tobacco sales efforts are focused on wholesale distributors and retail merchants in the independent and chain convenience store, tobacco outlet, food store, mass merchandising, drug store, and non-traditional retail channels. Turning Point’s NewGen sales efforts are focused on alternative channels and winning new stores, increasing store share of requirements and growing the B2C engine to capture a greater share of online sales direct to the consumer. Turning Point has expanded, and intends to continue to expand, the sales of its products into previously underdeveloped geographic markets and retail channels. In 2019, Turning Point derived more than 95% of its net sales from sales in the U.S., with the remainder primarily from sales in Canada.
 
Turning Point subscribes to a sales tracking system from MSAi that records all traditional OTP product shipments (Turning Point’s as well as those of its competitors) from approximately 900 wholesalers to over 250,000 traditional retail stores in the U.S. This system enables Turning Point to understand individual product share and volume trends across multiple categories down to the individual retail store level, allowing Turning Point to allocate field salesforce coverage to the highest opportunity stores. Additionally, the ability to select from a range of parameters and to achieve this level of granularity means Turning Point can analyze marketplace trends in a timely manner and swiftly evolve its business planning to meet market opportunities.
 
Turning Point employs marketing activities to grow awareness, trial, and sales including selective trade advertising to expand wholesale availability, point-of-sale advertising and merchandising and permanent and temporary displays to improve consumer visibility, and social media. Turning Point complies with all regulations relating to the marketing of tobacco products, such as directing marketing efforts to adult consumers, and is committed to full legal compliance in the sales and marketing of its products. To date, Turning Point has neither relied upon, nor conducted, any substantial advertising in the consumer media for its tobacco products.
 
In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Turning Point did not have any customer that accounted for 10% or more of its net sales. Turning Point’s customers use an open purchase order system to buy its products and are not obligated to do so pursuant to ongoing contractual obligations. Turning Point performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral on trade receivables. Historically, Turning Point has not experienced material credit losses. Sales to customers within the NewGen segment are generally prepaid.
 
Competition
 
Many of Turning Point’s competitors are better capitalized than Turning Point is and have greater resources, financial and otherwise. Turning Point believes its ability to effectively compete and strong market positions in its principal product lines are due to the high recognition of Turning Point’s brand names, the perceived quality of each of its products, and the efforts of Turning Point’s sales, marketing, and distribution teams. Turning Point competes against “big tobacco,” including Altria Group, Inc. (formerly Philip Morris); British American Tobacco p.l.c. (formerly Reynolds); Swedish Match; Swisher International; and manufacturers including U.K. based Imperial Brands, PLC, across its segments. “Big tobacco” has substantial resources and a customer base that has historically demonstrated loyalty to their brands.
 
 13
 
Competition in the OTP market is based upon not only brand quality and positioning but also on price, packaging, promotion, and retail availability and visibility. Given the decreasing prevalence of cigarette consumption, the “big tobacco” companies continue to demonstrate an increased interest and participation in a number of OTP markets.
 
Smokeless Products
 
Turning Point’s three principal competitors in the loose-leaf chewing tobacco market are Swedish Match, the American Snuff Company, LLC (a unit of British American Tobacco p.l.c.), and Swisher International Group, Inc. Turning Point believes moist snuff products are used interchangeably with loose-leaf products by many consumers. In the moist snuff category, Turning Point faces the same competitors with the addition of U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (a division of Altria Group, Inc.).
Smoking Products
 
Turning Point’s principle competitors for premium cigarette paper sales are Republic Tobacco, L.P. and HBI International. Turning Point’s two major competitors for its MYO cigar wraps are New Image Global, Inc., and Blunt Wrap USA. Turning Point believes MYO cigar wrap products are used interchangeably with both rolling papers and finished cigar products by many consumers.
 
NewGen Products
 
In the NewGen products segment, aside from the established operations of Juul Labs, Turning Point’s competitors are varied as the market is relatively new and highly fragmented. Turning Point’s direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to Turning Point’s products through the same channels in which it sells liquid vapor products. Turning Point competes with these direct competitors for sales through wholesalers and retailers including, but not limited to, vapor stores, national chain stores, tobacco shops, and convenience stores and in the online direct to consumer environment. Through Turning Point’s acquisitions, it now also competes directly with other non-traditional distributors and retailers.
 
Patents, Trademarks, and Trade Secrets
 
Turning Point has numerous registered trademarks relating to its products, including: Beech-Nut®, Trophy®, Havana Blossom®, Durango®, Stoker’s®, Tequila Sunrise®, Fred’s Choice®, Old Hillside®, Our Pride®, Red Cap®, Tennessee Chew®, Big Mountain®, Springfield Standard®, Snake River®, VaporBeast®, Vapor Shark®, DirectVapor®, VaporFi®, SouthBeachSmoke®, and Nu-X Ventures®. The registered trademarks, which are significant to Turning Point’s business, expire periodically and are renewable for additional 10-year terms upon expiration. Flavor and blend formula trade secrets relating to Turning Point’s tobacco products, which are key assets of Turning Point’s businesses, are maintained under strict secrecy.
 
The Zig-Zag® trade dress trademark for premium cigarette papers and related products are owned by Bolloré and have been exclusively licensed to Turning Point in the U.S. and Canada. The Zig-Zag® trademark for e-cigarettes is also owned by Bolloré and have been exclusively licensed to Turning Point in the U.S. Turning Point owns the Zig-Zag® trademark with respect to its use in connection with products made with tobacco including, without limitation, cigarettes, cigars, and MYO cigar wraps in the U.S.
 
Research and Development and Quality Assurance
 
Turning Point has a research and development and quality assurance function that tests raw materials and finished products in order to maintain a high level of product quality and consistency. Research and development largely base its new product development efforts on its high-tech data systems. Turning Point spent approximately $2.5 million on research and development and quality control efforts for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Standard Outdoor
 
Business Strategy
 
Standard Outdoor owns, manages and operates a total of 180 billboard structures, with 399 billboard faces, in Georgia and Florida (87 billboard structures), Alabama (82 billboard structures), South Carolina (3 billboard structures) and Texas (8 billboard structures). Typically, Standard Outdoor’s structures are positioned on properties that it leases with terms ranging from month-to-month to 99 years, often with renewal or extension options. Standard Outdoor’s lease obligations vary under these arrangements. Currently, Standard Outdoor is focused on an aggressive local sales effort with minimal national account business.
 
 14
 
Standard Outdoor inventory consists of traditional static outdoor advertising structures, where the client’s advertising copy is printed with computer-generated graphics on a single sheet of vinyl and wrapped around the display face, as well as fully automated, digital LED electronic displays. Standard Outdoor’s structures are located on major highways and secondary arteries targeting local and commuter vehicular traffic. Standard Outdoor’s contracts with advertisers range from one month to multiple years. In most cases, Standard Outdoor’s advertising displays have multiple faces.
 
Standard Outdoor typically owns the physical structures on which its clients’ advertising copy is displayed. Standard Outdoor acquires new structures from third parties and erects them on sites that it leases or for which it has acquired permanent easements. In addition to the site leases described above, Standard Outdoor generally must obtain from state or local government a permit to build and operate each billboard structure.
 
On November 18, 2019, we announced plans to divest our outdoor billboard business, conducted through Standard Outdoor, in a transaction not yet finalized.
 
Competition
 
The outdoor billboard industry is highly competitive. There is a concentration in the ownership of billboard structures in the geographic markets in which Standard Outdoor competes and significantly larger companies such as Clear Channel Outdoor Communications, OUTFRONT Media Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company, dominate the out-of-home advertising business. In addition, Standard Outdoor competes with other outdoor advertising solutions, including street furniture (for example, bus shelters and benches), transit and other alternative advertising signs.
Pillar General
 
Business Strategy
 
As of January 2, 2018, following the acquisition of Interboro, Pillar General entered the insurance business. Maidstone, a wholly owned subsidiary of Interboro, offers personal automobile and homeowner insurance, primarily in the State of New York.
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded impairment charges of $0.8 million and $2.0 million related to the full impairment of the goodwill and intangible asset balances, respectively, in our Insurance segment. This impairment was a result of changes in the future outlook for the Insurance segment and certain other factors impacting recoverability, identified in the first quarter of 2019. As a result, there are no goodwill or intangible assets balances remaining in our Insurance segment.

 
In addition, Maidstone is subject to certain RBC requirements as specified by the NAIC. Under such requirements, the amount of capital and surplus maintained by a property and casualty insurance company is to be determined on various risk factors including risk-based capital ratios. In August 2019, the Company reported a negative statutory capital and surplus to the NYSDFS. The NYSDFS requested that the Company consent to the entry of an Order of Liquidation to effect a liquidation of the Company by the NYSDFS. On August 7, 2019, Maidstone consented to the filing of a petition for the entry of an Order of Liquidation with the NYSDFS.
 
On January 14, 2020, the NYSDFS filed a petition for an Order of Liquidation in the Court with respect to Maidstone. On January 21, 2020, the Court issued an order to show cause establishing February 13, 2020 as the date of a hearing before the Court with respect to the Order of Liquidation. On February 13, 2020, the Court conducted a hearing with respect to the Order of Liquidation and, thereafter, approved the Order of Liquidation. At such time, the control and assets of Maidstone vested with the NYS Liquidation Bureau and were no longer under our control. All Maidstone assets and liabilities were removed from our financial statements as of February 13, 2020. See Note 29, “Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements included in this filing for further information.
 
Employees
 
Including our operating subsidiaries as described below, we employed approximately 499 persons at February 28, 2020. Turning Point employed 466 persons. Interboro employed 26 persons. Standard Outdoor employed seven persons. None of our employees are represented by unions. We believe we have a positive relationship with our employees.
