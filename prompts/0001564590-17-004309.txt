 The Company operates through two reportable segments: (i) Information Services and (ii) Performance Marketing. For additional information relating to our segments, see Note 16, “Segment Information” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Information Services—Leveraging leading-edge technology, proprietary algorithms, and massive datasets, and through intuitive and powerful analytical applications, we provide solutions to organizations within the risk management and consumer marketing industries. CORE is our next generation data fusion platform, providing mission-critical information about individuals, businesses and assets to a variety of markets and industries. Through machine learning and advanced analytics, our Information Services segment uses the power of data fusion to ingest and analyze data at a massive scale. The derived information from the data fusion process ultimately serves to generate unique solutions for banking and financial services companies, insurance companies, healthcare companies, law enforcement and government, the collection industry, law firms, retail, telecommunications companies, corporate security and investigative firms. In addition, our data acquisition solutions enable clients to rapidly grow their customer databases by using self-declared consumer insights to identify, connect with, and acquire first-party consumer data and multi-channel marketing consent at massive scale.
 Built in a secure payment card industry (PCI) compliant environment, our cloud-based next generation technology delivers greater than four 9s of service uptime. By leveraging our proprietary infrastructure design within the cloud, we currently operate in six datacenters spread geographically across the U.S. and are able to dynamically and seamlessly scale as needed. Using our intelligent framework, and leveraging a microservices architecture where appropriate, we reduce operational cost and complexity, thus delivering superior performance at greatly reduced costs compared to traditional datacenter architectures. Since the release of our CORE platform in May 2016, we have added billions of data records and continue to add over a billion records per month on average. Our average query response time for a comprehensive profile is less than 250 milliseconds versus competitive platforms that measure comprehensive profile response times in seconds.
 Performance Marketing—Our Agile Audience Engine drives our Performance Marketing segment, which provides solutions to help brands, advertisers and marketers find the right customers in every major business-to-consumer (B2C) vertical, including internet and telecommunications, financial services, health and wellness, consumer packaged goods, careers and education, and retail and entertainment. We deterministically target consumers across various marketing channels and devices, through the user-supplied acquisition of personally identifiable information on behalf of our clients, such as email addresses, other identifying information and 
 1


responses to dynamically populated survey questions. Additionally, 80% of our consumer interaction comes from mobile, a highly-differentiated characteristic compared to our competitors whose platforms are not mobile-first.
 We own hundreds of media properties, through which we engage millions of consumers everyday with interactive content, such as job postings, cost savings, surveys, promotions and sweepstakes that generate over 800,000 survey respondents and over 7 million compiled survey responses a day. Our owned media properties alone have created a database of approximately 130 million U.S. adults with detailed profiles, including 224 million unique email addresses, across over 75 million households. With meaningful people-based interaction that focuses on consumer behavior and declared first-party data, leveraged on a mobile-centric platform that provides seamless omni-channel capabilities, we have the ability to target and develop comprehensive consumer profiles that redefine the way advertisers view their most valuable customers.
 For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had revenue of $186.8 million, $14.1 million and $0.8 million, gross profit of $53.0 million, $3.8 million and $0.5 million, a net loss of $29.1 million, $84.5 million and $0.6 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $15.0 million, negative $6.6 million and negative $0.4 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, adding back net loss from discontinued operations, interest expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, share-based payments, and other adjustments, as noted in the tables included in “Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 Our Markets
 The target markets for our data and analytical solutions today consist primarily of businesses within the risk management and consumer marketing industries.
 International Data Corporation, a global provider of market intelligence and advisory services, estimates, in an October 2016 study, that worldwide business analytics services and software spending will be $130.1 billion in 2016 and is expected to be $203.0 billion in the year 2020, representing a CAGR of 11.7% from 2016—2020. The big data and analytics sector continues to grow at an accelerated pace due to the proliferation of data generated by technological advancements and changing consumer behavior. Continued, rapid adoption and use of smartphones and other mobile devices, social media and online purchasing channels, and the necessity of organizations to sort through this sea of data to glean actionable intelligence to support their daily operations, serve as key drivers of the sector’s growth.
 Risk management and fraud analytics has become increasingly important not only in the banking and financial services sectors but across multiple other industries and use cases. According to the market research company MarketsAndMarkets, the North American risk analytics software market was projected to be $8.6 billion in 2016. Data fusion analytics and the information derived therefrom is now the primary service product for risk management associated with key purchasers such as banking and financial services companies, insurance companies, healthcare companies, law enforcement and government, collection agencies, law firms, retail, telecommunications companies and private investigative firms. Primary use cases include, but are not limited to, obtaining information on consumers, businesses and assets (and their interrelationships) to facilitate the location of individuals and assets, identity verification, and to support criminal, legal, financial, insurance, and corporate investigations, due diligence and the assessment of counterparty risk.
 According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)’s “Internet Advertising Revenue Report, 2016 first half results,” total digital ad spend in the U.S. was $32.7 billion for the first half of 2016, a 19.1% increase over the first half 2015. Mobile was the leading ad format accounting for 45% of revenues, and performance-based advertising was the leading pricing model accounting for 65% of total U.S. digital advertising spending.
 Consumer marketing, which consists of paid advertising, public relations, sales strategy, customer communications and market research, is a multi-trillion-dollar global industry. Digital marketing is the fastest growing subset of this marketplace, with performance marketing being the most dominant format utilized across the industry. Advertisers prefer performance marketing because they only pay when specific actions are completed by consumers in response to their ads, such as making purchases, filling out information request forms, or clicking through to websites. In addition, performance marketing campaigns that target registered and validated consumers are referred to as “people-based” marketing campaigns, and are gaining favor over cookie-based campaigns which target anonymous site visitors. People-based performance marketing campaigns improve the effectiveness of advertising, increase return on ad spend, and facilitate the deterministic targeting of consumers across digital channels such as display, social, search, video and addressable television.
 According to eMarketer’s, a leading market research company, worldwide spend on paid media will climb to $542.6 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow to $674.2 billion by 2020, representing a CAGR of 5.6%. Ad spend sector growth is attributable to the 
 2


growing diversity in media content and sources, and although growth will vary by region, North America is projected to remain the number one advertising region in the world.
 Companies in all industries are inundated with data sourced from a growing number of digital mediums including e-commerce, mobile and social media, which provide new information on a daily basis. Companies struggle to parse through the data available to them to make decisions in real-time that improve scale and efficiency while helping them achieve and exceed their strategic goals. Our platforms and analytical capabilities directly address these issues in an industry agnostic manner to solve complex problems in a robust and growing marketplace.
 Key Challenges Facing our Customers
 We believe our solutions address the challenges that the industry faces today, which include:
 Actionable Big Data Insights Through A Single Platform—As the velocity and volume of data continues to grow exponentially, enterprises have become overwhelmed with data and their inability to glean intelligence from such data to derive successful business decisions in real-time. Customers demand full-suite, turn-key solutions that are agile, flexible, and available on-demand in order to gain the speed, scale and insight necessary to drive their business models. As the breadth and depth of data increases, providers will need to deploy new technologies that enable both the ingestion of data at massive scale in real-time, irrespective of structure or form, and the analytics components necessary to function across multiple channels. The continued digitization of human interactions, and the corresponding availability of the data resulting therefrom, is driving demand for data capture, management and analysis software. As a result, customers are looking for flexible and efficient solutions to fuse disparate sets of not only transactional data but also demographic, ethnographic and behavioral data as well, in order to provide insights that are truly actionable.
 Engaging Customers Across All Devices—According to the IAB, mobile advertising in the U.S. totaled $15.5 billion for the first half of 2016, a 89% increase from first half 2015. This impressive growth demonstrates to advertisers the importance of mobile interaction as they search for ways to engage consumers and effectively gather critical data. Developing capabilities to acquire data from all devices and creating omni-channel advertising campaigns are both costly and complex. Traditional cookie-based targeting has proven less effective as support for cookies on mobile devices is infrequent or non-existent, ushering in the need for newer approaches for reaching consumers across devices. Developing a full solution is complex and many offerings in the marketplace struggle to adequately address this growing need.
 Pricing Methodology—Historically, internet advertising has been sold on a cost-per-impression (CPM) model where an advertiser is charged each time an advertisement is displayed, regardless of user engagement with the advertisement. This dated methodology has made it difficult to truly gauge the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, and determine the actual costs associated with successful user engagement. Today’s advertising landscape now has several options for pricing advertisements, including the historical CPM method, as well as cost-per-click (CPC) which is most common in search advertising, cost-per-action (CPA), and hybrid models that may combine aspects of the various models. With chief marketing officers increasingly accountable for demonstrating concrete return on their marketing investments, CPA and CPC models are more favorable alternatives to CPM-based offerings.
 Cost and Performance Pressures—As our customers face constant cost pressures, they need to continually improve the value they receive from their information solutions. Whether it is marketing campaign spend or managing risk, consumers and customers are increasingly more sophisticated, requiring enhanced performance in order to satisfy their business objectives. Improving performance can mean delivering the right advertisement to the right consumer at the right time, or providing the most intuitive information as rapidly as possible to capitalize on opportunities or reduce risk. Superior data fusion with unique data sources delivers customers an advantage as they cope with these pressures.
 Difficult Delivery of Solutions for Complex Problems and Data Analytics at Scale—The larger and more complex a campaign or dataset, the more difficult it is to sustain the same level of performance and insight. The highly-fragmented nature of the internet display landscape, proliferation of data and lack of robust technology limits the ability to target the correct users on the correct device at the correct time and on the correct portal. There is an inherent need for solutions that allow advertisers to deliver high-performing campaigns regardless of size and duration.
Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe our leading-edge technology platforms, massive database of holistic views of consumers, and dynamic and intuitive solutions deliver differentiated capabilities to our customers. Our solutions enable our customers to make more informed inquiries regarding their problems and better decisions to solve their most complex problems. We believe the following competitive strengths will continue to deliver an unrivaled value proposition that further drives our differentiation:

Transformative and Innovative Technology Platforms—Through the convergence of our platforms, CORE and Agile Audience Engine, we offer a comprehensive suite of information solutions. Our cloud-based, data and industry agnostic platform, CORE, allows us to assimilate, structure, and fuse billions of disparate records to create comprehensive views of individuals and to present these views in real-time via analytical applications. We believe our platform’s speed, power, and scalability are key differentiators in the marketplace. Our Agile Audience Engine enables brands to target, engage, qualify, and communicate with relevant consumers across mobile, web and in-app content environments. Furthermore, we utilize proprietary targeting algorithms and a dynamic survey module to match consumers with the most relevant advertisers, content, and media across all devices. We optimize campaigns by leveraging each advertiser’s performance data. Most valuable customer profiles (MVCs), as determined by factors such as individual-level engagement with ads and/or conversion or purchasing histories, are used to fuel lookalike modeling enabling the targeting of individuals who share similar attributes to those MVCs. This results in broadening the scale of acquisition campaigns and enhancing campaign performance.
 Massive Database of Holistic Views of Consumers—Data is the lifeblood of our technology platforms. We leverage our CORE and Agile Audience Engine platforms to build massive proprietary datasets and apply analytics in real-time to provide actionable insights. Our Information Services data is compiled from a myriad of online and offline sources, both structured and unstructured, including public record data, publicly-available data, and proprietary data. Public record data includes personally identifiable information, as well as property, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, automotive, phone and other information aggregated from companies specializing in data aggregation, public record repositories, and publicly-available sources. Proprietary data includes data internally generated by proprietary algorithms and analytic processes as well as data which is compiled through our owned media properties, including valuable self-reported consumer information collected through voluntary surveys, promotions and contests. Through next-generation machine learning technology and proprietary algorithms, we efficiently ingest these datasets, structure them into common form, and utilize the process of data fusion to connect or fuse the data so as to create an actionable, real-time view of the data for various use cases, delivering greater intelligence to our customers and enhancing their decision-making capabilities across all markets and industries.
 In addition, our technology platforms and systems enable us to collect four distinct types of user data:
  
• | Meta-data—information gleaned by the system such as the user’s IP address, browser type, operating system, and, for mobile connected devices, the device model, device ID, browser, and mobile carrier;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demographic data—self-reported user information such as name, address, gender, email address and telephone number;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ethnographic data—user responses to dynamically curated and served survey questions; and,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Behavioral data—purchase history, interests, likes and dislikes, preferences and frequencies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also use our public record database and third-party services in order to verify and supplement collected data. This data is stored and analyzed, and can be further enhanced in real-time when consumers respond to dynamically populated survey questions, enabling precise targeting and profiling for ad serving and customer acquisition purposes. By using the system and the insights gained, we can develop deep and relevant insights into each individual consumer.
 Our platforms and user volume has enabled us to accumulate a massive, owned data warehouse, which contains:
  
• | First party data on over 130 million consumers;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | 224 million unique email addresses;
--+------------------------------------


• | 3.0 billion survey responses and growing by more than 7 million responses a day; and,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | More than 800,000 unique user registrations per day.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 People-based Platform Enabling Deterministic, Omni-channel Marketing—Our collection of holistic information serves as the genesis for our operations and the key foundation to providing actionable consumer data.  Through our data-centric approach to analyzing consumer characteristics and intent, we are capable of producing highly-deterministic advertisements across multiple devices, including desktops, laptops, smartphones and tablets.  By analyzing a consumer’s characteristics and integrating that data into our Agile Audience Engine, we are able to create comprehensive profiles that deliver highly-relevant and targeted advertisements on the most effective medium based on the consumer’s habits.
 Performance Driven Pricing Model that Drives Heightened Return—On—Investment—We recognize performance marketing revenue when the conversions are generated based on predefined user actions such as a click, a registration, an app install or a coupon print. As a result, our revenue is synonymous with customer success, and we only get paid when a user engages with our advertisements. By using a performance-driven pricing model, we enjoy a number of advantages, including increased efficiencies, the ability to exceed ROI projections for customers, and optimized marketing budget allocations limited only on our ability to deliver 
 4


results. Our performance-driven pricing model presents unique opportunities to work within uncapped marketing budgets which in turn create recurring revenue streams from clients who depend on our solutions. Many of our partners view our Performance Marketing solutions as cost of sales and are incentivized to continue utilizing our solutions that directly drive consumer engagement and revenues.
 Predictive Solutions For Complex Advertising Needs—Our proprietary, predictive software algorithm identifies, in real-time, consumers likely to be receptive to our customers’ advertisements, thereby focusing marketing spend on the most efficient and effective channel. Additionally, through targeting and optimization, we provide distinctive solutions that aim to serve the needs of our clients and provide them with the deepest insights possible, in order to make more informed decisions. Through our dynamic surveys, we are able to collect self-reported data from 800,000 consumers every day and learn valuable information that would otherwise be unavailable. This symbiotic relationship allows us to capture extremely timely and meaningful information that ultimately shapes the insights we create. Using this information, we are able to curate custom databases and audience clusters in real-time, layered with additional data from our Information Services segment to create a truly customized and unique dataset for our customers. We aim to fuse self-reported data with transactional public record data, in order to create the most comprehensive view of an individual or business. Our ability to capture as well as integrate data from these two sources allows us to establish a lasting competitive advantage. The marriage of these two complementary data sources in addition to our analytic capabilities is highly unique and differentiated in the market.
Our Platforms and Solutions
 cogint’s CORE and Agile Audience Engine platforms combine the best of both worlds to provide mission-critical information and performance marketing solutions. Our dynamic solutions provide unlimited potential to solve complex problems through customization, vast aggregation of data and ability to ingest any dataset. The marriage of our CORE and Agile Audience Engine platforms allows us to ingest, fuse, and customize datasets of self-reported, transactional and public record data. The exchange and fusion of data and capabilities across industry verticals equally benefit both our Information Services and Performance Marketing segments.

The Company’s operations are organized in two reportable segments: (i) Information Services and (ii) Performance Marketing.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Sales, Distribution and Marketing
 Inside Sales—Our inside sales team cultivates relationships, and ultimately closes business, with their end-user markets. These professionals are relationship-based sellers with experience in identifying clients’ needs and clearly explaining and defining products that provide solutions to those needs.
 Strategic Sales—While the majority of our direct sales efforts are supported through professional inside sales staff, major accounts within certain industries require a more personal, face-to-face sales approach. We continue to expand this team to meet the demand of the markets.
 Distributors, Resellers, and Strategic Partners—In conjunction with direct-to-client sales efforts, we engage value-added distributors, resellers, and strategic partners that have a significant foothold in many of the industries that we have not historically served, as well as to further penetrate those industries that we do serve. This allows us to rapidly penetrate these markets while also significantly reducing overhead associated with direct sales and support efforts.
 Marketing—We have implemented several methods to market our products, including participation in trade shows and seminars, advertising, public relations, distribution of sales literature and product specifications and ongoing communication with prospective clients, distributors, resellers, strategic partners and our installed base of current clients.
Our Strategy
 We are committed to developing unique technology and using our analytical capabilities to deliver solutions that transform the way organizations view data. We are advancing our business through a “three-prong,” strategic approach:

• | The Risk Management Industry—providing actionable intelligence in support of such use cases as the verification and authentication of consumer identities, due diligence, prevention of fraud and abuse, legislative compliance, and debt collection.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Consumer Marketing Industry—deploying advanced data analytics to better identify and segment consumers in support of highly-scalable, people-based marketing, resulting in increased customer acquisition and retention.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Custom Analytics—enabling the public and private sectors to leverage our advanced data fusion platform and analytical applications to obtain insight essential to decision-making processes throughout each client organization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will remain focused on building the business organically and will continue to devote resources to the following to ensure that we are well positioned within the industry.
 Add New Customers and Verticals by Expanding Our Core Data Fusion Technology—We believe that our robust data fusion platform, highly-scalable systems and expansive user database affords us numerous opportunities to leverage our technology into the following areas:
 6


 
• | Paid CRM—leverage our database to accelerate the retargeting of consumers in order to drive greater customer lifetime value (CLV) using paid media such as Google, Facebook, paid search, display and mobile platforms.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Owned CRM—develop a robust strategy and products designed to retarget consumers and drive greater CLV leveraging to company-owned, higher-margin channels including permission-based email marketing, push notifications, text messaging and telephone marketing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data Products—monetize our proprietary data assets outside our own platform by delivering ad targeting and consumer insights solutions (e.g., development of custom audiences for targeting in specific verticals such as finance and insurance).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Market Research—monetize our proprietary survey module by gathering consumer insights for B2C brands and marketing service providers. Surveys can be utilized for internal product strategy development as well as for external thought leadership (white papers, etc.)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Continuous Advancement of Our Technology and Data to Cross-sell and Up-sell—We strongly believe that our ability to continually innovate and invest resources into our technology and data is a key foundation to our success. In addition to improving our predictive software and underlying technology platforms, we also aim to provide new solutions from our data repository in an effort to offer the greatest value to our clients. We believe this allocation of resources will augment our value proposition for both existing and prospective clients. As we invest in our technology platforms and data assets, we will always do so with a view towards providing solutions that deliver scalability, functionality and interoperability. Our technology platforms operate at significant scale and are programmed to functionally deliver reliable and accurate information through our machine learning algorithms whose performance accelerates with each new item of data about a user, creating a perpetual series of network effects. As a result of our ability to process transactional data, self-reported data, and other proprietary datasets at massive scale, we are focused on creating a dynamic platform that maximizes interoperability and continues to drive growth opportunities within our installed customer base.
 Expanding our Sales Team to Enter New International Markets—We intend to continue to grow our existing sales team. Increased sales capability will enable us to work with more direct advertisers, target specific industry verticals, and realize margin upside. Additionally, we believe that a larger sales force provides significant opportunities for us to grow in the U.S. market as well enter and expand operations in new geographic markets, such as Europe and Asia.
 Selective Acquisitions—In addition to organic growth, we may, in the future, make acquisitions of businesses or technologies that advance our objectives and that enhance shareholder value. We are focused on identifying complementary technologies and businesses that advance our “three-prong” strategic approach. The acquisition of Fluent, LLC (“Fluent”) in December 2015 is an example of serving as our entry into the consumer marketing industry while offering a multitude of beneficial synergies. The acquisition provides greater diversity of customers, markets, products, and revenues generated therefrom, within the significantly larger addressable market of the consumer marketing industry. Further, the acquisition presents substantial revenue growth  opportunities within the U.S. through new markets, cross-selling opportunities, the application of our data fusion technology to the consumer marketing industry, the enhancement of existing products and solutions, the development and commercialization of new products and solutions, and the increased aggregation and fusion of consumer data, including our massive first-party consumer database, creating more robust consumer profiles to be utilized for both risk management and consumer marketing, among other uses. While we maintain our long-term strategy of increasing revenue, gaining market share and enhancing shareholder value through internal development and organic growth, we will continually seek to identify and pursue acquisition opportunities that fit within our strategy.
 Grow Direct and Indirect Channels—Ownership of personally identifiable information including valid primary email addresses on over 90% of our consumer database facilitates the deterministic targeting of those consumers across multiple platforms and devices, extending our reach across email, mobile, display, search, social, and eventually addressable television. We intend to grow our owned media properties and increase our partnerships with third-party publishers to further our reach and scale in the market.
Our Competition
 Competition in the big data and analytics sector centers on innovation, product stability, pricing and customer service. The market for our products and services is highly competitive and is subject to constant change. We compete on the basis of differentiated solutions, analytical capabilities, integration with our clients’ technology, client relationships, service stability, innovation and price. We believe we are well-positioned to effectively compete on all fronts.
 In our Information Services segment, our competitors vary widely in size and nature of the products and services they offer. There are a large number of competitors who offer competing products and services in specialized areas, such as fraud prevention, risk management and decisioning solutions. We believe our next-generation data fusion technology, analytical capabilities, robust 
 7


database, and intelligent design of our cloud-based infrastructure will allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competition in flexibility, capability, service and price.
 In our Performance Marketing segment, our traditional competitors have been database marketing services providers, online and traditional media companies, and advertising agencies. We believe the competitive landscape is changing and becoming more complex. We believe our ad-serving and data and customer acquisition technology platform enables our clients to better target, engage, qualify, and communicate with relevant consumers, in a more profitable manner, across mobile, web and in-app content environments than our competitors.
 Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources, better name recognition and a larger customer base. Even if we introduce advanced products that meet evolving customer requirements in a timely manner, there can be no assurance that our new products will gain market acceptance.
 Certain companies in the big data and analytics sector have expanded their product lines or technologies in recent years as a result of acquisitions. Further, more companies have developed products which conform to existing and emerging industry standards and have sought to compete on the basis of price. We anticipate increased competition from large data and analytics vendors. Increased competition in the big data and analytics sector could result in significant price competition, reduced profit margins or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future with current or new competitors.
 Concentration of Customers
 One customer, included in our Performance Marketing segment, accounted for 12% of the Company’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Such customer, however, manages the ad platforms of leading search engines and represents a consortium of advertisers, which limits overall concentration risk.
Our Intellectual Property
 Our success and ability to compete in the market is highly dependent upon our proprietary technology. We rely primarily upon a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as other intellectual property laws, and confidentiality procedures and contractual agreements, such as non-disclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary technology. We recently filed a patent application on our proprietary ad serving and customer acquisition platform and system. We have also entered into various agreements with our suppliers, resellers and certain clients to limit the disclosure of, and access to, sensitive proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the steps taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.
 
We use data acquired through licensing rights from approximately 20 providers. The loss of any one of these providers could have an immediate near-term impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. We rely on declarative, first-party data supplied by our users and supplemented and verified with third-party data sources.
 Regulatory Matters
 Our business is subject to various federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 2721- 2725) (“DPPA”), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 6801- 6809) (“GLBA”),  the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”), the Telephone  Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), and the CAN SPAM Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM  Act”). A change in any one of a number of the laws, rules, or regulations applicable to our business and/or the enactment of future legislation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to provide products or services to its customers.
 Our Performance Marketing segment is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to online advertising, commercial email marketing, telemarketing and privacy, including, but not limited to, the FTC Act, TCPA, Do Not Call Implementation Act, CAN-SPAM Act, Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”) and California Business & Professions Code § 17529 (the “California Anti- Spam Act”). These laws, rules and regulations are constantly changing and keeping our business in compliance with or bringing our business into compliance with new laws may be costly, affect our revenue and harm our financial results.

We believe with change in the Administration and the replacement of the heads of the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), the FTC, and the Consumer Protection Division of the FTC, that the regulatory environment for our business may be more business friendly than previously was the case, though it is certainly too early to gauge the impact with any certainty.
 Seasonality
 Our results are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Historically, certain products within our Information Services segment experience strength during the second and third quarters, while other products, including within our Performance Marketing segment, tend to be strongest in the fourth quarter, due to holiday advertising budgets, which traditionally carry over into the first quarter.
Our Employees
 We employ approximately 200 persons as of December 31, 2016. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization, and none are party to any collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good. Competition in the recruiting of personnel in the big data and analytics sector is intense. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate and retain qualified sales and marketing, executive and administrative and technical personnel. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining qualified employees.
Company Evolution
 Previously, we provided advertising services in the out-of-home advertising industry in China under the name Tiger Media, Inc. (“Tiger Media”). On March 21, 2015, Tiger Media completed the acquisition of The Best One, Inc. (“TBO”). In the transaction, TBO became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tiger Media, with TBO changing its name to IDI Holdings, LLC and Tiger Media changing its name to IDI, Inc. TBO was a holding company engaged in the acquisition of operating businesses and the acquisition and development of technology assets across various industries. Previously, on October 2, 2014, TBO acquired 100% of the membership interests of Interactive Data. Historically, Interactive Data provided data solutions and services to the Accounts Receivable Management industry, consisting primarily of collection agencies, collection law firms, and debt buyers, for location and identity verification, legislative compliance and debt recovery. Interactive Data now serves the entirety of the risk management industry. Through leading-edge, proprietary technology, advanced systems architecture, and a massive data repository, Interactive Data addresses the rapidly growing need for actionable intelligence.
 On December 9, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Fluent with certain transactions effective December 8, 2015. Fluent, founded in 2010, is a leader in people-based digital marketing and customer acquisition, serving over 500 leading consumer brands and direct marketers. Fluent’s proprietary audience data and robust ad-serving technology enables marketers to acquire their best customers, with precision, at a massive scale. Leveraging compelling content, unique first-party data assets, and real-time survey interaction with customers, Fluent has helped marketers acquire millions of new prospective customers since its inception.
 On June 8, 2016, we acquired Q Interactive, LLC (“Q Interactive”), a subsidiary of Selling Source, LLC. Q Interactive was founded in 1994 as Interactive Coupon Marketing Group and provides performance-based digital marketing solutions for advertisers and publishers. We believe the acquisition of Q Interactive is in line with our strategy to bolster our market leadership in performance marketing by adding client relationships as well as technology capabilities.
 On September 14, 2016, we issued a press release announcing a transfer from the NYSE MKT to The NASDAQ Global Market (the “NASDAQ”) on September 26, 2016 under a new symbol “COGT” and rebranding to a new name, Cogint, Inc. We believe a listing on the NASDAQ and rebranding under Cogint, Inc. better reflects our commitment and expertise in driving technology innovations in order to shape the future of the data fusion industry.

 Management Team
 Our management team has a track record of strong performance and significant expertise in the markets we serve. We have built the leading companies in our industry, creating significant shareholder value. We continue to attract and retain experienced management talent for our business. Our team has deep knowledge of the big data and analytics sector and the online marketing and digital advertising industry, and expertise across the various industries that we serve. Our team has overseen the expansion of our proprietary technology platforms, while managing ongoing initiatives and the strategic acquisition of synergistic businesses and technologies. As a result, we are well positioned to continue to successfully drive growth both organically and through acquisitions.
Recent Developments
 On January 18, 2017, the Company’s management and Board of Directors approved the plan to merge and fully integrate Q Interactive’s business into Fluent (the “Integration”), with Q Interactive becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fluent. We expect little or no customer or revenue attrition associated with the Integration. As a result of the cost synergies we will achieve through the Integration, we expect to realize annualized savings in our operating expenses of approximately $4.5 million beginning in the second quarter of 2017. We estimate an aggregate of $0.9 million in restructuring costs associated with the Integration, which we expect to incur in 2017. Also, we estimate an impairment loss on intangible assets of $3.6 million, including primarily trade names and acquired proprietary technology, acquired in the Q Interactive Acquisition, to be recognized in the first quarter of 2017.
 On January 19, 2017, Fluent entered into an Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement ("Amendment No. 3"), amending Fluent's Term Loan facility dated as of December 8, 2015. The Amendment No. 3, among other things, provides for a new term loan in the principal amount of $15.0 million ("Incremental Term Loan"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Amendment No. 3, and modifies certain other provisions set forth in the Credit Agreement, including certain financial covenants and related definitions. The entire Incremental Term Loan was received on February 1, 2017. The Incremental Term Loan and Fluent's existing $45.0 million Term Loan (collectively, the "Term Loans") are guaranteed by the Company and the other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Fluent, in each case, on an equal and ratable basis. The Term Loans accrue interest at the rate of: (a) either, at Fluent's option, LIBOR (subject to a floor of 0.50%) plus 10.5% per annum, or base rate plus 9.5% per annum, payable in cash, plus (b) 1% per annum, payable, at Fluent's option, in either cash or in-kind. Principal amortization of the Term Loans will be $0.7 million per quarter, payable at the end of each calendar quarter, commencing on March 31, 2017. The Term Loans mature on December 8, 2020.
