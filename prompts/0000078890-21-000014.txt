ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
The Brink’s Company is the global leader in total cash management, route-based logistics and payment solutions including cash-in-transit, ATM services, cash management services, including vault outsourcing, money processing, and intelligent safe services, and international transportation of valuables. Our customers include financial institutions, retailers, government agencies (including central banks), mints, jewelers and other commercial operations around the world.  Our global network serves customers in more than 100 countries. We have controlling ownership interests in companies in 52 countries and agency relationships with companies in additional countries.  We employ approximately 76,500 people and our operations include approximately 1,300 facilities and 16,300 vehicles. 
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we implemented changes to our organizational and management structure primarily related to our acquisition of the majority of the cash operations of U.K.-based G4S plc ("G4S") that resulted in changes to our operating segments. Previously, our business was managed and reported in three operating segments: North America, South America and Rest of World. We now mange our business in four segments, and segment results are reported by these four segments. The four segments are as follows: 

•North America – operations in the U.S. and Canada, including the Brink’s Global Services ("BGS") line of business,
•Latin America – operations in Latin American countries where we have an ownership interest, including the BGS line of business. This segment includes operations in Mexico, which was previously reported in the North America segment,
•Europe – operations in European countries that primarily provide services outside of the BGS line of business. This segment includes the BGS line of business within these country operations, and 
•Rest of World – operations in European countries that primarily provide BGS services. This segment includes other lines of business within these country operations. This segment also includes operations in the Middle East, Africa and Asia as well as BGS activity in Latin American countries where we do not have an ownership interest.
Brink’s was founded in 1859 and The Brink’s Company was first incorporated in 1930 under the laws of the State of Delaware (at that time, the Company was named The Pittston Company).  It succeeded to the business of a Virginia corporation in 1986 and was renamed The Brink’s Company in 2003.  Our headquarters are located in Richmond, Virginia.  The Brink’s Company, along with its subsidiaries, is referred to as “we,” “our,”, “us,” “Brink’s,” or “the Company” throughout this Form 10-K.
Mission and Strategy
Our Mission
Introduced in 2019, our mission defines what we want to achieve. It reads:
•Keep the use of cash as easy, secure and affordable as other payment methods for retailers.
•Streamline cash management for financial institutions.
•Provide consumers safe, private and convenient payment options in the digital age.
•Protect, store and transport high-value assets in a changing world. 
Our Strategy
Our strategy has three components: Accelerate Profitable Growth, Close the Gap, and Introduce Differentiated Services.
We will Accelerate Profitable Growth by expanding high-value services, growing revenue and account share with both large and small financial institutions, penetrating unvended retail markets and exploring core and adjacent acquisition opportunities.
We will Close the Gap with operational excellence by exceeding customer expectations, leading our industry in safety and security, and continuing to improve productivity in fleet, money processing and sales. We are on track in our efforts to improve internal productivity, optimize cost and achieve industry-leading margins. 
We will Introduce Differentiated Services by strengthening and leveraging our IT capabilities and operating systems and offering end-to-end cash supply chain managed services. Our IT initiatives will drive improved service levels and operational efficiencies.
To execute our strategy, we manage the business with 3-year plans. Strategic Plan 1 (or SP1) guided us through 2019 and focused on performance and culture. Actions taken in SP1 include internal breakthrough initiatives, such as more efficient vehicles, one-person crews, route optimization, telematics, device monitoring and management, and more effective IT processes leading to lower operating costs. We also completed multiple business acquisitions.
We are currently executing Strategic Plan 2 (or SP2), which goes through 2022 and is designed to expand our role in the cash ecosystem. It focuses on delivering efficiency initiatives, implementing operational excellence and increasing sales of existing services (Strategy 1.0), growing through acquisitions (Strategy 1.5) and creating more value for current and new customers by providing a broader array of high-margin, technology-driven services (Strategy 2.0).
Strategy 2.0 includes the development and implementation of solutions that integrate technology and managed services, such as cloud-based applications, track and trace, customer portals, cash forecasting, and subscription-based pricing, with Brink’s cash-in-transit and money processing services, to deliver complete cash management solutions that are intended to: (1) be competitive with debit and credit payment alternatives and provide retail customers with faster access to working capital, or (2) provide critical device management and managed services that offer financial institutions an attractive outsourcing option.
Services
We design customized services to meet the cash and valuables supply chain needs of our customers.  We enter into contracts with our customers to establish pricing and other terms. Cash-in-transit and ATM contracts usually cover an initial term of at least one year and in many cases one to three years, and generally remain in effect thereafter until canceled by either party.  Contracts for cash management services are typically longer.  Following are descriptions of our service offerings: 
Core Services (52% of total revenues in 2020) 
Cash-in-transit ("CIT") and ATM services are core services we provide to customers throughout the world. We charge customers per service performed or based on the value of goods transported.  Revenues are affected by the level of economic activity in various markets as well as the volume of business for specific customers.  Core services generated approximately $1.9 billion of revenues in 2020 ($2.0 billion in 2019 and $1.7 billion in 2018).
Cash-in-transit services – Serving customers since 1859, our success in CIT is driven by a combination of rigorous security practices, high-quality customer service, risk management and logistics expertise.  Cash-in-transit services generally include the secure transportation of:
•cash between businesses and financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions
•cash, securities and other valuables between commercial banks, central banks and investment banking and brokerage firms
•new currency, coins, bullion and precious metals for central banks and other customers
ATM services – We manage approximately 130,000 ATMs worldwide.  We provide customers who own and operate ATMs a variety of service options.  Basic ATM management services include cash replenishment and first and second line maintenance.  We also provide comprehensive services for ATM management including cash replenishment, replenishment forecasting, cash optimization, ATM remote monitoring, service call dispatching, transaction processing, installation services, and first and second line maintenance. 
High-Value Services (44% of total revenues in 2020)
Our Core Services, combined with our brand and global infrastructure, provide a broad platform from which we offer additional high-value services, which generated approximately $1.6 billion of revenues in 2020 ($1.6 billion in 2019 and $1.6 billion in 2018).
Global services - Brink’s Global Services ("BGS") is the leading global provider of secure transport of highly-valued commodities including diamonds, jewelry, precious metals, securities, banknotes, currency, high-tech devices, electronics and pharmaceuticals.  Our specialized diamond and jewelry operations have offices in the world’s major diamond and jewelry centers. Serving customers in more than 100 countries, BGS provides secure transportation services including pick-up, packaging, customs clearance, secure vault storage and inventory management. BGS uses a combination of armored vehicles and secure air and sea transportation.  
Cash management services - We offer a variety of cash management services, depending on customers’ unique needs. These include:
•money processing (e.g., counting, sorting, wrapping, checking condition of bills, etc.) and other cash management services
•services related to deploying and servicing “intelligent” safes and safe control devices, including our patented CompuSafe®  service
•check imaging services
Other cash management services include cashier balancing, counterfeit detection, account consolidation and electronic reporting.  Retail and bank customers use Brink’s to count and reconcile coins and currency, prepare bank deposit information and replenish coins and currency in specific denominations.
Brink's offers a fully integrated approach to managing customers' supply chain of cash.  These services include logistical support from point-of-sale through transport, vaulting, bank deposit and related credit reporting.  We also offer a variety of technology applications including online cash tracking, cash inventory management, check imaging for real-time deposit processing, and a variety of other web-based tools that enable banks and other customers to reduce costs while improving service to their customers. We believe the quality and scope of our money processing and information systems differentiate our cash management services from competitive offerings.
Brink’s CompuSafe® service –We manage approximately 49,900 installed Compusafe devices worldwide. Brink’s CompuSafe service provides an integrated, closed-loop system for minimizing theft and managing cash.  We market CompuSafe services to a variety of cash-intensive customers including convenience stores, gas stations, restaurants, retail chains and entertainment venues.  In a majority of instances, once the specialized safe is installed, the customer’s employees deposit currency into the safe’s cassettes, which can only be removed by Brink’s personnel or in some instances, securely by customer employees.  Upon removal, the cassettes are securely transported to a vault for processing where contents are verified and transferred for deposit.  Our CompuSafe service features currency-recognition and counterfeit-detection technology, multi-language touch screens and in some instances, an electronic interface between the point-of-sale, back-office systems and external banks.  Our electronic reporting interface with external banks enables customers to receive same-day credit on their cash balances, even if the cash remains on the customer’s premises. 
Vaulting services.  Vaulting services combine cash-in-transit services, cash management services, vaulting and electronic reporting technologies to help banks expand into new markets while minimizing investment in vaults and branch facilities.  In addition to providing secure storage, we process deposits, provide check imaging and reconciliation services, perform currency inventory management, process ATM replenishment orders and electronically transmit banking transactions.
Payment services – We provide convenient payment services, including bill payment and collection services, and Brink’s Money™ prepaid cards and corporate debit cards. 
Bill payment and collection services include bill payment acceptance and processing services on behalf of utility companies and other billers. Consumers can pay bills and manage accounts at retail agent locations that we operate on behalf of utility companies, banks and a small number of leased payment locations. This service is offered at over 8,500 locations in Brazil, Colombia, Panama and Mexico.
We offer Brink’s Money™ general purpose reloadable prepaid cards and corporate debit cards to consumers, employers and small and medium size businesses in the U.S. Our general purpose reloadable cards are sold to consumers through our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts, and our payroll cards are sold to employers who use them to pay employees electronically, while our business expense cards are sold to small businesses that set controls on employee spending. Brink’s Money™ cards can be used at stores, restaurants, online retailers, and at ATMs worldwide. These products are targeted toward the millions of unbanked and under-banked Americans and small businesses looking for alternative financial products.  
Other Security Services (4% of total revenues in 2020)
Guarding – We protect airports, offices, warehouses, stores, and public venues with or without electronic surveillance, access control, fire prevention and trained patrolling personnel. Other security services generated approximately $0.2 billion of revenues in 2020 ($0.1 billion in 2019 and $0.2 billion in 2018).
We offer security and guarding services in Luxembourg, Greece and Brazil.  A portion of this business involves long-term contracts related primarily to security services at airports and embassies.  Generally, guarding contracts are for a one-year period, and the majority of contracts are extended.
Commercial security systems – We provide commercial security system services in designated markets in Europe.  Our security system design and installation services include alarms, motion detectors, closed-circuit televisions, digital video recorders, and access control systems, including card and biometric readers, electronic locks, and turnstiles.  We may also provide monitoring services after systems have been installed.
Industry and Competition
Brink’s competes with large multinational, regional and smaller companies throughout the world.  Our largest multinational competitors are Loomis AB (Sweden); Prosegur, Compania de Seguridad, S.A. (Spain); and Garda World Security Corporation (Canada).
We believe the primary factors in attracting and retaining customers are security expertise, service quality, and price.  Our competitive advantages include:
•brand name recognition
•reputation for a high level of service and security
•risk management and logistics expertise
•global network and customer base
•proven operational excellence, and
•high-quality insurance coverage and financial strength
Although we face competitive pricing pressure in many markets, we resist competing on price alone.  We believe our high levels of service, security expertise and value-added solutions differentiate us from competitors.
Seasonality
Our revenues and earnings are typically higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to generally increased activity associated with the holiday season.
Insurance Coverage
The availability of high-quality and reliable insurance coverage is an important factor in our ability to attract and retain customers and manage the risks inherent in our business.  We purchase insurance coverage for losses in excess of what we consider to be prudent levels of self-insurance.  Our insurance policies cover losses from most causes, with the exception of war, nuclear risk and certain other exclusions typical in such policies.
Insurance for security is provided by different groups of underwriters at negotiated rates and terms.  Premiums fluctuate depending on market conditions.  The security loss experience of Brink’s and, to a limited extent, other armored carriers affects our premium rates.
Service Mark and Patents
BRINKS is a registered service mark in the U.S. and certain foreign countries.  The BRINKS mark, name and related marks are of material significance to our business.  We own patents for safes and related services, iDeposit and Daily Credit processes, including our integrated CompuSafe® service, which expire between 2022 and 2033.  These patents provide us with important advantages. However, we are not dependent on the existence of these patents.
We have licensed the Brink’s name to a limited number of companies, including a company that provides residential smart home and home security services and a distributor of security products (padlocks, door hardware, etc.) to customers through major retail chains. 
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental agencies. Various federal, state and local agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate regulate certain aspects of our business, including safety of operations, equipment and financial responsibility. Movement of valuable shipments are generally subject to import/export regulations. We are also subject to certain firearm regulations in connection with our armored logistics operations. We must comply with licensing, permits and registration requirements imposed by various federal, state and local governmental agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Our permits and licensing requirements vary by jurisdictions based on the scope of business conducted and applicable laws and regulations.
Human Capital Management 
Culture and Values
At Brink’s, the following values underpin our company culture: Safety, Integrity, Engagement, Continuous Improvement, Customer Focus, and, our newest value, Diversity and Inclusion. Our values guide the way we work and are the cornerstone of our winning culture. They ensure that we work safely to protect ourselves and others, consider the customer first in all we do, display the highest standards of ethics, engage and empower employees, continually find new ways to improve the way we work, and foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. 
Workforce Demographics 
We have a culturally and geographically diverse workforce that serves customers in more than 100 countries. Based upon business demand, we have a need for a flexible workforce. In certain geographic regions, statutory employee protections may limit our ability to increase or decrease our workforce without significant expense.
At December 31, 2020, our company had approximately 73,700 full-time and 2,800 part-time employees. Approximately 86% of our employees, approximately 65,500, are outside the United States. Of our approximately 11,000 employees in the United States, approximately 700 were classified as part-time employees. Certain employees in the United States provide corporate services throughout the various regions in which we operate. 
A part of our second three-year Strategic Plan, or SP2, includes strategic acquisitions. We previously announced the acquisition of the majority of the cash operations of G4S. As of December 31, 2020, we had completed substantially all of this transaction, including acquiring a number of employees, which at year-end remained at approximately 18,700 employees. These employees consist of full time and contract employees. In general, these employees were added to our local compensation and benefit programs, except where existing contractual and statutory obligations required continuation of other programs. All management employees have successfully completed an induction program to ensure that they are aligned with the Company’s compensation, performance management, talent management and compliance policies.
Employee Safety and Wellness
Employee safety is of paramount importance as we strive to bring every employee home safe every night. During 2020, we shifted Company priorities to adapt to the immediate needs of the COVID-19 pandemic by, among other things, prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, their families and our customers, while maintaining our essential services to our customers. This included investing in additional personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning protocols, and work protocols aimed at minimizing unnecessary social contact both in our workplaces and while serving our customers. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
With the significant focus on racial injustice in the U.S., and the ripple effects around the world in 2020, we reflected on how best to demonstrate and reinforce our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) to our employees and stakeholders. With input from our Board and internal and external stakeholders, we increased the emphasis on DE&I in our Values, which underpin all that we stand for and guide how we work together. We hired our first DE&I leader and welcomed him in early 2021 to continue to evolve our DE&I strategy, define our goals, evaluate our progress, and guide our communications. In 2020, we joined the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, an organization that works to advance diversity and inclusion in the workplace. We continued to expand the scope and programs of our Women’s Leadership Forum, established in 2018 to promote women’s leadership in the Company’s U.S., Canada and Mexico businesses. We established UNITY as a new Business Resource Group for Black employees in the U.S. Our Business Resource Groups are supported with an executive sponsor, and we are thoughtfully considering expanding them in both scope and reach in the future.
In early 2021, we signed the UN Global Compact, affirming our commitment to meet fundamental responsibilities in the areas of human rights, labor and the environment. More information on our Environmental, Social and Governance Priorities can be found on our Sustainability page on our brinks.com website.

We have no union employees in the U.S. At December 31, 2020, Brink’s was a party to nine collective bargaining agreements in Canada with various local unions covering approximately 1,300 employees. The agreements have various expiration dates from 2021 to 2024. 
Outside of North America, approximately 53% of our employees are represented by trade union organizations and/or covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
Latin America – At December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 31,500 employees, 71% of whom are covered by various collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates from 2021-2023.

We believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
Business Divestitures
Below is a summary of the significant businesses we exited in the last three years.  These divestitures did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. Operating results for these businesses are included in continuing operations for all periods presented, as applicable. We continue to operate our global services business in each of these countries.
•In the first quarter of 2020, we sold 100% of our ownership interest in a French security services company.
•In the second quarter of 2019, we exited a top-up prepaid mobile phone business in Brazil.
•In the second quarter of 2018, we sold 100% of our ownership interest in a French airport security services company.
Business Acquisitions
On February 26, 2020, we announced that we agreed to acquire the majority of the cash management operations of G4S, with closings planned in multiple phases in 2020. In March 2020, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of G4S International Logistics Group Limited, a company that directly or indirectly owns controlling interests in multiple businesses providing secure international transportation of valuables. In the second quarter of 2020, we acquired cash management operations from G4S located in the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, Hong Kong, Cyprus, Romania, the Czech Republic, Malaysia, the Dominican Republic and the Philippines. In the third quarter of 2020, we acquired operations in Indonesia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. For the majority of the acquisitions in the second and third quarters of 2020, we acquired 100% of the ownership interests. In Malaysia, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines and Indonesia, we acquired ownership interests of less than 100%. We believe that we meet the accounting criteria for consolidating these subsidiaries. In the aggregate, the purchase consideration for the G4S acquisitions in 2020 is $709.7 million. The operations we have acquired in 2020, which represent approximately 90% of the total estimated purchase price, generate approximately $740 million in annual revenues.
In January 2019, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Rodoban Transportes Aereos e Terrestres Ltda., Rodoban Servicos e Sistemas de Seguranca Ltda., and Rodoban Seguranca e Transporte de Valores Ltda. (together "Rodoban") for $134 million. Rodoban provides CIT, money processing and ATM services primarily in southeastern Brazil. Also in 2019, we acquired three business operations in three countries for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50 million. Below is a brief description of each of these additional three business acquisitions completed in 2019:
•In June 2019, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Balance Innovations, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary, Balance Innovations Services, Inc. (together "BI"). BI develops and licenses software that provides real-time data to optimize operations for general retail and convenience store industries throughout the United States and Canada. 
•In June 2019, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Comercio Eletronico Facil Ltda. ("COMEF"), a Brazil-based company. COMEF offers bank correspondent services and bill payment processing to consumers.
•In September 2019, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Transportadora de Valores del Sur Limitada and its wholly owned subsidiary, TVS Pagos, Recaudos y Procesos S.A.S. (together "TVS"). TVS provides CIT and money processing services in Colombia. 
In August 2018, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Dunbar Armored, Inc. ("Dunbar") for approximately $541 million. Dunbar is a U.S. cash management business. In December 2018, we acquired 60% of the shares of Worldbridge Secure Logistics Co., Ltd. ("Worldbridge"), a Cambodian company that provides CIT and money processing services. 
See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on the acquired assets and liabilities from these acquisitions.
In November 2018, we completed the acquisition of the 42% noncontrolling interest in our consolidated subsidiary, Brink's de Colombia, S.A. We now own 100% of the shares of this subsidiary, and we accounted for this increase in ownership interest as an equity transaction. 
Reorganization and Restructuring
In the fourth quarter of 2016, management implemented restructuring actions across our global business operations and our corporate functions (“2016 Reorganization and Restructuring”). As a result of these actions, we recognized $18.1 million in related 2016 costs and an additional $17.3 million in 2017 under this restructuring related to severance, asset-related adjustments, a benefit program termination and lease terminations. We recognized an additional $13.0 million of costs in 2018 under this restructuring for severance and asset-related adjustments. The actions under the 2016 Reorganization and Restructuring were substantially completed in 2018, with cumulative pretax charges of approximately $48 million. Severance actions from this restructuring reduced our global workforce by approximately 800 positions. 
Other Restructurings 
Management periodically implements restructuring actions in targeted sections of our business. As a result of these actions, we recognized net costs of $7.6 million in 2018 and $28.8 million in 2019, primarily severance costs and charges related to the modification of share-based compensation awards in 2019. We recognized $66.6 million net costs in operating profit and $0.6 million costs in interest and other nonoperating income (expense) in 2020, primarily severance costs. For the current restructuring actions, we expect to incur additional costs between $4 million and $6 million in future periods.
