Corporate History and Background
 
On December 21, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), Pivotal Investment Corporation II, a special purpose acquisition company incorporated on March 20, 2019 (“Pivotal”), consummated a business combination pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of September 17, 2020 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Pivotal, PIC II Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Pivotal (“Merger Sub”), and XL Hybrids, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Legacy XL”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, a business combination between Pivotal and Legacy XL was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Legacy XL, with Legacy XL surviving as the surviving company and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pivotal (the “Merger” and, collectively with the other transactions described in the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”). On the Closing Date, and in connection with the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), Pivotal Investment Corporation II changed its name to XL Fleet Corp.
Company Overview 
 
We are a leading provider of fleet electrification solutions for commercial vehicles in North America, with over 4,300 electrified powertrain systems sold and driven over 140 million miles by over 200 fleets as of December 31, 2020. Our vision is to become the world leader in fleet electrification solutions, with a mission of accelerating the adoption of fleet electrification systems through cost effective, customer tailored and comprehensive solutions.
 
In over 10 years of operations, we have built one of the largest end-use commercial fleet customer bases of any Class 2-6 vehicle electrification company in North America. Our fleet electrification solutions for commercial vehicles provide the market with cost-effective hybrid and plug-in hybrid solutions with on-board telematics that are widely available for sale and deployment across a broad range of popular vehicle chassis from the world’s leading original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). We believe we are positioned to capitalize on our market leadership as we expand our product offering into additional propulsion technologies including full battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell systems, heavier vehicles such as Class 7-8 vehicles, additional vehicles models in Class 2-6 and comprehensive vehicle charging and energy solutions. We currently sell most of our systems through a network of commercial vehicle upfitters, which we estimate already produces over 100,000 commercial vehicles a year.
 
Our current electrified drive systems are comprised of an electric motor that is mounted onto the vehicle’s drive shaft, an inverter motor controller, and a lithium-ion battery pack to store energy to be used for propulsion. We deploy our electrified drive systems (“XLH™” and “XLP™”) onto the chassis of vans, pickups, shuttle buses, delivery trucks, and many other commercial vehicles produced by OEMs such as Ford, GMC, Chevrolet and Isuzu. This technology can be installed as the vehicles are being manufactured by industry standard second stage manufacturers known as upfitters in less than one day, with no negative impact on the vehicles’ operational performance, maintenance schedules or factory warranties. Our electrified powertrain systems capture and store energy during regenerative braking and subsequently deploy that energy into the driveline during acceleration, operating in parallel with the existing OEM drive train. In addition, our plug-in hybrid system offers the ability to supplement this energy via a connection with an AC electricity source, including a level 1 or level 2 charger. Our systems enable vehicles to burn less fuel and emit less carbon dioxide (“CO2”), resulting in increases of up to a 25-50% miles per gallon (“MPG”) improvement and up to a 20-33% reduction in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. To date, vehicles deploying our electrification solutions have driven over 150 million miles.
 
We are making fleet electrification affordable, accessible, and easy-to-adopt for end-use customers. Our current drive systems enable commercial vehicle fleet operators to make immediate progress toward sustainability goals while the industry moves toward sustainable drive system vehicles that are available, affordable and viable for commercial applications.
 
We are developing additional offerings to extend our range of electrification options with plans to include full battery electric propulsion (“XL ELECTRIC™”) and, hydrogen fuel cell electric systems. We further intend to deliver our systems on a broader range of vehicle applications (including Class 8 products and electrified refuse vehicles, among other applications). In addition, we plan to offer comprehensive charging solutions (“XL GRID™”) and Electrification-as-a-Service (“EaaS”), which would finance and manage vehicles, powertrains, charging systems, on-site power and energy storage systems while charging customers on a usage and time basis.
 
Class 2-6 includes vehicles generally classified as light duty (less than 10,000 pounds) and medium duty (between 10,000 pounds and 60,000 pounds) under the gross vehicle weight rating system. Historically, Class 2-6 has consisted of 600,000 to 650,000 new vehicles manufactured and sold in North America each year and Class 7-8 has ranged from 150,000 to 375,000 new vehicles per year.

In the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced significant COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions. Despite these disruptions, we had significant fleet sales volume in the second half of 2020, with over 80% of our revenues realized in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020. We believe that revenue for 2021 will also be heavily weighted to the back half of the year. Many of these COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions have continued into fiscal year 2021, with delays in government responses at the Federal, state, municipal and local levels and postponements of purchases of our products by municipal and other departments due to major budget shortfalls. In addition, we believe that the impact of the global microchip shortage that the entire vehicle industry is currently experiencing will adversely impact our operating results in fiscal year 2021. Given these uncertainties and uncertainty related to vaccination speed and rates and potential impacts of new variants of COVID-19, we believe there continues to be pandemic related risks to our business and our results of operations. 
 
Market Opportunity
 
We estimate that the total addressable market for our products and services is over $1 trillion, when considering the current global market for commercial vehicles, fuel consumption, charging equipment and other operating expenses. We intend to offer a wide array of electrified drive systems including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, pure-electric and hydrogen fuel-cell electric systems to cover the full range of Class 2-8 commercial vehicles; and are expanding into the EaaS market, which includes leveraging our cloud-based data and strong industry relationships to offer a comprehensive, all-in-one solution that includes electrified vehicles, charging infrastructure and data-based fleet management and energy services.
 
There are estimated to be over 29 million commercial trucks in use in the U.S. alone, with roughly one million new commercial vehicles sold each year in North America (aside from the below normal market conditions driven by COVID-19). While commercial trucks serve a wide range of critical business and societal functions, the vast majority are powered by gasoline and diesel fuel. Transportation is now the leading source of GHG emissions in the U.S., and many fleets are motivated (and increasingly mandated) to curb those emissions in their daily operations.
 
In their attempts to curb emissions, commercial and municipal fleets are increasingly adopting electrification as their alternative propulsion technology of choice. Demand for these vehicles has increased significantly in recent years, at the same time, broad adoption of electric vehicles is unlikely to occur for a number of years in the fleet market, due to challenges including, but not limited to, the extreme drive cycle and energy requirements of larger fleet vehicles, the high capital cost of battery electric vehicles , the lack of available charging infrastructure to power the vehicles for frequent use cycles, and the dearth of commercially viable electric vehicles available for purchase which meet the operating requirements of fleets. We believe all electric solutions will make sense for certain segments of the commercial fleet market and intend to develop all electric solutions for appropriate market segments.
 
We have built one of the largest end-use commercial fleet customer bases of any Class 2-6 vehicle electrification company in North America. Our fleet electrification solutions provide the market with cost-effective, affordable hybrid and plug-in hybrid solutions with on-board telematics that are widely available for sale and deployment across a broad range of popular vehicle chassis from the world’s leading OEMs. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on our market leadership as we expand our product offering into additional propulsion technologies including full battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell systems, heavier vehicles such as Class 7-8 vehicles, additional vehicles models in Class 2-6 and comprehensive vehicle charging and energy solutions.
 
We believe that the opportunity for expansion is even greater outside North America, particularly throughout Europe and Asia, which are adopting electrified vehicles and deploying charging infrastructure more aggressively than in the Americas. These continents have also historically been more progressive in incentivizing and mandating CO2 emissions reductions, further accelerating the demand for these vehicles. As we expand our operations, we intend to capitalize on the increasing global market demand. We are exploring specific opportunities for international sales in Asia, Europe, and South America and intend to commence sales in one or more of these regions by the end of 2022. Our management team has past experience selling hybrid systems in Asia, Europe and South America and we intend to grow our organizational capability further to facilitate international expansion. At this point in time, we have not yet determined a specific timeline for expansion in any particular international market.
 
Our Technology and Products
 
Since our founding, we have developed an extensive technology library and know-how that has enabled us to create proprietary commercial fleet electrification solutions which are reliable and cost effective. We have been producing and shipping our hybrid electric drive systems to customers since 2012, and we have deployed thousands of units for hundreds of fleets over that time period. In 2017, we introduced our plug-in hybrid electric drive system, which offers a more significant MPG and emissions improvement than the hybrid system, while enabling customers to plug in their vehicles to a level 1 or level 2 charging station. Combined, as of December 31, 2020, vehicles deploying our electrification solutions have driven over 140 million total miles while realizing significant gains in MPG and substantial reductions in CO2 emissions.
 
Our hybrid or plug-in hybrid system is installed onto a traditional factory OEM chassis as it is manufactured at the industry standard second stage manufacturer and transforms that vehicle into a more fuel-efficient hybrid/plug-in hybrid unit. This is accomplished by adding an electric motor, an advanced lithium-ion battery pack, and control software. No other significant modifications to the vehicle are required, and no changes are made to the internal combustion engine or transmission.

Our hybrid systems (branded as “XLH™”) have been proven to improve MPG by up to 25% over standard gas-powered vehicles, while reducing CO2 emissions by up to 20%. Our plug-in hybrid system, branded as “XL Plug-In™” or “XLP™”, was named one of TIME magazine’s The 100 Best Inventions of 2019. The XLP offers an even more significant improvement in these metrics, demonstrating up to a 50% MPG improvement and up to a 33% reduction in emissions.
 
Both systems allow the vehicle to continue leveraging its internal combustion engine, while an electric motor mounted on the driveshaft provides an electric assist during acceleration that reduces strain on the engine and lowers the amount of gas consumed. During deceleration, that motor serves as a generator that captures energy through a process called regenerative braking, which stores that energy in the system’s battery pack. When the vehicle accelerates, that power is transferred into the driveline once again, and the process repeats. This allows our systems to operate in parallel with the OEM drivetrain, maintain factory vehicle warranties, and regenerate energy automatically to help power the vehicle.
 
Both the XLH and XLP system feature certain standard individual components, although the specific specifications and mounting locations differ depending on the vehicle chassis and electrification system used. Our systems are custom designed, with components configured and mounted uniquely for each compatible vehicle on which we operate. While an XL system includes over 100 different parts in its bill of materials, the four major components are illustrated and summarized below.
 



1) | Electric traction motor. The electric motor mounts onto the vehicle’s driveshaft, which has been modified to accommodate this component. During deceleration, it leverages regenerative braking to capture energy normally wasted in braking and help slow the vehicle, reducing wear on the brakes. During acceleration, it uses the recaptured energy to provide up to an additional 220 ft./lbs. of torque into the driveline, reducing the load on the engine and thereby reducing fuel consumption. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Motor drive. This inverter controls and conditions the back and forth flow of power to and from the battery pack, depending on whether the system is expelling energy (during acceleration) or capturing energy (during deceleration). 
3) | Control Module and Data Analytics Platform. We install a control module and telematics unit (which is branded as “XL Link”). The control module is the “brains” of the electric powertrain and determines how to operate the powertrain based on driver demands and vehicle and powertrain conditions. The telematics unit enables remote commissioning, remote software updates, remote service assessments, and transmits data to a proprietary cloud-based software system which can analyze various vehicle and systems metrics. The XL Link platform also provides a useful tool for research and development (“R&D”) and we intend to expand this tool to facilitate fleet electrification planning (vehicle/powertrain selection and charging infrastructure planning).
4) | Battery pack. Both the XLH and XLP systems feature a lithium ion battery pack of varying capacities (depending on whether it is a hybrid or plug-in hybrid system). This battery pack can be mounted under the chassis or in the bed of a pickup truck depending on the system design and the configuration of the chassis on which it is mounted. 

 In the future, we intend to leverage our strong OEM and upfitter partnerships, internal engineering expertise and broad customer base to bring new electrification solutions to market. These include a wider array of available chassis options, deeper relationships with current and future OEM partners, and an expansion of our electrification suite to include electric vehicles (“EV”) and potentially hydrogen fuel cell enabled systems. We expect to develop proof-of-concept prototypes of these new systems in 2021 and introduce such systems for sale between late 2021 and late 2022.
 
We plan to offer charging and power management solutions. Such solutions are expected to include charging stations, onsite energy storage and power generation as well as system management. This offering will be branded as XL GRID, and we expect to work with a range of partners to provide a consolidated and comprehensive offering. We formally launched XL GRID in December 2020.
 
Further, we have a unique opportunity to leverage our hardware, software and energy industry partnerships to potentially launch an EaaS offering. Such an offering bundles vehicles, xEV powertrains, charging infrastructure, power and energy supply and other services for customers to provide an easy and low risk transition to fleet electrification and emissions reductions. Such an offering has the potential to increase our product sales and leverage the data in XL Link. We expect that this offering will also create pools of fleet electrification assets which are attractive to infrastructure and other investors, especially those with sustainability targets and focus. We anticipate to offer EaaS to select customers beginning in 2021.

Industry and Competition
 
When we were founded in 2009, the commercial vehicle electrification market was in the early stages and featured limited competition. In recent years, however, the vehicle electrification market has significantly expanded. In the consumer (non-commercial) market, companies such as Tesla have helped push electrification for passenger vehicles to the forefront, and many other startups have entered the space to capitalize on the increased interest. Nearly all traditional OEMs have accelerated and expanded their own electric vehicle lineups.
 
While we expect the trend toward increased competition to continue, our management believes we are well-positioned to compete favorably. Unlike the majority of companies in the vehicle electrification industry, which produce light duty passenger vehicles targeted for the consumer (non-commercial) market, we have historically focused exclusively on the commercial market. In the commercial space, vehicles are heavily customized with bodies that are built to suit the application for which they are purchased. We have established relationships with a large network of companies that perform this work who are certified to sell, install and service our electrification systems. We credit this go to market strategy for our recent growth and ability to remain customer-focused and responsive to market demand for our products. As a result, we believe that we have built the largest and broadest commercial fleet customer base for Class 2-6 hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in North America.
 
There are few companies that we consider to be direct competitors. Companies such as Workhorse operate in the Class 2-6 market and others like Lordstown Motors Corp. (“Lordstown”) are focused on bringing Class 2 EVs to market. As we expand into the Class 7 and 8 markets, we will face new competitors, such as Hyliion, Inc. (“Hyliion”), which are focused on the Class 8/heavy truck market.
 
Several new and established OEMs are currently building battery electric, or all electric, vehicles for the commercial market, but our management believes that these OEMs are likely to focus where there is the most crossover with the consumer market (primarily small pickup trucks and vans). Throughout our history, we have worked closely with traditional OEMs such as Ford, GM and Isuzu to provide electrification solutions for their standard gas-powered vehicles, so we consider our relationship to such companies to be that of a market partner as opposed to a competitor. However, with the continued interest being shown in EVs, we may experience competition from OEMs that release all electric versions of the same vehicles being deployed with our systems. We expect to continue to produce hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions of those vehicles due to the operational advantages and customer preferences those products offer. We further expect to expand our product line into the larger medium and heavy duty EV applications.
 
As we expand our product line to include EV applications, as well as Class 7-8 vehicle types, we will potentially begin competing with several other current and future EV developers who are looking to serve those markets. This could include current manufacturers such as Lion Electric Company, Hyliion, Green Power Motor Company, Nikola Motor Company and Proterra, Inc. If we expand into a full EaaS suite, in which we could offer bundled packages of vehicles, charging infrastructure, energy and fleet management consulting on an as-needed basis, we would also begin competing with several other companies who are considering entering the emerging EaaS space such as Nikola and their “bundled pricing”.
 
Customers 
 
In our 10-year existence, we have served over 200 end-use customers deploying over 4,300 systems. These systems have combined use in real world applications in excess of 140 million miles as of December 31, 2020. Our end-use customers most often purchase our systems from upfitters, OEM dealerships or other participants in our sales channels, who are our direct customers. Our end-use customer base is comprised of Fortune 500 corporate enterprises, public utilities, and municipalities of all sizes, a group that we estimate to operate over one million vehicles globally. We continue to develop these relationships with new products while growing the base with new customers seeking sustainability options in the Class 2-6 commercial vehicle market. We expect to continue to develop opportunities that lead to additional product offerings into the Class 7-8 commercial vehicle market.
 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we had one customer that accounted for over 10% of our revenue. Sales to Farmbro Inc., an upfitter, accounted for 68% of our total revenue in fiscal 2020. Our customer concentration has historically varied based on the receipt of large fleet orders, a trend that we expect to continue in the near term.
 
We expect 2021 to follow typical customer seasonal purchasing patterns, with a majority of our revenue coming in the third and fourth quarters of the year. More than 80% of our sales were recognized in the second half of 2020, and we’d expect a similar or even more pronounced concentration of revenue in 2021.
 
Our customers typically purchase commercial vehicles with a 3 to 6 month lead time. All our orders are designed to meet a specified OEM vehicle chassis (VIN level), with production and shipment coordinated to meet simultaneously via the industry standard ship-thru process. Our systems are sourced and built to exacting specifications in line with OEM production timelines and customer installation preferences, and supply is sourced to meet these timelines. Our sales and marketing team uses a software tool to track all sales opportunities to existing and potential customers, identifying specific vehicles and our systems for such vehicles. This is used by our management to create projections about future aggregate sales pipeline opportunities for our existing products. Our management reviews our sales opportunity pipeline data and applies our historic conversion rates of sales pipeline and historical experience with respect to lead time to create revenue projections. Our management believes that our revenue estimates and committed backlog are important indicators of expected future performance.

Partnerships and Suppliers
 
Sales Upfit Channel Partnerships
 
We rely on an established upfitter partner network with locations throughout the U.S. and Canada to support the installation of our product via the industry standard ship-thru and upfit processes. Our upfitter partners are trained by our staff to use our Installation Process Platform and are certified to install our full line of products. Training is supported by our online step-by-step instruction manual for each kit, along with remote commissioning designed to ensure a successful installation and customer satisfaction. These same partners are also authorized to act as resellers of our full product line to their respective customers using their own sales organizations.
Sales FMC Channel Partnerships
 
We market our systems in conjunction with several major fleet management companies (“FMCs”) in North America and partner with their sales, consulting, and vehicle engineering teams to support customer demand. This channel allows us to expand our reach to over two million leased vehicles with our portfolios.
OEM Channel Partnerships
 
We collaborate with vehicle manufacturers to design, build, and deliver our systems in targeted fleet applications. We anticipate that this segment will continue to grow as the larger vehicle OEMs focus on electrification solutions based on consumer demand.
Production/Supply Chain Partnerships
 
We rely on third-party suppliers for the provision and development of many of the key components and materials used in our electrified powertrain solutions. While we obtain components from multiple, redundant suppliers whenever possible, some of the components used in our vehicles are purchased from a single source or a limited number of sources. We are reliant upon a single source, Parker Hannifin Corporation, for the supply of motor components operating under a three-year non-exclusive supply agreement with volume and pricing commitments.
 
In the first half of 2020 as result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced multiple supply and service disruptions impacting our hybrid electric vehicle (“HEV”) product line. Our primary battery test facility halted testing of our HEV battery, preventing the validation of a newly designed battery. After several weeks, we were able to find an alternate test facility to restart the battery validation. This required sourcing, contracts, test plan development, training, and movement of essential hardware and equipment from the original location in New York to California resulting in a several month delay. Both test facility service providers are procured under a purchase order service arrangement.
 
Further, a battery supply partner, operating under a multi-year non-exclusive supply agreement with volume and pricing commitments, had significant supply disruptions in the April-May timeframe due to sub-supplier impacts on the Indiana and Michigan labor forces. In addition, a supplier with whom we procure battery components under a month-to-month purchase order, had battery supply disruptions with a temporary closure of a manufacturing plant in Michigan. This closure impacted the supply of HEV batteries to us by several weeks.

Strategy
 
As a leading provider of hybrid and plug-in hybrid electrification systems for Class 2-6 commercial fleet vehicles, and with more than 140 million customer miles driven on our electrification systems as of December 31, 2020, we believe that we are in a unique position to expand our product offering and capitalize on the increasing demand for vehicle electrification. We are one of only a few companies that have deployed thousands of xEV powertrains in the Class 2-6 commercial fleet market in the U.S. and Canada, so we have established significant experience, data and relationships enabling scalable production, supply chain and service compared to competitors with relatively few systems in operation. We also have established global customers and suppliers. Our objective is to be a world leader in fleet electrification solutions, and our mission is to accelerate the adoption of fleet electrification systems through cost effective, customer tailored and comprehensive solutions. We have developed a strategy for delivering additional value and expanding market share moving forward, with plans to:

● | Expand our xEV platform to include battery electric options. We believe that our customer base is among the early adopters of commercial electrification, and that many customers are currently or may soon be interested in expanding into all-electric options. Our position in the hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric market has enabled the development of strong relationships with existing customers and prospective customers, who may be prime candidates for adopting all electric versions of our systems in the future. Furthermore, we believe that we have the potential to become the first major commercial fleet electrification provider to include a full suite of commercial xEV offerings (hybrid, plug-in hybrid, battery electric) in our offerings. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expand offerings into new vehicle classes (7-8), chassis configurations and applications. We are a leading provider of electrification systems for Class 2-6 commercial vehicles, with applications available for pickup trucks, cargo/passenger vans, buses, box trucks, step vans, ambulances, stripped chassis and more. By expanding our lineup into Class 7 and 8 vehicles, we plan to add more medium- and heavy-duty options to our lineup, for applications such as refuse vehicles, city transit buses, tractor trailers, bucket trucks and more. We believe that this expansion has the potential to create opportunities within a new market segment historically consisting of hundreds of thousands of vehicles sold each year in North America alone. 
● | Expand offerings to include comprehensive charging solutions and power management through an offering branded as XL GRID™. We have hundreds of fleet customers, which, in the aggregate, operate thousands of facilities across the U.S. and Canada. Most of these facilities do not have sufficient vehicle charging infrastructure, and we expect to leverage our customer relationships and fleet operational data to effectively deploy and manage charging systems. These facilities typically have dozens and, in some cases, even hundreds of vehicles onsite, such that integrating charging with the existing building power system can create challenges. We expect to offer onsite power and energy storage solutions to customers to help manage these challenges. We also expect to offer services to help manage vehicle charging in order to reduce costs and increase the value of the fleet vehicle charging. We may work with partners to offer certain aspects of this comprehensive offering.
● | Grow business globally to capitalize on worldwide demand for vehicle electrification. Global markets, particularly Europe, Asia and India, are also adopting vehicle electrification. By growing our commercial reach into these markets, we believe that we can build significant share and revenue opportunities within an untapped community of customers. We currently work with many fleets in the U.S. and Canada that operate vehicles globally, providing an opportunity to quickly expand worldwide within those fleets. 
● | Build upon an established leadership position in fleet electrification as well as energy industry and infrastructure finance relationships to establish a fleet EaaS offering. With our established and expanding product line of xEV solutions (“XLH™”, “XLP™” and “XL ELECTRIC™”), a robust fleet electrification analytics platform (“XL Link”), and our future offering of comprehensive charging and power solutions (“XL GRID™”). We believe we are well positioned to offer fleet EaaS. In this offering, we aim to aggregate and package vehicles, electric powertrains, charging infrastructure, energy management and other services into an integrated offering to help customers rapidly reduce transportation related emissions. We expect to work with infrastructure investors to provide non-dilutive capital to finance these assets. We believe that such an offering can reduce the barriers to adopting fleet electrification on a broader scale.

Value Proposition
 
We were founded on the principal of delivering electrification solutions to customers in ways that were affordable, offered clear and immediate economic advantages, significantly lowered CO2 emissions, and which were easily adoptable. We began by developing hybrid electric drive systems, which are far less expensive than battery electric options and require no additional charging infrastructure to operate. As battery prices have decreased, the infrastructure has slowly matured, and companies have become more capable of adopting plug-in vehicles, we have expanded our lineup to include plug-in hybrid options to meet this need.
 
Though trends toward battery electric vehicles continue to develop, we expect that the demanding drive cycles of many commercial fleet applications will limit the rate of EV adoption in many market segments. There are significant challenges preventing fleets from moving forward with large numbers of EVs, including high capital cost and lack of reliable and proven fleet-capable product options. As a result, demand for HEV and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (“PHEV”) fleet options remains strong, and we believe our focus on hybrid and plug-in hybrid options aligns with current market demand for reliable and proven fleet options that are currently available for deployment. These readily available solutions provide immediate fuel economy and sustainability value while overcoming the most pressing challenges of their all-electric counterparts. While we plan to introduce EV options that align with our customers’ ability to purchase, deploy and operate these vehicles in certain segments, we believe that our hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric drive solutions offer a number of strong value propositions for fleets today:
 

● | No charging infrastructure is required. Our hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric systems are self-charging, using regenerative braking to supplement the power of the internal combustion engine, which burns less fuel due to the hybrid assist. While the plug-in hybrid systems are able to leverage external power sources, they are not dependent upon those sources to operate the vehicle when there is a chance to supplement with an external power source, such that standard level 1 or level 2 chargers, which are more widely available and less expensive to install, are sufficient for providing their additional power.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Less expensive to purchase and operate. Our HEV and PHEV solutions can be purchased at a fraction of the cost of currently available battery-powered all electric commercial fleet vehicles, delivering immediate value and lowering operating expenses over time. Our systems may qualify for a wide range of state incentives throughout the country, but even without utilizing those programs, we believe that our systems represent one of the most cost effective electrification solutions available for commercial fleet vehicles. 
● | Readily available for fleet vehicles and applications. Because our systems are compatible with existing OEM chassis that are already in use for fleet applications, they can be quickly installed onto a wide range of popular fleet vehicles from multiple vehicle manufacturers. This creates continuity for fleets and familiarity for drivers. In addition, these vehicles continue to leverage an internal combustion engine, so there is no “range anxiety” to consider. 
● | Immediate fuel savings and sustainability value. Because they are readily deployable, our hybrid and plug-in hybrid systems can provide immediate value on fuel economy and sustainability targets. The systems can help fleets make up to 25-50% MPG improvements while reducing emissions by as much as one third. 

 
While our hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric drive systems currently offer many immediate benefits over full electric propulsion, they also help to accelerate the transition to full electric propulsion vehicles as those technologies and supporting infrastructures continue to develop. In the meantime, we are leveraging our electric powertrain supply chain and technology to develop all-electric system options, which we expect to introduce in 2022.
 
We believe the high cost of more sustainable drive systems, such as all electric, are a significant barrier to adoption for commercial fleets, especially in market segments with demanding end use applications not suitable for current EV technology. We are uniquely positioned to reach a very broad market with our hybrid and plug-in hybrid offering, including drive cycle and end use applications that are currently not viable for all electric solutions. We believe we will have an advantage with respect to the introduction of all electric solutions in certain market segments, as we expect to be able to leverage the real world operating data, various customer and operational relationships, and charging infrastructure it establishes with our hybrid and plug-in hybrid offering.
 
We believe that we are also uniquely positioned to leverage our significant installed base of customers, fleet vehicles and telematics data to expand into new lines of business. This may include new electrification categories, new vehicle classes and application possibilities (including Class 8 products and electrified refuse vehicles, among other applications), and new business models (such as EaaS).

Manufacturing and Production
 
We produce our hybrid and plug-in hybrid electrification systems from components manufactured by third party suppliers. We also rely on system installation support from certified upfitters as required to meet demand volume. Our production team resides at a leased facility in Quincy, IL. The site capabilities include receiving, warehousing, production/kitting, delivery, install/upfit training and system/component level troubleshooting. Our support functions, including supply chain, quality, and engineering operate remotely with daily contact with the production team.
Sales and Marketing
 
We maintain a sales and marketing team designed to promote, sell and communicate to our core target customers throughout the U.S. and Canada. The sales team is organized to cover both direct sales to customers and indirect sales through our two largest channels: sales and installation partners (vehicle upfitters) and fleet management companies (leasing and consulting organizations). This structure has enabled our expansion into established networks of fleet customers throughout the U.S. and Canada. The marketing team is organized to execute across external and internal go to market functions across the business, from strategy and message development to full scale program and campaign management. The marketing team is responsible for managing and executing against all aspects of our digital and offline market presence. This includes maintenance of the XL brand identity, website, digital and social media properties, online and offline advertising and demand generation, events, public relations, customer communications and more.
 
We expect to expand our sales and marketing capabilities and presence as we continue to grow.
 
Research and Development
 
We conduct research and development for product development at our headquarters located in Boston, MA, and also at our Southern California Technical Center in Foothill Ranch, CA. Both facilities are equipped with prototyping and testing capabilities to support product development. As needed, we supplement testing with outside test facilities to support product development along with ensuring compliance to applicable standards and regulations such as Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”). To support development, both facilities have engineering and support staff.
 
We develop both hybrid electric and plug-in electric solutions that are designed to integrate into OEM vehicles without voiding OEM warranties. A product development process is followed to ensure the products meet quality and timing targets while taking concepts through to production. We integrate a mixture of commercially available components and proprietary developed products to create electrified powertrain solutions. The XL developed hybrid controller that provides supervisory function and control over all subsystems of the electrified solution utilizes a modular software architecture. This approach facilitates a quicker adaption of the software updates required for different components used in the development of an electrified powertrain solution.
 
 A key feature of our hybrid and plug-in hybrid controller is the ability to remotely monitor the performance and status of the powertrain solution including diagnostics and faults. If required, we can remotely push software updates to the controller to implement updated software or address certain issues without having to bring the vehicle into a service center for such an update. Additionally, if required, the system can be remotely disabled should there be a safety concern with how the vehicle is operating.
 
Our R&D organization leadership and team have extensive experience in the commercial vehicle industry, including drive systems for the full range of Class 2-8 commercial vehicles. Our team has established concept and prototype designs for all electric range plug-in hybrid electric vehicle systems and controls, pure electric drive systems and controls, and hydrogen fuel cell electric drive systems, including heavy duty Class 7-8 applications in addition to the currently available hybrid and plug-in hybrid drive systems already available.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property, and we rely on a combination of patents, know-how, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property. As of December 31, 2020, we had 25 issued patents, including one international patent from China. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had 15 patent applications that were published (or awaiting publication) and are under examination at the U.S. Patent Office. We also have four provisional patent application that have been filed with the U.S. Patent Office. In addition to the above, eleven trademarks have been assigned to us.
 
Our intellectual property portfolio largely relates to mechanical systems, software, vehicle data analysis, vehicle control strategies, and data processing/management, and the utilization of data to optimize vehicle functions. Intellectual property is generated organically as part of our product development efforts. Concepts, ideas and solutions that are generated are reviewed to determine if they are patentable, and we hold regular executive level reviews to determine if disclosures are to be further processed for filing as a patent application.
 
We cannot conclusively state that any pending applications, existing patents or future patents will be definitively useful in protecting or promoting our business and growth plans. Please see the section entitled “Risk Factors” for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property strategy and portfolio.
 
Facilities
 
We currently operate four separate leased facilities across the U.S., strategically positioned across the East coast, Midwest and West coast in order to best leverage proximity to customers, partners and employee talent pools.
 
Our headquarters are located in Brighton, MA, a neighborhood of Boston. This flagship facility houses the majority of the executive leadership team, along with engineering, sales & marketing, finance, human resources, service and supply chain functions. The facility includes a mixture of upper floor offices and lower floor automotive engineering equipment, including vehicle lifts and a dynamometer which enables the team to conduct extensive system and emissions testing on-site. Our lease was extended to February 29, 2022.
 
Our production team resides at a leased facility in Quincy, IL. It is strategically located near OEM and key upfitter partner headquarters facilities. This facility is predominantly responsible for receiving material inventory and completing and shipping finished kits to customers. Site capabilities include receiving, warehousing, production/kitting, delivery, install/upfit training and basic system/component level troubleshooting. Our lease expires on December 31, 2021.
 
We also operate a facility in Foothill Ranch, CA which houses members of the engineering team that were brought into the business through the 2019 acquisition of Quantum Fuel’s electrification division. This team includes expertise in electrical, mechanical and systems engineering and is responsible for new product development, testing and component integration. Our lease expires in February 2025, with the option to extend for an additional 60-month term.
 
Effective February, 2021 we opened a location in Wixom, MI, which will serve as a fleet electrification technology center to support the design, development, testing and validation of a wide range of commercial vehicle electrification solutions. The facility includes a component test lab including vibration capability, a vehicle chassis dynamometer, an electronics lab and battery testing equipment. Our lease expires in February, 2024.
 
In addition, roughly 10 percent of our employees work remotely on a regular basis across a range of functions for whom frequent travel is required, including sales & marketing, service and quality. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our employees have worked remotely unless required to be at a facility to perform their core functions.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 59 full time employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, do not include any labor unions and consider our relationship with employees to be very good.
Government Regulations
 
We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive regulation. Regulatory compliance and product safety are our key areas of focus. As part of product development cycles, regulatory compliance is assessed early on in the development program and plans are implemented to assure compliance when a product is released to customers.
 
We also operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject govern, among others, water use, air emissions, use of recycled materials, energy sources, the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the protection of the environment, natural resources and endangered species and the remediation of environmental contamination. We may be required to obtain and comply with the terms and conditions of multiple environmental permits, many of which are difficult and costly to obtain and could be subject to legal challenges. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations.

Environmental standards applicable to us are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which it operates, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses that it holds. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial civil and criminal fines, penalties, orders to cease the violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits and licenses.
 
Vehicle Safety and Testing Regulation
 
The vehicles containing our systems are subject to, and required to comply with, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including applicable FMVSS. The OEMs must self-certify that its vehicles meet or are exempt from all applicable FMVSSs before a vehicle can be imported into or sold in the U.S.
 
There are numerous FMVSSs that apply to our systems that are included in our customers’ vehicles. Examples of these requirements include:
 

● | Electric Vehicle Safety—limitations on electrolyte spillage, battery retention, and avoidance of electric shock following specified crash tests;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Flammability of Interior Materials—burn resistance requirements for materials used in the occupant compartment; and 
● | Crash Tests for High-Voltage System Integrity—preventing electric shock from high voltage systems. 

 
We are also required to comply with other NHTSA requirements and federal laws administered by NHTSA, including early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports, foreign recalls, and owner’s manual requirements.
 
CARB Emissions Compliance and Certification
 
Our hybrid and plug-in hybrid systems are fitted to vehicles that have been certified to meet the requirements of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and California Air Resources Board (“CARB ”). The OEMs are responsible for ensuring compliance with the appropriate regulations for the base vehicle for emissions, fuel economy and on-board diagnostics.
 
CARB classifies the XL system as an aftermarket fit system / device. As such, CARB requires that an Executive Order (“EO”) is obtained for the sale of the system intended for use on a vehicle to be operated in the state of California. In order to obtain the EO, we are required to submit an application to CARB for each vehicle group or family, which is required for each model year. The vehicle models included in a group or family are determined by the level of commonality of vehicle systems on both the base vehicle and the hybrid or plug in hybrid systems that are fitted.
 
CARB will then issue a test order that details the required testing and the specification of the vehicle to be used to demonstrate compliance. The essence of the testing is not to confirm the performance of the hybrid or plug-in hybrid system fitted to the vehicle, but to demonstrate that addition of the system does not negatively impact the emissions or diagnostic monitoring performance of the vehicle.
 
We have obtained a number of EOs for prior model years and are in the process of conducting testing against CARB issued test orders for future products to be introduced into the California market. EOs issued by CARB to us are public record and are available to view on the CARB database for aftermarket, performance, and add-on parts. EOs also include requirements to collect data from vehicles in the field (in use data). We are pursuing new model certification with CARB.
 
We were previously certified under CARB and are currently pursuing re-certification under CARB for 2021. Our prior products offered in California were done on an individual model basis and specific for each model year. We are now pursuing approval of our systems on a system basis, which would, if approved, enable sales of a broader range of our products in California for multiple models and over multiple model years, subject to changes in design of our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such approvals on a system basis or otherwise.
 
Future XL products may include battery electric vehicles, which would require a different certification process and would be subject to both CARB and EPA testing in order to demonstrate electric range and qualify for credits if appropriate. For light duty vehicles, a zero emission vehicle certification would be required. Heavy duty electric vehicles are subject to the CARB Zero-Emission Powertrain Certification Program.
 
Battery Safety and Testing Regulation
 
Our electrified powertrain solutions are intended to meet the International Organization for Standardization’s standards for electrically propelled vehicles in vehicle operational safety specifications and connecting to an external power supply. Additionally, we may incorporate other battery system standards of the International Organization for Standardization in our electrified powertrain solutions.
 
Our battery portfolio has leveraged three commercially available Li-ion batteries. Further, we have developed a hybrid battery and a plug-in hybrid pack with industry partners. The commercially available batteries were designed and tested by the suppliers, while the developed packs went under stringent testing to comply with Society of Automotive Engineers International J2929 Standard, “Safety Standard for Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Propulsion Battery Systems Utilizing Lithium Based Rechargeable Cells.”

We have developed and instituted the recommended practice for conductive charging systems to the SAE International Surface Vehicle Standard J1722 SAE Electric Vehicle and Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler.
 
We have designed systems in accordance to SAE J2344 Guidelines for Electric Vehicle Safety mandating use of Hazardous Voltage Interlock Loop, charge interlocks, access cover interlocks, grounding practices and safety labeling for Electrical Energy Storage devices following the recommended practice of SAE J2936.
 
All XL developed batteries have been tested and meet the requirements for USDOT Federal Regulations Title 49 Part 173.185 General Requirements for Shipments and Packaging; Lithium Cells and Batteries issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Testing was performed following the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods; Manual of Tests and Criteria Section 38.3.
 
Our battery packs and modules have met the compliance requirements of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria demonstrating our ability to ship the battery packs with completion of the following tests:
 

● | Altitude Simulation 
--+--------------------------
● | Thermal Test 
● | Vibration 
● | Shock 
● | External Short Circuit 
● | Overcharge 
● | Forced Discharge (Module)

Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained.
 
On March 8, 2021, a putative class action complaint was filed in federal district court for the Southern District of New York (Suh v. XL Fleet Corp., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-02002) against us and certain of our current officers and directors (the “Suh Complaint”). On March 12, 2021, a second putative class action complaint was filed in federal district court for the Southern District of New York (Kumar v. XL Fleet Corp., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-02171) against us and certain of our current officers and directors (the “Kumar Complaint”). Both the Suh Complaint and the Kumar Complaint allege that certain public statements made by the defendants between October 2, 2020 and March 2, 2021 violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. We believe that the allegations asserted in the Suh Complaint and Kumar Complaint are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend both lawsuits. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful. At this time, we are unable to estimate potential losses, if any, related to either lawsuit.
