Recent Developments
 
Note Refinancing and 2017 Notes. On August 9, 2019, the Company and Taberna Preferred Funding I, Ltd. ("Taberna I"), Taberna Preferred Funding II, Ltd. ("Taberna II") and Kodiak CDO I Ltd. ("Kodiak" and, together with Taberna I and Taberna II, the "Noteholders") executed a First Amendment to Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement (the “Amendment”) amending the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement (as defined below) and the 2017 Notes (as defined below) to, among other things, significantly reduce the interest rate applicable from January 2019 through the third quarter of 2028 and allow the Company to apply certain surplus interest payments against future quarterly interest payments. This amendment qualified as a troubled debt restructuring. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $85.9 million in aggregate borrowings outstanding under three senior secured promissory notes (the “2017 Notes”). The unpaid principal amounts of the 2017 Notes bear interest at the following rates until the maturity date on March 30, 2033, with interest payable quarterly in arrears as follows: 1% per annum from April 1, 2019 through December 31, 2023; 2% per annum from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2028; and 10% per annum from January 1, 2029 through the maturity date. Commencing with the delivery to the Noteholders of the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, the Company is required to remit 50% of excess cash flow each year to the Noteholders to be applied as a principal reduction to the outstanding balance of the debt. The 2017 Notes generally rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future subordinated indebtedness of the Credit Parties (as defined below).  The Company may at any time upon 30 days’ notice to the Noteholders redeem all or part of the 2017 Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The 2017 Notes were entered into on July 27, 2017 as a result of a refinancing of the Company’s then outstanding senior notes with the same aggregate principal amount through the execution of the Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of the same date (as amended, the “Note Purchase Agreement”), with Novation Holding, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("NHI") and HCS as guarantors (together with the Company, collectively, the “Credit Parties”).
 
On April 1, 2019 and on July 1, 2019, the Company made payments under the 2017 Notes totaling $2.6 million. The actual aggregate amounts due for those dates totaled $0.4 million. Under the terms of the Amendment, the Company is permitted to apply the payment surplus of $2.2 million against future quarterly interest payments. Therefore, the Company will not have another quarterly interest payment due until April 1, 2022.
 
The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to certain financial covenants. Under the terms of the Amendment, the financial covenants have been waived until the quarter ending December 31, 2021. The Note Purchase Agreement also contains customary events of default, including but not limited to payment defaults, cross defaults with certain other indebtedness, breaches of covenants and bankruptcy events. In the case of an event of default, the Noteholders may, among other remedies, accelerate the payment of all obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement and the 2017 Notes. The Credit Parties entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement, dated as of the same date, pursuant to which each of the Credit Parties granted a first priority lien generally covering all of its assets, other than accounts receivable and inventory, for the benefit of the Noteholders, to secure the obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement and the 2017 Notes.
 
Under the terms of the Amendment, the Company issued to the Noteholders 9,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company and ten-year warrants allowing the Noteholders to purchase up to 22,250,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. These warrants can be exercised at any time prior to expiration. See the Company’s discussion in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Amendment.

Business
 
Established in 1995, HCS is the largest outsourced healthcare services provider in the State of Georgia. HCS delivers outsourced full-time and part-time employees primarily to Community Service Boards (“CSB”).  HCS has long-term relationships with many of its customers and has been providing services to several clients for more than 15 years. A CSB is a quasi-state organization providing behavioral health services at facilities across Georgia including mental health services, developmental disabilities programs and substance abuse treatments. The State of Georgia has a total of 25 CSBs. Each CSB has a number of facilities, including crisis centers, outpatient centers and 24-hour group homes that require a broad range of employees, such as registered nurses, social workers, house parents and supervisors. The CSB market in Georgia is large and growing steadily, as the demand for the services provided by the CSB continues to grow. In addition to providing outsourced employees to CSBs, HCS also provides healthcare outsourcing and staffing services to hospitals, schools, crisis units, clinics, doctors offices, prisons and a variety of privately owned businesses. The services and positions provided to these clients are similar to the ones provided to CSB clients.
Strategy
 
The strategy of HCS is to continue expanding its market share in providing healthcare staffing services in Georgia and in particular serving Georgia CSBs. HCS is the dominant player in providing services to Georgia CSBs and plans to increase its market share of the CSB business. HCS will also continue to expand business to additional hospitals, private group homes, clinics, rest homes, prisons and retirement centers. Furthermore, the HCS strategy includes expanding clerical staff within existing customers, as well as gaining new clients. The longer-term strategy includes expansion beyond the Georgia market and may include acquisitions of staffing companies outside of Georgia, particularly in states that have public health infrastructure similar to that of Georgia.
Competition
 
HCS competes with numerous national staffing and recruiting businesses that specialize in the medical and healthcare industry, such as Nursefinders, Lighthouse Recruiting, Action Med and Brightstar. Other national staffing businesses have divisions that compete with HCS in Georgia, including ATC Healthcare, Kelly Services, Interim, Randstad and Maxim. Numerous Georgia non-national and smaller staffing providers also compete with HCS.
Regulation
 
The healthcare industry is subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations related to, among other things, conduct of operations, and costs and payment for services. HCS is not directly regulated as a healthcare provider, although the customers of HCS are highly regulated. Therefore, HCS complies with many of the regulations prescribed for its customers.
 
HCS provides services directly to its clients on a contract basis and receives payment directly from them. However, many clients are reimbursed under the federal Medicare program and state Medicaid programs for the services they provide. Therefore, HCS also may be affected indirectly by reimbursement changes in government programs, particularly Medicare and Medicaid.
 
 Employees


 As of February 25, 2021, the Company employed 1,025 full-time employees and 388 part-time employees. None of the Company's employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
