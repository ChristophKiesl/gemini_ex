ITEM 1. Business.
Overview
Ford Motor Credit Company LLC was incorporated in Delaware in 1959 and converted to a limited liability company in 2007. We are an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company (“Ford”). Our principal executive offices are located at One American Road, Dearborn, Michigan 48126, and our telephone number is (313) 322-3000.
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act are available free of charge through our website located at www.fordcredit.com/investor-center.  These reports can also be found on the SEC’s website located at www.sec.gov. 
Our website and its content are not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (“2021 Form 10-K Report” or “Report”) nor filed with the SEC.
Products and Services. We offer a wide variety of automotive financing products to and through automotive dealers throughout the world. The predominant share of our business consists of financing Ford and Lincoln vehicles and supporting the dealers of those brands. We earn our revenue primarily from: 
•Payments made under retail installment sale and finance lease (retail financing) and operating lease contracts that we originate and purchase;
•Interest rate supplements and other support payments from Ford and affiliated companies; and
•Payments made under dealer financing programs.
As a result of our financing activities, we have a large portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases which we classify into two portfolios – “consumer” and “non-consumer”. 
Finance receivables and operating leases in the consumer portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of Ford and Lincoln vehicles from dealers for personal and commercial use. Retail financing includes retail installment sale contracts for new and used vehicles and finance leases (comprised of sales-type and direct financing leases) for new vehicles to retail and commercial customers, including leasing companies, government entities, daily rental companies, and fleet customers.
Finance receivables in the non-consumer portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers and receivables related to Ford and its affiliates. We make wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory, also known as floorplan financing, as well as loans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership real estate, and finance other dealer vehicle programs. We also purchase receivables from Ford and its affiliates, primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers and certain used vehicles from daily rental fleet companies. In addition, we provide financing to Ford for vehicles that Ford leases to its employees. 
We also service the finance receivables and operating leases we originate and purchase, make loans to Ford affiliates, and provide insurance services related to our financing programs.
Geographic Scope of Operations and Segment Information. We conduct our financing operations directly and indirectly through our subsidiaries and affiliates. We offer substantially similar products and services throughout many different regions, subject to local legal restrictions and market conditions. We segment our business based on geographic regions: the United States and Canada, Europe, and All Other. Items excluded in assessing segment performance because they are managed at the corporate level, i.e., market valuation adjustments to derivatives and exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated transactions, are reflected in Unallocated Other. For additional financial information regarding our operations by business segment and operations by geographic region, see Note 15 of our Notes to the Financial Statements. 
Item 1. Business (Continued)

United States and Canada Segment 
Our United States and Canada segment represented 80% and 81% of total managed receivables at year-end 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our United States operations accounted for 87% of the United States and Canada segment total managed receivables at both year-end 2020 and 2021. For additional information on how we review our business performance, including on a managed basis, refer to the “Overview” section of Item 7. Managed receivables are defined further in the “Financial Condition” section of Item 7.
Under the Ford Credit and Lincoln Automotive Financial Services brand names, we provide financing services to and through dealers of Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Operations in some markets may also include joint ventures with local financial institutions and other third parties. In addition, other private label operations and alternative business arrangements exist in some markets.
Europe Segment 
Our operations in Europe are managed primarily through a United Kingdom-based subsidiary, FCE Bank plc (“FCE”), along with affiliates in Poland, the Netherlands, and Belgium. This segment represented 17% and 15% of total managed receivables at year-end 2020 and 2021, respectively. FCE operates in the United Kingdom, has branches in eight other European countries, and it has operating subsidiaries in Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary that provide a variety of retail and dealer financing. The United Kingdom and Germany are our largest markets in Europe, representing 62% and 64% of Europe segment managed receivables at year-end 2020 and 2021, respectively. Customers and dealers in Italy, France, and Spain were 27% and 29% of Europe segment managed receivables at year-end 2020 and 2021, respectively. FCE, through its Worldwide Trade Financing (“WWTF”) division, provides financing to distributors and importers in about 70 countries where Ford has no national sales company presence representing 1% of Europe segment managed receivables at both year-end 2020 and 2021. In addition, other private label operations and alternative business arrangements exist in some markets.
All Other Segment 
Our All Other segment includes operations in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, China, India, and a joint venture in South Africa. This segment represented 3% and 4% of total managed receivables at year-end 2020 and 2021, respectively. In addition, other private label operations and alternative business arrangements exist in some markets. In June 2021, we announced that our subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina had committed to a plan to cease originating receivables by the end of 2021 and would begin the process of selling or otherwise winding down operations in those markets. We have also begun to cease operations in India.
Dependence on Ford
The predominant share of our business consists of financing Ford and Lincoln vehicles and supporting Ford and Lincoln dealers. Any extended reduction or suspension of Ford’s production or sale of vehicles due to a decline in consumer demand, work stoppage, governmental action, negative publicity, or other event, or significant changes to marketing programs sponsored by Ford, would have an adverse effect on our business. Additional information about Ford’s business, operations, production, sales, and risks can be found in Ford’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (“Ford’s 2021 Form 10-K Report”), filed separately with the SEC. 
Ford has sponsored special financing programs available only through us. Under these programs, Ford makes interest supplements or other support payments to us. These programs increase our financing volume and share of financing sales and operating leases of Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Similar programs may be offered in the future. For additional information regarding interest supplements and other support costs received from affiliated companies, see Notes 4 and 5 of our Notes to the Financial Statements.
Item 1. Business (Continued)

Competition 
The automotive financing business is highly competitive, due in part to credit aggregation systems that permit dealers to send credit applications to multiple finance sources to evaluate financing options offered by these finance sources. Our principal competitors are:
•Banks;
•Independent finance companies;
•Credit unions;
•Leasing companies; and
•Other automobile manufacturers’ affiliated finance companies.
We compete mainly on the basis of service and financing rate programs, including those sponsored by Ford. A key foundation of our service is providing broad and consistent purchasing policies for retail financing and operating lease contracts, and consistent support for dealer financing requirements across economic cycles. These policies have helped us build strong relationships with Ford’s dealer network that enhance our competitiveness. Our ability to provide competitive financing rates depends on effectively and efficiently originating, purchasing, and servicing our receivables, and efficiently accessing the capital markets. We routinely monitor the capital markets and develop funding plans to optimize our competitive position. Ford-sponsored special financing programs available only through us give us a competitive advantage in providing financing to Ford dealers and their customers.
Seasonal Variations 
As a finance company, we own and manage a large portfolio of receivables that are generated throughout the year and are collected over a number of years, primarily in fixed monthly payments. As a result, our overall financing revenues do not exhibit seasonal variations.
Consumer Financing
Overview and Purchasing Process
We provide financing services to customers for personal and commercial use through automotive dealers that have established relationships with us. Our primary business consists of originating and purchasing retail financing and operating lease contracts for new and used vehicles from Ford and Lincoln dealers. We report in our financial statements the receivables from customers under retail financing contracts as finance receivables. We report in our financial statements most of our retail leases as net investment in operating leases with the capitalized cost of the vehicles recorded as depreciable assets.
In general, we purchase from dealers retail financing and operating lease contracts that meet our purchase standards. These contracts primarily relate to the purchase or lease of new vehicles, but some are for used vehicles. Dealers typically submit customer applications electronically. We automatically obtain information on the applicant including a credit bureau score, if available. We use a proprietary scoring system that measures credit quality using information from sources including the credit application, proposed contract terms, and credit bureau data. After a proprietary risk score is generated, we decide whether to purchase a contract using a decision process based on a judgmental evaluation of the applicant, the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score), proprietary risk score, and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, applicant credit history, and stability as key considerations. Purchase decisions are made within a framework of Ford Credit’s purchase quality and risk factor guidelines. Credit applications are typically evaluated by our electronic decisioning process, which may approve or reject applications. 
Retail Financing
The amount we pay for a retail installment sale contract is based on a negotiated vehicle purchase price agreed to between the dealer and the retail customer, less vehicle trade-in allowance or down payment from the customer and special marketing cash payments offered by Ford Credit and Ford, plus any additional products, such as insurance and extended service plans, that are included in the contract. The net purchase price owed by the customer typically is paid over a specified number of months with interest at a fixed rate negotiated between the dealer and the retail customer. The dealer may retain a limited portion of the finance charge.
Item 1. Business (Continued)

We offer a variety of retail installment sale financing products. The average original term of our retail installment sale contracts in the United States was 68 months and 63 months for contracts purchased in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The term decrease is explained by marketing programs limiting the most popular incentive rates to 48-months or less compared to the 2020 programs that offered 0% financing for 84-months in response to COVID-19. A small portion of our retail installment sale contracts have non-uniform payment periods and payment amounts to accommodate special cash flow situations. 
In most markets, we hold a security interest in the vehicles purchased through retail installment sale contracts. This security interest provides us certain rights and protections. As a result, if our collection efforts fail to bring a delinquent customer’s payments current, we generally can repossess the customer’s vehicle, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it at auction. The customer typically remains liable for any deficiency between net auction proceeds and the defaulted contract obligations, including any repossession-related expenses. We generally require retail customers to carry fire, theft, and collision insurance on financed vehicles.
We offer vehicle-financing programs to retail and commercial customers including leasing companies, government entities, daily rental companies, and fleet customers through sales-type and direct financing leases. These financings include primarily lease plans for terms of 24 to 60 months. We hold a security interest in financed vehicles in almost all instances.  At the end of the finance term, a lease customer may be required to pay any shortfall between the fair market value and the specified end of term value of the vehicle. If the fair market value of the vehicle at the end of the finance term exceeds the specified end of term value, the lease customer may be paid the excess amount. These financings are included in our consumer segment and reported as retail financing. We also offer a retail balloon product in the United States and Europe under which the retail customer may finance a vehicle with an installment sale contract with a series of monthly payments followed by paying the amount remaining in a single balloon payment. The customer can satisfy the balloon payment obligation by payment in full of the amount owed, by refinancing the amount owed, or by returning the vehicle and paying any contractually agreed additional charges for excess mileage or excess wear and use. Generally, we sell vehicles returned to us to Ford dealers and non-Ford dealers through auctions. 
Net Investment in Operating Leases
We offer leasing plans to retail customers through our dealers. Our highest volume retail-leasing plan is called Red Carpet Lease, which is offered in the United States and Canada through dealers of Ford and Lincoln brands. Under these plans, dealers originate the leases and offer them to us for purchase. Upon our purchase of a lease, we take ownership of the lease and title to the leased vehicle from the dealer. After we purchase a lease from a dealer, the dealer generally has no further obligation to us in connection with the lease. The customer is responsible for properly maintaining the vehicle and is obligated to pay for excess wear and use as well as excess mileage, if any. At the end of the lease, the customer has the option to purchase the vehicle for the price specified in the lease contract, or return the vehicle to the dealer. If the customer returns the vehicle to the dealer, the dealer may buy the vehicle from us or return it to us. We generally sell vehicles returned to us to Ford and non-Ford dealers through auctions.
The amount we pay to a dealer for a lease, also called the acquisition cost, is based on the negotiated vehicle price agreed to between the dealer and the retail customer, less any vehicle trade-in allowance or down payment from the customer and special marketing cash payments offered by Ford Credit and Ford, plus any additional products, such as insurance and extended service plans, that are included in the contract. The customer makes monthly lease payments based on the purchase price less the contractual residual value of the vehicle, plus lease charges. Some of our lease programs, such as our Red Carpet Lease Advance Payment Plan, provide certain pricing advantages to customers who make all or some monthly payments at lease inception or purchase refundable higher mileage allowances. We generally require lease customers to carry fire, theft, liability, and collision insurance on leased vehicles. In the case of a contract default and repossession, the customer typically remains liable for any deficiency between net auction proceeds and the defaulted contract obligations, including any repossession-related expenses.
In the United States, operating lease terms for new vehicles range primarily from 24 to 39 months. The average original lease term for contracts purchased was 34 months for both 2020 and 2021. 
Item 1. Business (Continued)

Non-Consumer Financing 
Overview
We extend credit to franchised dealers selling Ford and Lincoln vehicles primarily in the form of approved lines of credit to purchase new and used vehicles. Each lending request is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrower’s financial condition, supporting security, and numerous other financial and qualitative factors. Generally, receivables are secured by the related vehicle or the related property and may also be secured by other dealer assets. Asset verification processes are in place and generally include physical audits of vehicle inventories with increased audit frequency for higher-risk dealers.
Dealer Financing 
Wholesale Financing. We offer a wholesale financing program for qualifying dealers to finance new and used vehicles held in inventory (also known as floorplan financing). We generally finance the vehicle’s wholesale invoice price for new vehicles and up to 100% of the dealer’s purchase price for used vehicles. Dealers generally pay a floating interest rate on wholesale loans. In the United States, the average new wholesale receivable, excluding the time the vehicle was in transit from the assembly plant to the dealership, was outstanding for 85 days in 2020 compared with 50 days in 2021, primarily due to the semiconductor shortage. Our wholesale financing program includes financing of large multi-brand dealer groups. 
When a dealer uses our wholesale financing program to purchase vehicles, we obtain a security interest in the vehicles and, in many instances, other assets of the dealer. In the United States and Canada, our wholly owned subsidiary, The American Road Insurance Company (“TARIC”), generally provides insurance for vehicle damage and theft of vehicles held in dealer inventory that are financed by us.
Dealer Loans. We make loans to dealers to finance the purchase of dealership real estate, to make improvements to dealership facilities, and to provide working capital. These loans are typically secured by mortgages on dealership real estate and/or by security interests in other dealership assets. In addition, these loans are generally supported by personal guarantees from the individual owners of the dealership. 
Other Dealer Financing. We also provide financing to qualified dealers for vehicles to be utilized for service replacement and retail rental use. In addition, we provide financing to qualified daily rental companies for new and used vehicles used in their operations.
Other Financing
We also purchase receivables from Ford and its affiliates, primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers and certain used vehicles from daily rental fleet companies. In addition, we provide financing to Ford for vehicles that Ford leases to its employees. These receivables are excluded from our credit quality reporting since the performance of this group of receivables is generally guaranteed by Ford. 
Marketing and Special Programs 
We actively market our financing products and services to automotive dealers and customers. We demonstrate to dealers the value of a business relationship with us through personal sales contacts, targeted advertisements in trade publications, and participation in dealer-focused conventions and organizations. Our marketing strategy is based on our belief that we can better assist dealers in achieving their sales, financial, and customer satisfaction goals by being a reliable finance source with knowledgeable automotive and financial professionals offering personal attention and interaction. We demonstrate our commitment to dealer relationships with a variety of materials, measurements, and analyses showing the advantages of a full range of automotive financing products that allows consistent and predictable single source financing. We promote increased dealer transactions through incentives, bonuses, contests, and selected program and rate adjustments.
Item 1. Business (Continued)

We promote our retail financing products primarily through pre-approved credit offers to prospective customers, point-of-sale information, and ongoing communications with existing customers. Our communications to these customers promote the advantages of our financing products, the availability of special plans and programs, and the benefits of affiliated products, such as extended warranties, service plans, insurance coverage, gap protection, and excess wear and use waivers. We also emphasize the quality of our customer service and the ease of making payments and transacting business with us. For example, through our website located at www.ford.com/finance and www.lincoln.com/finance or via our FordPass mobile application, a customer can make inquiries, review an account balance, examine current incentives, schedule an electronic payment, or qualify for a pre-approved credit offer.
We also market our non-consumer financing services with a specialized group of employees who make direct sales calls on dealers and, often at the request of such dealers, on potential high-volume commercial customers. This group also uses various materials to explain our flexible programs and services specifically directed at the needs of commercial and fleet vehicle customers.
Servicing
Consumer Financing
After we purchase retail financing contracts and operating leases from dealers and other customers, we manage the contracts during their contract terms. This management process is called servicing. We service the finance receivables and operating leases we originate and purchase. Our servicing duties include the following:
•Applying monthly payments from customers;
•Maintaining a security interest in the financed vehicle;
•Providing billing statements to customers;
•Responding to customer inquiries;
•Releasing our security interest on paid-off finance contracts;
•Contacting delinquent customers for payment;
•Arranging for the repossession of vehicles; and 
•Selling repossessed and returned vehicles. 
Customer Payment Operations. Customers may make payments by mailing checks to a bank for deposit in a lockbox account, through electronic payment services, a direct debit program, or a telephonic payment system.
Collections. We design our collection strategies and procedures to keep accounts current and to collect on delinquent accounts. We employ a combination of proprietary and non-proprietary tools to assess the probability and severity of default for all of our finance receivables and operating leases and implement our collection efforts based on our determination of the credit risk associated with each customer. As each customer develops a payment history, we use an internally developed behavioral scoring model to assist in determining the best collection strategies. Based on data from this scoring model, contracts are categorized by collection risk. Our centralized collection operations are supported by auto-dialing technology and proprietary collection and workflow operating systems. Through our auto-dialer program and our monitoring and call log systems, we target our efforts on contacting customers about missed payments and developing satisfactory solutions to bring accounts current.
Supplier Operations. We engage vendors to perform some of our servicing processes. These processes include depositing monthly payments from customers, monitoring, processing, and storing documents and certificates of title that reflect the perfection of security interests and ownership in financed and leased vehicles, imaging of contracts and electronic data file maintenance, storing and processing paper and electronic contracts, generating and sending billing statements and other written communications to customers, providing telephonic payment systems for retail customers, handling of some inbound and outbound collections calls, and recovering deficiencies for selected accounts. 
Item 1. Business (Continued)

Payment Extensions. A payment extension defers one or more past due payments and moves the scheduled maturity date by the number of months extended. Our guidelines for offering a payment extension generally require that the customer’s payment problem is temporary, the customer has an income source for making the next payment, and the customer has made at least one payment since the contract’s origination. Payment extensions are reviewed regularly by our servicing managers. When allowed by state law, we usually collect a fee on extensions. 
Repossessions and Off-Lease Vehicles. We view repossession of a financed or leased vehicle as a final step that we undertake only after all other collection efforts have failed. Our United States and Canada systems also employ a web-based network of outside contractors who support the repossession process. In all of our markets, we sell repossessed vehicles and apply the proceeds to the amount owed on the customer’s account. We continue to attempt collection of any deficient amounts until the account is paid in full, we obtain mutually satisfactory payment arrangements with the debtor, or we determine that the account is uncollectible. Repossessed vehicles are reported in Other assets on our balance sheets at the lower of their carrying value or values that approximate expected net auction proceeds. 
We manage the sale of returned leased vehicles and repossessed vehicles. We inspect and recondition the vehicle to maximize the net auction value of the vehicle. Returned leased vehicles are predominantly sold through an online auction, closed auctions in which only Ford and Lincoln dealers may participate, or at open auctions in which any licensed dealer can participate. Typically, repossessed vehicles are sold at open auctions. 
Non-Consumer Financing
In the United States and Canada, we require dealers to submit monthly financial statements that we monitor for potential credit deterioration. We assign an evaluation rating to each dealer, which, among other things, determines the frequency of physical audits of vehicle inventory.  We electronically audit vehicle inventory utilizing integrated systems allowing us to access information from Ford reported sales. We monitor dealer inventory financing payoffs to detect deviations from typical repayment patterns and take appropriate actions. If a dealer fails to make principal or interest payments when due and remediation steps are unsuccessful, we will classify the dealer as “status” and may take one or more of the following actions: demand payment of all or a portion of the related receivables; suspend the dealer’s credit lines; place Ford Credit employees or security personnel at the dealership; secure the dealer’s inventory; require certified funds for all vehicles sold by the dealer; initiate legal actions to exercise rights under the floorplan financing agreement; or increase the dealer’s floorplan interest rate. If a loss appears imminent, we will attempt to redistribute new vehicle inventory, liquidate all remaining collateral, enforce any third-party guarantees, and charge off any remaining amounts as uncollectible. 
We also provide financing to fleet purchasers, leasing companies, daily rental companies, and other commercial customers. We generally review our exposure under these credit arrangements at least annually.
In addition, we may service wholesale receivables that have been sold to third parties or wholesale receivables that are originated by a third party. 
Outside of the United States and Canada, non-consumer financing is managed by the respective regional offices, executed within the local markets, and similar risk management principles are applied. 
Item 1. Business (Continued)

Insurance 
We conduct insurance underwriting operations primarily through TARIC in the United States and Canada. TARIC offers a variety of products and services, including:
•Physical damage insurance coverage for Ford Credit financed vehicles at dealer locations;
•Physical damage insurance coverage for non-affiliated company financed vehicles, serviced by Ford Credit, at dealer locations;
•Physical damage insurance coverage for Ford and Lincoln vehicles in transit between final assembly plants and dealer locations;
•Contractual liability insurance on extended service contracts for Ford and its affiliates; and
•Commercial automobile and general liability insurance and surety bonds for Ford in the United States. 
TARIC invests premiums, other revenue, and its capital and surplus to fund future claims, and has established investment guidelines and strategies to reflect its risk tolerance, regulatory requirements, and rating agency considerations, among other factors. TARIC is rated by A.M. Best Company on its financial strength and issuer credit rating. Since 2012, TARIC’s rating has been A (Excellent) for its financial strength and “a” (Excellent) on its issuer credit rating and has a “stable” outlook.
We also offer various Ford-branded insurance products throughout the world underwritten by non-affiliated insurance companies from which we receive fee income, but the underwriting risk remains with the non-affiliated insurance companies. Premiums from our insurance business generated 1% of our total revenue in both 2020 and 2021.
Human Capital Resources
People Strategy and Governance
Caring for each other through valuing diversity, embracing inclusion, celebrating success, encouraging new thinking, supporting each other through change, and winning as a team is a key element of our plan to drive long-term business success. Our ultimate parent, Ford Motor Company, maintains an Executive People Forum consisting of the CEO and top leadership team that meets monthly with a specific focus on people and organizational topics that will enable and accelerate delivery of the business plan. Key topic areas include our Enterprise People Strategy, Organization Design & Workforce Planning, Talent Planning & Development, and Leadership Development & Culture. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
At Ford and Ford Credit, we believe that creating a Culture of Belonging for all our employees is both foundational to achieving our Ford+ plan and the right thing to do. We offer 11 Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) that represent various dimensions of our employee population, including racial, ethnic, gender, religious, sexual orientation and gender identity, ability, and generational communities with chapters throughout the world, in addition to Ford Advocacy for Belonging (“FAB”) Councils in every region. The ERGs and FAB Councils are instrumental in providing a voice to our globally diverse workforce as well as sharing valuable insights into the development of products, services, and experiences. Our holistic DEI strategy includes a strong focus on racial equity and DEI education. 
Talent Attraction and Capability Assessment
In an environment where many employees are no longer bound to physical locations, where and how we source our talent is evolving. From a capability perspective, we are leveraging best practices in assessments and talent management to strengthen our current capabilities and future pipeline while reinforcing a culture of belonging, empowerment, and innovation. Further, we are also creating targeted learning experiences, democratizing learning and career development opportunities across the organization, and empowering employees to design their own career paths with skill development targeted for the roles of today and the future. Finally, the extent to which our People Leaders are equipped to care for, inspire, and empower our people plays a vital role in our strategy, and we are committed to helping our leaders strengthen these capabilities with dedicated learning paths and non-traditional learning opportunities. In 2021, we established Leadership+, a new mechanism for developing People Leaders and delivering key messages related to that role, including demonstrating care, fostering psychological safety, instilling a challenger mindset, and leading through the evolution of work. Through Leadership+, we have activated People Leaders - quickly and at scale - to help deliver Ford+.
Item 1. Business (Continued)

Employee Health and Safety
Nothing is more important than the health, safety, and well-being of our people, and we consistently strive to achieve world-class levels of safety, through the application of policies and best practices. We maintain a robust safety culture to reduce workplace injuries, supported by effective communication, reporting, and external benchmarking. 
Ford and Ford Credit continue to address the complexity of the global COVID-19 pandemic, including how we support and protect our employees, the communities in which we operate, and our Company assets. The COVID-19 Business Resumption Plan, i.e., “The Return-To-Work Playbook,” continues to guide our efforts to protect our employees as the pandemic continues. The Return-To-Work Playbook is our corporate guideline and aligns with recommendations from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and country and local health departments. The Playbook’s core objective is to protect our employees and provide a safe work environment. The main elements of the Playbook include:
•Guidelines and requirements for completion of a daily health check survey 
•Guidelines for temperature scanning prior to entering certain facilities
•Guidelines for appropriate use and application of Personal Protective Equipment
•Guidelines and recommendations for social distancing inside and outside of workstations
•Cleaning and disinfecting workstations and common areas
•Guidelines supporting handwashing methods and frequency
•Placement strategy for hand sanitizer stations 
We will continue to be vigilant and proactive in our efforts to effectively manage the COVID-19 pandemic.
Employee Wellbeing Initiatives
Our global, holistic approach to wellbeing encompasses the financial, social, mental/emotional, physical, and professional needs of our employees. Foundational to our wellbeing philosophy is providing a broad array of resources and solutions to educate employees and build capability and support for meeting individual wellbeing needs and goals. Wellbeing is an integral part of our total rewards strategy as we work to address business and employee challenges through a multi-channel approach that provides our diverse populations and global regions flexibility and choice to meet their specific needs. 
We use data driven insights gathered through surveys, focus groups, and claims data to understand employee needs and prioritize our wellbeing efforts. Through our wellbeing offerings, e.g., work from home support and enhanced childcare and parental resources, we provide employees with experiences, self-guided tools, and access to the professional support and resources they need to achieve their own sense of wellbeing. We are committed to creating an environment where employees and People Leaders care for each other as we deliver Ford+. 
Employee Sentiment Strategy
We leverage our ask/listen/observe framework to understand employee sentiment at Ford and Ford Credit. This approach is a holistic and consistent methodology that enables us to understand how employees are feeling in real time and act accordingly. Our measurement focuses on several areas that are key to our business: Employee Mental and Emotional Wellbeing, Health & Safety (including our COVID-19 safety protocols), Employee Experience, Culture, DEI, Leadership, and Strategic Alignment. A critical element of our measurement program is ensuring that data ends up in the hands of those who are best positioned to drive meaningful change. To this end, leaders at all levels have access to dashboards with data from their teams and organizations, as well as personalized next step recommendations embedded into action planning tools. Our measurement approach is also used to inform our areas of focus as an organization and to evaluate the effectiveness of talent initiatives across the enterprise. 
Employee Data
We employed approximately 6,400 and 5,600 full-time employees worldwide at year-end 2020 and 2021, respectively. The reduction in employees in 2021 is primarily a result of efficiencies in North America, and the restructuring of our operations in South America. Most of our employees are salaried and are not represented by a union.
Item 1. Business (Continued)

Governmental Regulations
As a finance company, we are highly regulated by the governmental authorities in the locations where we operate.
United States
Within the United States, our operations are subject to regulation and supervision under various federal, state, and local laws.
Federal Regulation. We are subject to federal regulation, including the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. These laws require us to provide certain disclosures to prospective purchasers and lessees in consumer retail financing and operating lease transactions and prohibit discriminatory credit practices. The principal disclosures required under the Truth-in-Lending Act for retail financing transactions include the terms of repayment, the amount financed, the total finance charge, and the annual percentage rate. For operating lease transactions, under the Consumer Leasing Act, we are required to disclose the amount due at lease inception, the terms for payment, and information about lease charges, insurance, excess mileage, wear and use charges, and liability on early termination. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants and customers on a variety of factors, including race, color, sex, age, or marital status. Pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, creditors are required to make certain disclosures regarding consumer rights and advise consumers whose credit applications are not approved of the reasons for being denied. In addition, any of the credit scoring systems we use during the application process or other processes must comply with the requirements for such systems under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires us to provide certain information to consumers whose credit applications are not approved on the basis of a consumer credit report obtained from a national credit bureau and sets forth requirements related to identity theft, privacy, and accuracy in credit reporting. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), it is unlawful for us to engage in any unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice. We are also subject to the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act that provides additional protections for certain customers in the military such as prohibiting us from charging interest in excess of 6% on transactions with those customers, limiting our ability to collect future payments from those operating lease customers who terminate their lease early, and limiting our use of self-help repossession of the vehicle for those customers. We are subject to other federal regulation, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires us to maintain confidentiality and safeguard certain consumer data in our possession and to communicate periodically with consumers on privacy matters. In addition, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has broad rule-making and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer financial protection laws that regulate consumer finance businesses, such as Ford Credit’s financing business. For additional discussion of the CFPB, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”.
We are also subject to regulation in our funding and securitization activities, including requirements under federal securities laws and specific rules and requirements for asset-backed securities. Derivative activities are regulated under the Commodities Exchange Act and Dodd-Frank Act. These regulations also impose operational and reporting requirements for these funding transactions. 
State Regulation - Licensing. In most states, a consumer credit regulatory agency regulates and enforces laws relating to finance companies. Rules and regulations generally provide for licensing of finance companies, limitations on the amount, duration, and charges, including interest rates, that can be included in finance contracts, requirements as to the form and content of finance contracts and other documentation, and restrictions on collection practices and creditors’ rights. We must renew these licenses periodically. In periods of high interest rates, rate limitations could have an adverse effect on our operations if we were unable to purchase retail installment sale contracts with finance charges that reflect our increased costs. In certain states, we are subject to periodic examination by state regulatory authorities.
State Regulation - Repossessions. To mitigate our credit losses, sometimes we repossess a financed or leased vehicle. Repossessions are subject to prescribed legal procedures, including peaceful repossession, one or more customer notifications, a prescribed waiting period prior to disposition of the repossessed vehicle, and return of personal items to the customer. Some states provide the customer with reinstatement rights that require us to return a repossessed vehicle to the customer in certain circumstances. Our ability to repossess and sell a repossessed vehicle is restricted if a customer declares bankruptcy.

International 
In some countries outside the United States, some of our subsidiaries, including FCE and Ford Bank GmbH (“Ford Bank”), are regulated and/or licensed banking institutions and are required, among other things, to maintain minimum capital and liquidity. FCE is authorized by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and the PRA to carry on a range of regulated activities within the United Kingdom. Ford Bank is authorized by the European Central Bank and regulated by both the German Bundesbank and the German Federal Supervisory Authority (“BaFin”). In many locations where we operate, governmental authorities require us to obtain equivalent banking licenses to conduct our business.
Regulatory Compliance Status
Based on our compliance management processes and procedures, we believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in material compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to us and our operations. Failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, reputation, and/or liquidity. Further, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or the revision of existing laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, and/or liquidity.
We actively monitor proposed changes to relevant legal and regulatory requirements in order to maintain our compliance. Through our governmental relations efforts, we also attempt to participate in the legislative and administrative rule-making process on regulatory initiatives that impact finance companies. The cost of our ongoing compliance efforts has not had a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
For additional information on new or increased credit regulations, consumer or data protection regulations, or other regulations, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
