Markets
 
The Company will focus on the following markets in developing its core business:
 
Platform “Avalon Cell”
 
Regarded as the future of medicine, cell-based therapeutics will replace pharmaceuticals as a more effective and functional modality in disease treatment. Avalon is actively engaging in this revolutionary trend and positioning to take a leading role in cell-based technology and therapeutics. The business model for our “Avalon Cell” platform is based on stringent criteria in selection and evaluation of candidate projects at different stages of their developmental cycle. We particularly focus on projects with strong intellectual property and distinctive innovation, translational, application-driven, as well as commercialization-ready. Our technology-based platform, “Avalon Cell”, comprises four programs:

Annual Fee
 
We generally charge a fixed annual fee to be retained for our services which can vary depending on the work required.
 

Strategic Development
 
We intend to focus on three components. The initial component will be focused on acquiring and/or managing fixed assets including healthcare real estate as well as stem cell banks. In addition, we intend to pursue the acquisition and development of healthcare related technologies through acquisition, licensing or joint ventures. We will also consider a third avenue of investing in certain technologies.
Intellectual Property
 
We have not applied for or received patent protection in the US or any other country, and, as a result, there is a distinct risk that we will not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these countries. We own and control a variety of trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights that, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We consider our trademarks, service marks, and other intellectual property to be proprietary, and rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, non-disclosure, and contractual safeguards to protect our intellectual property rights.
Competition
 
In our current consulting business in the PRC, we compete with a number of advisory firm offering similar service including consulting and strategy firms; market research, data, benchmarking, and forecasting providers; technology vendors and services firms; health care information technology firms; technology advisory firms; outsourcing firms; and specialized providers of educational and training services. Other organizations, such as state and national trade associations, group purchasing organizations, non-profit think-tanks, and database companies, also may offer research, consulting, tools, and education services to health care and education organizations.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include quality and timeliness of our services, strength and depth of relationships with our clients, ability to meet the changing needs of current and prospective clients, measurable returns on customer investment, and service and affordability.
 
As our business develops and we expand through joint ventures, acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the U.S and PRC, we will have competition with other direct service providers, emerging technologies and medical communication platforms. Avalon will seek to maintain a competitive advantage through intellectual property, superior quality management and cutting edge technology.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we are subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to our normal business operations. We are not currently a party to, and our property is not subject to, any material legal proceedings.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed three employees, two of which served as our executive officers. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining arrangement.
Government Regulation
 
The health care industry in the PRC and U.S. is highly regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Further, the healthcare industry is currently undergoing rapid change. We are uncertain how, when or in what context these new changes will be adopted or implemented. These new regulations could create unexpected liabilities for us, could cause us or our members to incur additional costs and could restrict our or our clients’ operations. Many of the laws are complex and their application to us, our clients, or the specific services and relationships we have with our members are not always clear. Our failure to anticipate accurately the application of these laws and regulations, or our other failure to comply, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and otherwise negatively affect our business.

Despite efforts to develop its legal system over the past several decades, including but not limited to legislation dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, the PRC continues to lack a comprehensive system of laws. Further, the laws that do exist in the PRC are often vague, ambiguous and difficult to enforce, which could negatively affect our ability to do business in China and compete with other companies in our segments.
 
In September 2006, the Ministry of Commerce ("MOFCOM") promulgated the Regulations on Foreign Investors' Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises (“M&A Regulations”) in an effort to better regulate foreign investment in PRC. The M&A Regulations were adopted in part as a needed codification of certain joint venture formation and operating practices, and also in response to the government's increasing concern about protecting domestic companies in perceived key industries and those associated with national security, as well as the outflow of well-known trademarks, including traditional Chinese brands.
 
As a U.S. based company doing business in PRC, we seek to comply with all PRC laws, rules and regulations and pronouncements, and endeavor to obtain all necessary approvals from applicable PRC regulatory agencies such as the MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange ("SAFE").
 
Company History
 
On October 19, 2016, we entered into and closed a Share Exchange Agreement with the shareholders of Avalon Healthcare System, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“AHS”), each of which are accredited investors (“AHS Shareholders”) pursuant to which we acquired 100% of the outstanding securities of AHS in exchange for 50,000,000 shares of our common stock (the “AHS Acquisition”). Considering that, following the acquisition, the AHS Shareholders control the majority of our outstanding voting common stock and we effectively succeeded our otherwise minimal operations to those that are theirs, AHS is considered the accounting acquirer in this reverse-acquisition transaction. A reverse-acquisition transaction is considered, and accounted for as, a capital transaction in substance; it is equivalent to the issuance of AHS securities for our net monetary assets, which are deminimus, accompanied by a recapitalization. Accordingly, we have not recognized any goodwill or other intangible assets in connection with this reverse acquisition transaction. AHS is the surviving and continuing entities and the historical financials following the reverse acquisition transaction will be those of AHS.  We were a "shell company" (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) immediately prior to our acquisition of AHS pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement.  As a result of such acquisition, our operations now are focused on providing outsourced, customized international healthcare services to the rapidly changing health care industry primarily focused in the Peoples Republic of China. We are also pursuing the provision of these services in the United States as well as certain strategic partnerships and property ownership and management. AHS owns 100% of the capital stock of Avalon (Shanghai) Healthcare Technology Co., Ltd. (“Avalon Shanghai”), which is a wholly foreign-owned enterprise organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”). Avalon Shanghai was incorporated on April 29, 2016 and is engaged in medical related consulting services for customers. Consequently, we believe that acquisition has caused us to cease to be a shell company as we no longer have nominal operations.
 
On September 29, 2016, effective October 18, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate”) with the State of Delaware to (i) effect a reverse stock split of its outstanding and authorized shares of common stock at a ratio of 1 for 4 (the “Reverse Stock Split”) and (ii) effectuate a name change ("Name Change"). Fractional shares that resulted from the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the next highest number. As a result of the Name Change, the Company's name changed from "Global Technologies Corp." to "Avalon GloboCare Corp.". The Certificate was approved by the majority of the Company's shareholders and by the Board of Directors of the Company. The effective date of the Reverse Stock Split and the Name Change was October 18, 2016.

In connection with the above, the Company filed an Issuer Company-Related Action Notification Form with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Reverse Stock Split and the Name Change were implemented by FINRA on October 18, 2016. Our symbol on the OTCQB was GTHCD for 20 business days from October 18, 2016 (the “Notification Period”). Following the Notification Period, our symbol was changed to “AVCO”. Our new CUSIP number is 05344R 104.
