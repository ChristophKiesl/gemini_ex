ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
KULR Technology Group, Inc., through our wholly-owned subsidiary KULR Technology Corporation, develops and commercializes high-performance thermal management technologies for batteries, electronics, and other components across an array of battery-powered applications. For aerospace and Department of Defense (“DOD”) applications, our solutions target high performance applications in direct energy, hypersonic vehicles and satellite communications. For commercial applications, our main focus is a total solution to battery safety and sustainability by which we aim to mitigate the effects of thermal runaway propagation which has been known to cause random fires in lithium-ion (“Li-ion”) batteries. This total battery safety solution can be used for electric vehicles, energy storage, battery recycling transportation, cloud computing and 5G communication devices. Our proprietary core technology is a carbon fiber material that provides what we believe to be superior thermal conductivity and heat dissipation for an ultra-lightweight and pliable material. By leveraging our proprietary cooling solutions that have been developed through longstanding partnerships with advanced technology users like NASA, the Jet Propulsion Lab and others, our products and services make commercial battery powered products safer and electronics systems cooler and lighter.
 
KULR’s business model continues to evolve from being a component supplier, to providing more design and testing services to our customers. The next step of evolution is to provide total system solutions to address market needs. In order to scale up as a systems provider more quickly and efficiently in (i) the Li-ion battery energy storage and recycling markets, (ii) battery cell design and safety testing, and (iii) advanced thermal management systems, such as hypersonic vehicles, KULR will actively seek partners for joint venture, technology licensing and other strategic partnership models. The goal is to leverage the Company’s thermal design technology expertise to create market leading products, which KULR will take to market directly to capture more value for KULR shareholders.
 
Battery safety technology is becoming increasingly vital to our world in which battery-operated devices are everywhere. Li-ion batteries are widely used in consumer electronics, aerospace, marine and automotive applications. In recent months, KULR has developed a total battery safety solution for its customers that spans a wide array of industries and applications. KULR has seen great success in using our patented thermal runaway shield (“TRS”) technology to prevent cell to cell thermal runaway propagation as well as module to module propagation. We have designed a total solution for customers from the design stages incorporating our materials all the way to testing their passive propagation resistant (“PPR”) battery packs. We are flexible and can work with different battery pack configurations across various industries. We developed a PPR reference design for CubeSat battery in December 2019. Based on this reference design platform, we were awarded a dual-use technology development agreement from NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center to build 3D printed battery systems for manned and robotic space applications in August 2020. Our research and testing, as well as working alongside battery experts at NASA Johnson Space Center, has positioned us for further advancements at the forefront of battery safety.
 
Hundreds of millions of Li-ion cells are produced and transported annually and even those packaged to prevent external shorting can still experience thermal runaway (“TR”) due to internal shorts, caused by latent defects, when fully charged. In these dangerous cases, a torch-like fire is released as energy escapes from the cell and sends nearby cells into TR resulting in a large fire. As part of our total battery safety solution, we have designed a bag out of our TRS material to suppress the flames and prevent the TR event. Suitably placed, the TRS provides a means of protection not only from adjacent batteries but also outside fires of arbitrary origin. Experts at NASA’s Propulsion & Power Division found our TRS successful at extinguishing the fire generated by cells when they intentionally triggered the batteries into dangerous failures. Our TRS bag is currently being used on the International Space Station (“ISS”) through a project with Leidos, for storing laptop batteries in order to reduce the risk of TR. 
 
Another key element of our battery safety solution is KULR internal short circuit (“ISC”) device and trigger cells which are used for cell testing and screening. Our patented ISC device, licensed from NASA/NREL, can be inserted by OEMs or manufacturers into cells to mimic failure conditions in a cell. Once the trigger device is placed inside the cell, it can be intentionally triggered on demand causing the cell to short circuit. Currently, we provide ISC devices to OEMs and cell manufacturers, as well as ready-made ISC trigger cells to customers to identify failure modes and safety issues within their systems. Currently we are creating an ecosystem based on our technology which can be applied to different battery architectures and chemistries.
 
Our management believes that within commercial markets, aerospace and defense, and high-value applications, cell safety testing and screening has become a topic of focus. Therefore, we plan to expand our capabilities to include full battery analysis and testing as outlined by NASA Johnson Space Center. We plan to fully incorporate this into our holistic approach to battery safety along with our PPR battery pack design and testing services, ISC device and trigger cell products and TRS bags. With increasing regulations and pressure from government bodies to mitigate the dangers of battery fires and TR, we plan to further develop our capabilities in this arena.

Our management expects high growth in the aerospace and defense sectors, specifically in regards to hypersonic vehicle programs, space missions and directed energy programs. Thermal management is a critical component of both hypersonic weapons programs and space missions. Our carbon fiber solutions are used for thermal management in missile defense programs and are particularly effective because of their survivability at very high temperatures. They are also very effective at transferring heat and mitigate the risk of overheating in such high-risk environments. Historically we have provided value to this sector and we expect to further develop our relationships with the Airforce Research Lab, the Naval Research Lab and prime contractors to market our solutions. Directed energy is currently in the spotlight as experts predict it will greatly impact the future of national security. Our CRUX cathode generates powerful electron pulses by field emission from the tops of our carbon fiber coating and has the potential to further develop the current technology.
 
In addition to evolving demands led by aerospace and defense, we have observed trending manufacturer-led opportunities in industries such as electric motor vehicles (“EV”) that have become increasingly more reliant on the Cloud, portability and high-demand processing power. KULR’s high performance thermal interface materials can be used to accelerate 5G communications development due to our material’s core properties: high thermal conductivity, light weight, and low contact pressure. 5G is one of the biggest opportunities going forward for transportation technology and we plan to take part in testing of digital and RF tests for 5G. Testing is still in early phases for both digital and RF communication chips, however, we are seeing a big growth opportunity for thermal management for 5G. Cloud computing is also an application of interest since high power communications chips and optical communication modules require cooling.
 
We have not yet achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur cash outflows from operations, as a result, we will eventually need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability. Until that time we shall have to continue to raise cash as and when required through the sale of stock.
 
Corporate 
 
KULR was incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 2015 and was formerly known as “KT High-Tech Marketing, Inc.” and, prior to that, as “Grant Hill Acquisition Corporation.” In April 2016, KULR implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new shareholders, redeeming shares of existing shareholders, electing new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, KULR Technology Corp, was formed in 2013 and is based in San Diego California. Since its inception, KTC primarily focused on developing and commercializing its thermal management technologies, which it acquired through assignment from and license with KTC’s co-founder Dr. Timothy Knowles. Prior to 2013, KTC’s technologies were used in numerous advanced space and industrial applications for NASA, Boeing, and Raytheon. A few notable achievements were the use of KTC’s technologies in the X-31 aircraft (battery heat sink), Mercury Messenger (battery heat sink), and X-51 Scramjet (heat exchanger).
 
On June 19, 2017, KULR closed a share exchange with KTC and 100% of the shareholders of KTC (the “KTC Shareholders”) whereby the KTC Shareholders agreed to transfer an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of KTC’s common stock to KULR in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 50,000,000 shares of KULR’s common stock to the KTC Shareholders (the “Share Exchange”), resulting in KTC becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of KULR and KTC’s business of developing and commercializing its thermal management technologies becoming KULR’s main operation.
 
The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, with KTC being treated as the acquiring company for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the financial statements included in this Annual Report reflect the assets, liabilities and historical results of KTC prior to the completion of the Share Exchange.
 
On August 30, 2018, KULR changed its name from “KT High-Tech Marketing, Inc.” to “KULR Technology Group, Inc.” by filing a certificate of amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. 
 
On December 4, 2018, KULR filed a definitive Information Statement on Form 14C (the “December Information Statement”), giving notice to KULR’s shareholders that on November 5, 2018, KUTG executed a written consent in lieu of shareholder meeting authorizing KULR to: (i) amend KULR’s Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 100,000,000 shares of common stock to 500,000,000 shares of common stock; (ii) adopt and ratify the KULR Technology Group 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and (iii) ratify the authorization of the issuance of 1,000,000 shares (the “Voting Preferred Shares”) of Series A Voting Preferred Stock to Michael Mo, KULR’s Chief Executive Officer. On December 28, 2018, twenty (20) days after the mailing date of the December Information Statement, KUTG was deemed authorized by ratifying vote of its majority shareholders and the authorization granted by its Board of Directors to issue the Voting Preferred Shares, which KULR has not but expects to do in the near future. On December 31, 2018, KULR filed a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, to increase the number of authorized shares of its common stock from 100,000,000 to 500,000,000. As a result, the aggregate number of the Company’s authorized capital stock became 520,000,000 shares.

Recent Developments
 
COVID-19
 
In January 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. Through the first quarter of 2020, the disease became widespread around the world, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. Our business is dependent on developing new markets and new products to be used on a global basis, thus restrictions on travel could lead to reduced demand for our products and interruptions to supply chains. Also, the local regulations such as “Shelter in Place” will affect our ability to maintain regular R&D and manufacturing schedules as well as the capability to meet customer demands in a timely manner. Given the uncertainty around the extent and timing of the potential future spread or mitigation of the Coronavirus and around the imposition or relaxation of protective measures, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact to our future results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.
Standby Equity Distribution Agreement and Notes Payable
 
On February 27, 2020, we entered into a Standby Equity Distribution Agreement (“SEDA”) with YAII PN, Ltd., a Cayman Island exempt limited partnership (“YAII”). Under the terms of this Agreement, the Company raised an aggregate of $2,292,695 from the facility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $5,707,000 available in connection with the SEDA, however, so long as warrants issued on December 31, 2020 in an unrelated transaction remain outstanding, the Company may not issue shares in connection with variable rate transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued notes to YAII in the aggregate amount of $4,000,000, of which the Company repaid principal on the notes in the aggregate amount of $1,550,000 ($791,000 was repaid from proceeds from the SEDA). Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company repaid principal on the notes in the aggregate amount of $1,050,000.

According to Market Research Future, the global thermal management market is expected to reach approximately $15 billion by end of 2023 with 7% compound annual growth rate during the forecast period from 2017 to 2023. According to the report, in recent years, electronic devices and systems have undergone tremendous technological growth. Advancements in the electronics industry have led to an increased need for innovative thermal management technologies, which serve to improve performance and reliability. The report states that technological progress has come on two fronts: increased functionality on a single device unit and miniaturization of each unit. As a result, there has been an increased demand for thermal management technologies. The report analyzes the thermal market by four segments, including hardware, software, interfaces, and substrates.
 
Electrical Transportation Market. According to Frost & Sullivan’s recently released “Global Electric Vehicle Market Outlook EV industry will need to overcome major challenges related to battery technology and charging infrastructure, both of which have fallen far short of the pace set by global EV sales.
5G Mobile Computing Market. The next generation mobile computing platform, also known as the “5G” mobile wireless standard, presents new challenges and demands to improve the performance and reliability of mobile infrastructures and consumer devices. According to the IHS Markit’s global study, in 2035, when 5G’s full economic benefit should be realized across the globe, a broad range of industries – from retail to education, transportation to entertainment, and everything in between – could produce up to $12.3 trillion worth of goods and services enabled by 5G.
Cloud Computing Market. A key area of cloud computing is optical data transfer and communications connections and lines. Optical data is faster and more efficient and, as cloud computing banks move to acquire and utilize optical data, thermal management will play a pivotal role in maintaining the peak performance and safety of these expensive and highly sensitive computer connections. The processing demands of artificial intelligence (“AI”) technology in the cloud requires advanced thermal management solutions for processors and memory modules.
 
Space Exploration and Communications Market.

Intellectual Property and Patent Strategy 
 
Our intellectual property strategy includes pursuing patent protection for new innovations in core carbon fiber architecture development, application development, acquisition of intellectual property, and licensing of third-party patents and intellectual property. As of December 31, 2020, we have eight pending nonprovisional and provisional patent applications and we have four patents granted and assigned to KULR. We also have an exclusive license to four third party patents. 
Product and Services
 
Our heat management products and services can be divided into the following categories, subcategories and functionalities:
 
Lithium-Ion Battery Thermal Runaway Shield (“TRS”): KULR has developed a thermal insulation technology aimed at passive resistance to thermal runaway propagation in Li-ion batteries in partnership with National Aeronautics and Space Administration Johnson Space Center (“NASA JSC”). HYDRA TRS acts as a heat sink during normal Li-ion battery pack operation but also prevents thermal runaway propagation, which is a serious concern for aerospace and defense customers and electric vehicle manufacturers. The HYDRA is a vaporizing thermal capacitor that provides passive prevention of thermal runaway propagation (“TRP”) in Li-ion battery packs. Thermal runaway can occur spontaneously in a Li-ion cell due to a short. This can trigger an explosive release of electric energy that ruptures the end cap resulting in a flare and combustion of cell materials. Released heat drives the triggered cell temperatures to > 500°C, causing a dramatic increase in neighboring cell temperatures. Temperatures above the critical 130°C greatly increases the chance for a short in adjacent cells and result in TRP. TRS keeps neighboring cell temperatures from rising above 100°C (well below the 130°C threshold) and prevents TRP.
Fiber Thermal Interface Material (“FTI”): KULR thermal interface materials (“TIMs”) consist of vertically oriented carbon fiber velvets attached to a film of polymer or metal. The fiber packing density and orientation are selected to serve a wide range of applications, including hostile thermal and chemical environments, sliding interfaces, and interfaces with widely varying gaps. They can be coated for electrical isolation. They require low contact pressure and provide high thermal conductivity. Their light weight and high compliance make them uniquely suited for aerospace, industrial and high-performance commercial devices.
Phase Change Material (“PCM”) Heat Sink: KULR PCM composite heat sinks consisting of a conductive carbon fiber velvet embedded with a suitable alkane (“paraffin”) having high latent heat at its melting point. Such heat sinks offer passive thermal control for instruments that would otherwise overheat or under-cool during periodic operations. A typical application involves lasers that dissipate heat but need tight thermal control where active cooling is unavailable.
 
HYDRA TRS Battery Storage Bag: KULR developed the HYDRA TRS Bag to safely store and transport Li-ion batteries in partnership with NASA Johnson Space Center for the International Space Stations. Between January and June 2019 experts with NASA’s Propulsion & Power Division tested storage and use of rechargeable lithium-ion laptop batteries. The tests intentionally triggered the batteries into dangerous failures in order to study what storage methods may stop battery fires from spreading battery to battery in thermal runaway propagation. As a result, KULR TRS bags are currently in service on the International Space Station for storage of spare laptop batteries, having flown November 2, 2019 on the CRS2 NG-12 resupply mission. KULR is developing a commercial version for mass market applications.
 
Internal Short Circuit (“ISC”) Device: In March 2018, KULR reached an agreement with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (“NREL”), a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy, to be the exclusive manufacturing and distribution partner for the patented ISC device, which causes predictable battery cell failures in Li-ion batteries, making them easier to study and, therefore, safer. Li-ion batteries are the industry and consumer standard for portable power; billions of individual battery cells exist and billions more are planned for production. They provide power for everything from smart phones and laptops to electric cars and space crafts. But Li-ion batteries fail, sometimes with catastrophic results. Due to the relative rarity of cell failures, scientists and researchers had been unable to reliably or accurately replicate latent defect cell failures in lab settings, impeding research into safer battery technology. In 2020, KULR has produced and sold both ISC devices and ISC trigger cells to customers.
 
CRUX Cathode: The CRUX Cathode is composed of a carbon fiber velvet, providing a means of generating powerful electron pulses by field emission from the tops of the carbon fibers. CRUX Cathodes can be customized for different applications including the generation of microwaves, x-rays, and laser radiation. They can be fabricated in a wide variety of physical configurations, ranging from simple planar and cylindrical forms to more complex lobed shapes.

Competition
 
Currently, the battery industry uses a number of solutions to mitigate thermal runaway propagation that are offered by Unifrax, Lydall, LHS, 3M, Engineered Syntactic Systems, Celono, AllCell and others. Each of their solutions offer unique features and benefits for a specific application. We do not believe, however, that there is a one-size-fits-all solution across all applications. We believe our PPR design solution offers competitive light-weight and effective solutions for high energy battery cells because it is more flexible and can fit into different design configurations. For applications that require passive, light-weight solutions for high energy density battery cells, TRS offers a competitive solution.
 
Thermal interface material is a large and fragmented market with many large suppliers including: Henkel Bergquist, Fujipoly, Laird, 3M, Honeywell and others. These solutions are typically based on silicone and thermal particles. KULR’s FTI offers high bulk thermal conductivity and low contact pressure requirements, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over other thermal interface solutions.
 
Our licensed ISC device offers a reliable way to trigger battery cell thermal runaway compared to nail penetration, over-charging or over-heating the cell. ISC does not rely on mechanically damaging the battery exterior to activate the short, as do most of the other evaluation methodologies. Instead, the ISC devices trigger true internal shorts. This makes it possible to accurately pinpoint and fix problems leading to malfunctions, an ability that we believe will give us a competitive advantage over other testing solutions.
 
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Compliance
 
Certain substances we use in our manufacturing process are subject to federal governmental regulations (such as Environmental Protect Agency regulations). We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable governmental regulations, and that the cost and effect of compliance with environmental laws is not material. As a small generator of hazardous substances, we are subject to local governmental regulations relating to the storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances, such as acetone that is used in very small quantities to manufacture our products. We are currently in compliance with these regulations. Most new materials sold in the U.S or in many other countries require regulation by government authorities. In most other countries, there are no specific regulations that require additional regulation, but some countries do have registration requirements with which we comply to the best our ability.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 9 employees and 4 consultants. We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees and we have not experienced any significant labor disputes.
Intellectual Property 
 
We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyright, trademarks and trade secrets. We have, and will continue to, file applications for and/or obtain patents, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by implementing organizational nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. As of December 31, 2020, we held four U.S. patents and eight non-provisional pending U.S. patent applications with expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2035. In addition, KULR has exclusive license on four patents from its partnerships. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. While our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets provide some advantage and protection, we believe our competitive position and future success is largely determined by such factors as the system and application knowledge, innovative skills, technological expertise and management ability and experience of our personnel; the range and success of new products being developed by us; our market brand recognition and ongoing marketing efforts; and customer service and technical support. We also have trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business to distinguish genuine KULR products; KULR has been granted trademarks for Class 9 and Class 17 applications.
