AWLD’s Concept and Business: Repositioning of Hotel Properties, Luxury Destinations and Residential Properties
 
AWLD, through IPG, focuses on opportunities that create value through repositioning of underperforming hotel and commercial assets such as hotel/residential/retail destinations. Repositioning means we are working to gradually increment our average fares to solidify our position as a luxury option. This trend has been well received in large metropolitan areas which have become quite competitive. We believe that the trend is now trickling down to secondary metropolitan, resort and foreign markets where there is significantly less competition from the established major operators. We continue to seek opportunities where value can be added through re-capitalization, repositioning, expansion, improved marketing and/or professional management. We believe that AWLD can increase demand for all of a property’s various offerings, from its rooms, to its dining, meeting and entertainment facilities, to its retail establishments through careful branding and positioning of properties. While the maxim remains true that the three most important factors in real estate are “location, location, location,” management believes that “style and superior service” have grown in importance and can lead to increased operating revenues and capital appreciation.
 
We are currently increasing our activity, occupancy and presence in the market by using direct marketing actions (FB, Trip Advisor, Relais & Chateau chains, internet presence), and expanding our net of travel agencies and operators, introducing effective changes in our direct sales capacity (new sales-oriented webpages, joint ventures with other hotel organizations, training of our reservations employees, implementing new reservation software). We have also reached out to travel industry media operators to develop new strategic relationships and we are implementing a new commercial management operation for a more aggressive approach with a sales-oriented objective. AWLD has built a team of industry professionals to assist in implementing its vision toward repositioning real estate assets. See “Item 10 Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”
 
Plan of Operations
 
AWLD continues to implement its growth and development strategy that includes a luxury boutique hotel, a resort estate, vineyard and winery, and a large land development project including residential houses within the vineyard. See “Algodon Wine Estates” below.
Long Term Growth Strategy
 
One of AWLD’s goals include positioning its brand ALGODON® as one of luxury. We continue to form strategic alliances with well-established luxury brands that have strong followings to create awareness of the Algodon brand and help build customer loyalty. To date, Algodon has been associated and co-branded with several world-class luxury brands including Relais & Châteaux, Veuve Clicquot Champagne (owned by Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy), Davidoff Cigars, and L’Occitane.
 
The Company hopes to continue to self-finance future acquisition and development projects because in countries like Argentina, having cash available to purchase land and other assets provides an advantage to buyers. Bank financing in such countries is often difficult or impossible to obtain. To be able to grow our business and expand into new projects, the Company would first want to deploy excess cash generated by operations, but significant amounts of excess cash flow is not anticipated for at least a number of years. Another option would be obtaining new investment funds from investors, including a possible public offering, and/or borrowing from institutional lenders. AWLD may also be able to acquire property for stock instead of cash.
 
The ALGODON® Brand
 
We believe that the force and power of brand is of paramount importance in the luxury real estate/hotel market. AWLD has developed the ALGODON® brand, one of distinction, refinement and elegance. Inspired by both the Cotton Club days of the Roaring 20’s and the distinctive style and glamour of the 50’s Rat Pack when travel and leisure was synonymous with cultural sophistication, this brand concept was taken from the Spanish word for “cotton.” ALGODON® connotes a clean and pure appreciation for the good life, a sense of refined culture, and ultimately a destination where the best elements of the illustrious past meet the affluent present. AWLD is looking to attract attention and upscale demographic visitors to the ALGODON® properties and to round out the brand experience in various other forms including music, dining, wine, sports and apparel, by marketing themes that highlight active lifestyles and the pleasures of life. Management believes that these types of brand extensions will serve to reinforce the overall brand recognition and further build upon AWLD’s core presence in the luxury hotel segment.

Description of Specific Investment Projects
 
AWLD has invested in two ALGODON® brand properties located in Argentina. The first property is Algodon Mansion, a Buenos Aires-based luxury boutique hotel that opened in 2010 and is held in IPG’s subsidiary, The Algodon – Recoleta S.R.L. (“TAR”). The second property, held by Algodon Wine Estates S.R.L., is a Mendoza-based winery and golf resort called Algodon Wine Estates, which was subdivided for residential development, and expanded by acquiring adjoining wine producing properties.
Algodon Mansion
 

The Company, through TAR, has renovated a hotel in the Recoleta section of Buenos Aires called Algodon Mansion, a stately six-story mansion (including roof-top facilities and basement) located at 1647 Montevideo Street, a tree-lined street in Recoleta, one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Buenos Aires. The property is approximately 20,000 square feet and is a ten-suite premium-luxury hotel with a restaurant (seating approximately 62), a wine bar (seating approximately 20), a private dining room (seating approximately 16) and a rooftop that houses a luxury spa, terrace pool, and chic open-air cigar bar and lounge. Each guest room is an ultra-luxury two-to-three room suite, each approximately 510-1,200 square feet. Recoleta is Buenos Aires’ embassy and luxury hotel district and has fashionable boutiques, high-end restaurants, cafés, art galleries, and opulent belle époque architecture. In 2016, the Algodon Mansion hotel received an international award of excellence from TripExpert, and was awarded 8th place in the ‘Top 20 International Hideaway’ category for Andrew Harper’s 2016 Readers’ Choice Awards.
 

In November 2011, it was announced that Relais & Châteaux, the renowned fellowship of the world’s finest hotels and restaurants, extended membership to Algodon Mansion hotel. Having reached the highest standards of service required by Relais & Châteaux only a year after celebrating its grand openings, Algodon Mansion is the first Relais & Châteaux hotel in Buenos Aires to be awarded this distinction. As of March 15, 2017, Relais & Châteaux’s global fellowship of individually owned and operated luxury hotels and restaurants has nearly 530 members in 64 countries on six continents.
 

Algodon Club, the restaurant on the main floor of Algodon Mansion, offers a sophisticated menu emphasizing Argentinian-style cuisine. The dining room comfortably seats 62 persons and offers a seasonal menu, serving ingredients acquired locally and from the plantation at Algodon Wine Estates in San Rafael, Mendoza. Algodon products include estate cultivated extra virgin olive oil, fresh fruits and vegetables, cheeses, smoked meats, and homemade breads to exemplify the restaurant’s wholesome, farm-to-table daily fare. Algodon Club’s menu complements the wines and local products of Argentina’s wine region and includes Algodon’s own premium and icon wines. We own and manage the food and beverage operations (restaurant, events, catering) at Algodon Club.

Algodon Wine Bar, located in the Algodon Mansion lobby, offers a unique wine list that exemplifies the Argentinean wine portfolio, with emphasis on the premium and icon vintages of Algodon’s own private collection from Algodon Wine Estates in Mendoza.
 

Algodon Mansion’s rooftop pool features teak decks and loungers that invite afternoon tanning in the summer sun. An open-air bar and tented cigar lounge, the “Davidoff Lounge,” in association with the world-renowned Davidoff Cigars, features a menu of drinks from around the world, and is well suited for twilight soirées, rooftop parties and late night cocktail events. Also on the rooftop is Le Spa, which features steam, sauna, and massage rooms as well as relaxation areas where guests may be pampered in a calm and tranquil atmosphere and indulge in a variety of treatment options. Le Spa at Algodon Mansion combines natural elements of Argentina’s native regions with the latest treatments and technology from Europe’s finest spas. Le Spa’s licensed medical specialists help to design customized holistic treatments for each individual with an emphasis on organic, non-invasive and non-aggressive products for the face and body.
 
Algodon Wine Estates
 

In July 2007, Algodon Wine Estates S.R.L. (“AWE”) acquired 718 acres located in the Cuadro Benegas district of San Rafael, Mendoza. Subsequently, in 2007 and 2008, AWE purchased additional land adjacent to the original 718-acre property, culminating in a 2,050 acre area to be known as Algodon Wine Estates. The resort property is part of the Mendoza wine region nestled in the foothills of the Andes mountain range. This property includes a winery (whose vines date back to the mid-1940’s), a newly-expanded 18-hole golf course, tennis, restaurant and hotel. The estate is situated on Mendoza’s Ruta del Vino (Wine Trail). The 2,050-acre property has an impressive lineage, both in terms of wine production and golf, and features structures on the property that date back to 1921.
 
Algodon Wine Estates features Algodon Villa, a private lodge originally built in 1921 that has been fully restored and refurbished to its original farmhouse design of adobe walls and cane roof. The lodge offers three suites, a gallery for private gatherings, a living area that may also serve as a dining and conference room, swimming pool, and adjacent vine-covered picnic area. The Algodon Villa offers five-star service and is situated for vacationing families, business conferences, retreat travelers, golfing companions, or wine route globe trekkers. Algodon Wine Estates has also recently completed the construction of a new lodge which lies adjacent to the original one. The new lodge features six additional suites and a gallery with two fireplaces and a bar.
 
Algodon Wine Estates completed the expansion of its nine-hole golf course to 18 holes during 2013, including irrigation canals and ponds. Adjacent to the course is a clubhouse, pro shop, driving range, and award winning restaurant and the Tennis Center.

Algodon Wines
 
Algodon Wine Estates contains a vineyard with 310 acres of vines. Over 60 acres have been cultivated since the 1940’s, and approximately 20 acres since the 1960’s. The property produces eight varieties of grapes, including Argentina’s signature varietal, Malbec, as well as Bonarda, Cabernet Sauvingnon, Merlot, Syrah, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Semillon. The primary difference between the old and new vines is the style of pruning. Algodon Wine Estates utilizes a boutique wine making process, typified by production of a low volume of premium wines sold at a higher than average price in the market.
 
In March 2014, Algodon Wine Estates acquired its own bottling machine in order to improve the winery’s production capacity. This bottling machine allows our winemakers to bottle when desired and when necessary, rather than depending on the availability of external bottling facilities. In April 2014, new stainless steel wine tanks were added to the winery, increasing storage capacity by 55,000 liters. This includes five 5,000 liter tanks and three 10,000 liter tanks. These upgrades have significantly increased our production capacity. During the production year of 2016, we produced over 100,000 liters, which would translate roughly to about 120,000 bottles or 10,000 cases, representing a production increase of 81% over the prior year’s production. Despite our increased production capacity, production during 2015 was negatively affected by a significant hailstorm. During 2015, we produced 55,000 liters, which translates to about 73,000 bottles or 6,000 cases of wine.
 
In an effort to increase distribution of its wines, Algodon Wine Estates is working with a number of importers operating in some of the world’s chief markets for premium wines. In Toronto, Canada, BND Wines & Spirits (www.bndwines.com) represents Algodon Wines. In Europe, Algodon Wine Estates warehouses its wines in Amsterdam for central distribution to clients in Germany and in the U.K. through Condor Wines (www.condorwines.co.uk), which works with regional distribution partners throughout the U.K. such as hotel and restaurant chains, regional and national brewers, pub companies, wholesalers and wine merchants. In Brazil, Algodon has entered the competitive Sao Paulo market in cooperation with www.lupin.com.br andwww.initiumworldwide.com, and believes this may result in a significantly improved presence of Algodon wines in the Brazilian market. In the United States, Algodon Fine Wines will soon be available for sale online at Sherry-Lehmann.com (which ships to 39 states), and at Sherry-Lehmann’s iconic retail store in New York City.
 
Through December 2015, Jomada Imports, LLC (www.jomadaimports.com) (“Jomada”), with its principal location at 500 Capital Drive, Lake Zurich, IL 60047 was the authorized importer of wines to the U.S. bearing the name Algodon Wine Estates; San Rafael, Argentina and was authorized to import wine under Federal Basic Permit IL-I-15170. The Company’s agreement with Jomada was terminated effective January 8, 2016. On June 1, 2016, the Company executed an import and distribution agreement with Seaview Imports, with its principal location is at 48 Harbor Park Drive, Suite D, Port Washington, NY 10150.
 
None of the understandings with wine importers constitute a binding commitment by either party to produce, import or export the Company’s wines; performance by any of the parties is dependent upon numerous factors such as economic and political climate, consumer spending, weather, the Company’s ability to continue wine production operations, the market acceptance of the Company’s products, and other matters described in the Item 1A - Risk Factors.
 
AWE uses microvinification (barrel fermentation) for its premium varietals and blends. Microvinification is commonly used in France, but is uncommon in Argentina, and Algodon Wine Estates is one of the few wineries in the country to implement this specialized process.
 
James Galtieri holds the title of Senior Wine Advisor on Algodon’s Advisory Board. James is a founding partner and former President/CEO of Pasternak Wine Imports, a renowned national wine importer and distributor, founded in 1988 in partnership with Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite). He currently maintains an advisory role to Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite), and he is the current President/CEO at Seaview Imports LLC., a national wine importer (based in New York) covering the U.S. market with high-quality, exclusive wine brands. James has considerable background and experience in wine knowledge and wine market dynamics, and he is specialized in corporate management in the wine & spirit industry.

Algodon Wine Estates launched its ultra-premium wine under the “PIMA” brand in November 2012. PIMA by Algodon is a single vineyard wine that has been crafted from the finest handpicked grapes of Algodon’s 1946 Malbec and 1946 Bonarda vineyards utilizing microvinification (barrel fermentation) process from day one of harvest. PIMA wine is a limited collection which currently retails for approximately $100 per bottle. Most recently, Algodon Wine’s 2010 Bonarda ranked among the World Association of Wine & Spirit Writers’ and Journalists’ (WAWWJ®) Top 100 Wines of the World 2014. In 2016 Algodon’s Black Label Malbec was awarded a gold medal in the Global Malbec Masters 2016 Wine Competition
 
Algodon Wine Estates – Real Estate Development
 
AWE has acquired a substantial amount of contiguous real estate surrounding its project in Mendoza, Argentina. This land was purchased with the purpose of developing a vineyard-resort and attracting investment in second or third homes for the well-to-do from around the world. AWLD continues to invest in the ongoing costs of building out infrastructure and anticipates that sales of lots will gradually improve and accelerate as worldwide economic conditions improve.
 
AWLD is currently marketing portions of the property to be developed into luxury residential homes and vineyard estates. Management believes that the power of the ALGODON ® brand combined with an attractive package of amenities will promote interest in the surrounding real estate. The estate’s master plan features a luxury golf and vineyard living community, made up of six distinct village sectors, with 610 home sites ranging in size from 0.2 to 2.8 hectares (0.5 to 7 acres) for private sale and development. The development’s village sectors have been designed and named in accordance with their characteristic surroundings and landscape: the Wine & Golf Village, the Polo & Equestrian Village, the Sierra Pintada Village, The North Vineyard & Orchard Village, The South Vineyard & Orchard Village, and the Desert Vista Village. The development is located fifteen minutes from both the local airport and city center.
 
Ginevra Sotheby’s International Realty provides sales representation for AWLD’s residential development. Ginevra Sotheby’s International Realty is a leading luxury real estate firm in Buenos Aires, Argentina with listings in the most prestigious neighborhoods in the city of Buenos Aires and the rest of the country. Through Ginevra Sotheby’s International Realty’s website (ginevrasir.com), Algodon Wine Estates listings will be marketed on the sothebysrealty.com, to a global clientele.
 
Currently, AWLD is developing lots for sale to third party builders and is not engaged in any construction activity. To date, twenty-one lots have been sold, and the Company expects to close on the sale of these lots and record the deeds during 2017. Revenue is recorded when the deeds are issued. To date, no deeds have been issued. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has $1,652,180 of lot deposits for pending sales.
