Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering a precision medicine approach to the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapeutic products for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, starting first with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We leverage our proprietary precision medicine platform, Prometheus360, which includes one of the world’s largest gastrointestinal (GI) bioinformatics databases and sample biobanks, to identify novel therapeutic targets, develop therapeutic candidates to engage those targets, and develop genetics-based diagnostic tests designed to identify patients more likely to respond to our therapeutic candidates. We have generated a robust pipeline of therapeutic development programs for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases.
 Our lead product candidate, PRA023, is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has been shown to block the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like ligand 1A (TL1A), a target associated with both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis. We believe PRA023’s dual mechanism of action, targeting both inflammation and fibrosis, also provides a strong rationale for advancing PRA023 into clinical trials for indications beyond IBD.
 In July 2021, we initiated ARTEMIS-UC, a global Phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of PRA023 in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC), and APOLLO-CD, a global Phase 2a open-label clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease (CD), each utilizing our genetics-based diagnostic candidate designed to identify patients who are predisposed to increased expression of TL1A and therefore potentially more likely to respond to PRA023.
In December 2022, we reported topline results from the initial cohort of ARTEMIS-UC (Cohort 1) and results from APOLLO-CD demonstrating strong efficacy and favorable safety results in both studies. We believe these results position PRA023 to be a potential first-in-class and best-in-class treatment for patients suffering from UC and CD.
In our ARTEMIS-UC Phase 2a study, the topline results for the key endpoints and safety were as follows:
 •26.5% of patients on PRA023 reached the primary endpoint of clinical remission (per modified Mayo Score), compared to 1.5% on placebo, for a placebo-adjusted clinical remission rate of 25.0% on the primary endpoint (p<0.0001);
 •36.8% of patients on PRA023 reached the secondary endpoint of endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy subscore of ≤ 1), compared to 6.0% on placebo, for a placebo-adjusted endoscopic improvement rate of 30.8% on the secondary endpoint (p<0.0001); and
 •PRA023 was well tolerated, with no treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation, severe AEs, opportunistic infections or infusion reactions reported. 
 In our APOLLO-CD Phase 2 study, the results for the key endpoints and safety were as follows:
 •26.0% of patients on PRA023 achieved endoscopic response (p=0.002 compared to 12% prespecified historical placebo rate);
 •49.1% of patients on PRA023 achieved clinical remission (p<0.001 compared to 16% prespecified historical placebo rate); and
 •PRA023 was well tolerated, with no treatment-emergent SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, or severe AEs, in each case, assessed as related to PRA023 by the investigator.
 We plan to advance PRA023 into Phase 3 studies for UC and CD in 2023 after we meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other foreign regulatory authorities and finalize our Phase 3 clinical trial strategy. The expansion cohort of ARTEMIS-UC (Cohort 2) is designed to further assess the treatment effect of PRA023 in patients who test positive on our diagnostic candidate, and we expect topline results in the second quarter of 2023.
 Beyond IBD, in March 2022 we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial for PRA023 in Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease (SSc-ILD). The FDA has granted fast track designation for PRA023 for the treatment of SSc-ILD. Topline results from our Phase 2 trial of PRA023 in Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease (ATHENA-SSc-ILD) are expected in the first half of 2024.


We are evaluating potentially advancing PRA023 into clinical trials for other indications where there is a strong mechanistic rational and high unmet need, and plan to announce our fourth potential indication for PRA023 in 2023.
 Inflammatory Bowel Disease
IBD is a complex disease with many contributing factors, including genetic, environmental and immunologic. UC and CD are two of the most common forms of IBD. Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the GI tract that begin most commonly during adolescence and young adulthood. UC involves the innermost lining of the large intestine, and symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea, frequently with blood and mucus. CD can affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall and all parts of the GI tract from mouth to anus. CD symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and other more systemic symptoms such as weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, and fever.
Current therapies used for the treatment of UC and CD apply a one-size-fits-all approach without regard to biologic variations amongst patients, and substantial unmet need remains. The current standard of care for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe IBD is typically anti-inflammatory agents; however, none of these therapies address fibrosis, or scarring, in IBD. The majority of IBD patients do not respond to first-line anti-TNF agents. Since the approval of the first anti-TNF agent for the treatment of CD in 1998, the availability of JAK inhibitors and newer biological agents, including anti-integrin and anti-IL12/23, has improved the care of moderate-to-severe IBD (JAK inhibitors in UC only). However, these subsequently approved therapies have generally failed to demonstrate a clinical remission effect size of more than 15% relative to placebo. Moreover, among those patients who do respond to therapy, up to 45% will lose response over time. Likewise, therapies under development have not demonstrated improved remission rates over previously approved therapies. In addition, in late 2021, the FDA issued a black box warning to the JAK drug class with indication for the treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, based on an increased risk of serious heart-related events such as heart attack or stroke, cancer, blood clots, and death.
IBD is estimated to affect over 2,000,000 people in the United States and over 5,000,000 people globally. The IBD market is approximately $18 billion globally and is estimated to grow to approximately $49 billion globally by 2030. The IBD market is highly concentrated, with four therapeutic products accounting for 75% of global revenues.
 Our Precision Medicine Approach
Precision medicine involves the discovery and development of therapies that integrate clinical and molecular information based on the biological basis of disease to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. We are pioneering the application of precision medicine in IBD and other immune-mediated diseases because we believe that by leveraging Prometheus360 we can identify novel therapeutic targets impacting the underlying pathways involved in IBD and the patient subgroups that may be more responsive to a particular therapy and then explore the utility of these therapies in other immune-mediated diseases where the same pathways are implicated.

We believe we have the potential to transform the entire IBD pharmaceutical value chain from discovery to commercialization with our precision medicine approach. Our Prometheus360 platform includes our extensive clinical database and associated biobank, which is one of the world’s largest collections of biospecimens from patients suffering from IBD and other GI disorders. This database and biobank, which we exclusively license from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (Cedars-Sinai), includes more than 200,000 samples linked to extensive clinical data from over 20,000 patients collected over more than 20 years. This, in combination with our state-of-the-art machine-learning methodologies, make Prometheus360 a discovery engine for novel precision therapeutics and diagnostics.

We believe our precision medicine approach will result in a greater likelihood of identifying and developing the right drug for the right patient, help to maximize patient and trial outcomes, improve label claims, accelerate adoption of targeted therapeutics for addressable patients and provide attractive treatment options from a cost-benefit perspective for payors.


Our Portfolio
We have a robust pipeline of clinical-stage product candidates and preclinical therapeutic development programs and plan to develop a diagnostic for each program to identify patients more likely to respond to drug. The following table summarizes our key current internal and partnered programs.

PRA023—anti-TL1A mAb
Our lead product candidate, PRA023, is a humanized IgG1 mAb that has been shown to bind and neutralize both the active trimeric form and inactive monomeric form of TL1A. We are developing PRA023 for the treatment of UC, CD and SSc-ILD. We believe PRA023’s dual mechanism of action, targeting both inflammation and fibrosis, also provides a strong rationale for advancing PRA023 into clinical trials for indications beyond IBD.
In December 2022, we reported topline results from Cohort 1 and results from APOLLO-CD demonstrating strong efficacy and favorable safety results in both studies. We plan to advance PRA023 into Phase 3 studies for UC and CD in 2023 after we meet with the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities and finalize our Phase 3 clinical trial strategy. Cohort 2 is designed to further assess the treatment effect of PRA023 in patients who test positive on our diagnostic candidate, and we expect results in the second quarter of 2023.
 In March 2022, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial for PRA023 in SSc-ILD. The FDA has granted fast track designation for PRA023 for the treatment of SSc-ILD. Topline results from ATHENA-SSc-ILD are expected in the first half of 2024.
 PRA052—anti-CD30L mAb
 Our second product candidate, PRA052, is an anti-CD30L mAb. The CD30L-CD30 co-stimulatory pathway has been implicated in IBD by genetic, preclinical, and human translational data. In preclinical studies, CD30L antagonism was observed to improve multiple animal models of colitis. PRA052 is designed to have high affinity and specificity for CD30L and to block both transmembrane and soluble CD30L. We filed an investigational new drug application (IND) for PRA052 in the third quarter of 2022 and then initiated a Phase 1 single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers in the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect topline results from the Phase 1 study in the fourth quarter of 2023. We are also developing a proprietary genetics-based diagnostic test for PRA052 to identify patients that are more likely to respond to CD30L inhibition.
 In 2020, we entered into a co-development and manufacturing agreement with Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH (Falk) for PRA052, in order to leverage Falk’s experience in GI drug development and commercialization in Europe. Under this agreement, we granted to Falk exclusive commercialization rights in Europe, Australia and New Zealand for PRA052 and its corresponding diagnostic candidate, while we retained commercialization rights in the United States and the rest of the world. In 2021, we earned both preclinical milestone payments from Falk related to our selection of the PRA052 clinical candidate and our development of a diagnostic candidate for PRA052.
 PR1100—Anti-cytokine receptor mAb
 Our PR1100 program targets the receptor for a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been linked to multiple immune-mediated diseases. In particular, the pathway modulated by our target has been associated, both functionally, and genetically with IBD, highlighting a

possible role in the pathogenesis of this disease. We have identified SNPs in the gene locus of this target that are associated with IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases. We expect to submit an IND for our PR1100 therapeutic candidate in the fourth quarter of 2023.
 PR2100—anti-Inflammatory Cytokine mAb
 Our PR2100 program targets a cytokine implicated in a range of inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. In IBD specifically, this cytokine has been implicated to contribute to non-response to anti-TNF therapies. We have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene locus of this target that are associated with IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases. We expect to submit an IND for our PR2100 therapeutic candidate by the end of 2024.
 PR300 Overview—GPCR Modulator Small Molecule
Our PR300 program targets an orphan G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed predominantly in the GI tract that we believe has important functions underlying intestinal epithelial integrity and innate immune cell function. We have identified a coding SNP in the gene of this target that represents a strong genetic association with IBD and potentially other immune-mediated diseases.
Other Development Programs
We continue to evaluate numerous other drug targets identified through Prometheus360 for therapeutic utility for potential drug discovery development.
 Our Strategy
Our goal is to revolutionize the treatment of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases with a precision medicine approach for patients with significant unmet medical needs. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:
•Advance PRA023 through pivotal clinical trials in UC and CD. We are focused on advancing PRA023 into Phase 3 pivotal trials in UC and CD in 2023 after we meet with the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities and finalize our Phase 3 clinical trial strategy. In our Phase 3 trials for PRA023, we plan to utilize our 200 mg/ml subcutaneous formulation in an autoinjector, which demonstrated greater than 80% bioavailability in our subcutaneous bridging study in Caucasian normal healthy volunteers.
 •Maximize the value of PRA023 by expanding into additional indications. Because PRA023 targets both inflammation and fibrosis, additional indications in pulmonary, dermatology, or hepatobiliary disease, for example, may also benefit from therapeutic modulation of TL1A. In the first quarter of 2022, we initiated a Phase 2 placebo-controlled study in SSc-ILD. We continue to investigate the use of PRA023 in additional indications and plan to announce a potential fourth indication in 2023.
 •Advance PRA052 through clinical trials. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a Phase 1 single ascending dose/multiple ascending dose clinical trial of PRA052 in normal healthy volunteers and expect topline results in the fourth quarter of 2023. We are also developing a proprietary genetics-based diagnostic test for PRA052 to identify patients that are more likely to respond to CD30L inhibition.
 •Leverage Prometheus360 to advance our pipeline. Prometheus360 serves as our target, drug and diagnostic discovery and development engine. We have generated a robust pipeline of therapeutic development programs for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, and also plan to leverage Prometheus360 to design and develop diagnostic candidates to pair with our therapeutic candidates.
 Limitations of Current IBD Drug Development
Despite the increasing global burden of IBD, the lack of evolution and innovation in drug development has left many patients with suboptimal responses to existing therapies. While there are many programs and mechanisms of action in development for IBD, nearly all are primarily focused on inflammation, and multiple programs are pursuing the same well-established targets and pathways. The quantitative efficacy of approved treatments and therapies in development has remained stagnant since the approval of the first anti-TNF antibody for use in IBD. There is a growing need to discover new targets and pathways that have the potential to deliver breakthrough efficacy and provide patients with more meaningful treatment options.
 Attempts to identify new, targeted therapeutics for IBD through the use of publicly available clinical datasets have been hampered by the significant challenges associated with generating high-volume and high-quality data in a standardized manner from these datasets.

Furthermore, while post-hoc analysis of clinical trial data can be helpful to retrospectively understand patient responses to particular therapeutics, the ability to use these data for understanding pathway pathogenesis in IBD or target discovery for IBD is limited.
Our Prometheus360TM Precision Medicine Platform
We believe that Prometheus360 can potentially revolutionize the drug development and treatment paradigm for patients by utilizing genetics-based precision medicine to increase our probability of success. Prometheus360 enables us to select drug targets genetically associated with diseases and develop genetic-based diagnostics designed to identify patients more likely to respond favorably to specific therapies we are developing. Prometheus360 has three main components: (1) our comprehensive clinical data; (2) our large collection of biospecimens; and (3) our advanced data analytics capabilities.
Prometheus360 includes our extensive clinical database and associated biobank, which is one of the world’s largest collections of biospecimens from patients suffering from IBD and other GI disorders. This database and biobank, which we exclusively license from Cedars-Sinai, includes more than 200,000 samples linked to extensive clinical data from over 20,000 patients collected and curated over more than 20 years. Clinical data sources included in Prometheus360 include electronic medical records, imaging data, clinical chemistry, pathology records and serologies. As such, clinical history, response to therapies and longitudinal data are available to us for analysis. In addition to clinical data, we have access to relevant, well-annotated patient samples for translational validation of therapeutic targets to help guide therapeutic development. Stored biorepository patient samples available to us include tissue biopsies (either from endoscopy or from surgery), serum/plasma, DNA, RNA, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC), immortalized patient-derived B cells, stool and mesenteric adipose tissue. For many patients, we have multiple types of samples collected over multiple years. Samples from Prometheus360 are routinely interrogated by deep molecular profiling including SNP genotyping, whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, metabolomics and microbiomics. In addition to this large, well-annotated IBD cohort of data and biosamples, Prometheus360 also contains samples derived from independent cohorts and samples, such as samples collected from healthy relatives of patients, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in the discovery and development of our novel drug targets, therapeutic candidates, and related diagnostic candidates.
Prometheus360 relies on advanced datamining and bio-analytical capabilities that we employ to uncover insights about immunological pathways that drive IBD and other immune-mediated diseases, while providing a holistic view of the biology surrounding potential targets. We apply machine-learning algorithms to our clinical data and molecular profiling data to reveal disease-related trends, patterns and associations that are more reflective of what happens at a molecular level in complex immune-mediated diseases. Unlike traditionally employed strategies such as relying on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) alone, our bioinformatics approach allows us to discover and examine the joint effects of multiple genetic variants working in concert in key inflammatory pathways that contribute to the development and progression of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases. As a consequence, our approach allows us to create complex algorithm-based diagnostic product candidates that we use to identify patients likely to benefit from our therapeutic product candidates.
IBD and Market Opportunity Overview
 IBD is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory disease of the GI tract. It is a complex disease with many contributing factors, including genetic, environmental and immunologic. IBD typically onsets during adolescence and young adulthood and is diagnosed based on clinical, laboratory, endoscopy and histopathology and/or imaging findings. The IBD market is approximately $18 billion globally and is estimated to grow to approximately $49 billion globally by 2030.
UC and CD are the two most common types of IBD. UC causes long-lasting inflammation and ulcers in the digestive tract and affects the innermost lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. UC is debilitating and can lead to life-threatening complications. There are no treatments that cure UC and patients often require life-long treatment. Symptoms include diarrhea, bloody stools, abdominal pain and cramping, urgency to defecate, inability to defecate despite urgency, weight loss, fatigue, and fever. Chronic inflammation associated with UC puts a patient at increased risk of developing colon cancer. UC affects an estimated 926,000 people in the United States and 2,750,000 people globally.
CD also causes long-lasting inflammation and ulcers in the digestive tract. It differs from UC in that it affects the entire thickness of the bowel wall and all parts of the digestive tract from mouth to anus. There are no treatments that cure the disease and patients often require life-long treatment. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, fatigue, abdominal pain and cramping, bloody stools, mouth sores, reduced appetite and weight loss, and pain or drainage near or around the anus due to development of fistula from the inflammation. CD affects an estimated 1,157,000 people in the United States, and 2,446,000 people globally. The development of abnormal narrowing of the digestive tract, known as stricture, is common and is the leading indication requiring surgical intervention. Up to 70% of CD patients develop a stricturing or perforating complication, and the use of anti-inflammatory agents over the past decade has not materially changed the rate of need for surgical resection due to stricturing disease.

IBD Current Treatments and Limitations
Medical treatment of IBD is typically divided into two types of therapy: induction and maintenance. Induction therapy is used to reduce inflammation quickly (in three months or less) and maintenance therapy is used to sustain that reduction after three months. Patients with IBD are classified as mild, moderate or severe, based on the level of symptoms experienced, inflammatory biomarkers, and severity of disease on endoscopy. The current standard of care for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe IBD is typically anti-inflammatory agents.
Aminosalicylates (5-ASAs) are used as a first-line therapy in mild-to-moderate UC. Corticosteroids are used primarily during induction therapy and are effective for reducing symptoms but not for mucosal healing. There are serious side effects with extended corticosteroid use, including lowered quality of life, bone loss, weight gain and cardiovascular complications. Because of these serious long-term safety concerns, corticosteroids are used primarily as a bridge to manage symptoms until immunomodulators or biologic agents become effective and enable mucosal healing. Oral immunosuppressants (e.g. azathioprine and 6-mercatopurine) have not been effective as induction agents and are generally used for steroid-sparing or as an adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity against biologic agents. Oral immunosuppressants are also associated with known toxicities such as drops in white blood cell counts and increased risk for infection.
Since the approval of the first anti-TNF agent for the treatment of CD in 1998, the availability of JAK inhibitors (in UC) and newer biological agents, including anti-integrin and anti-IL12/23, as well as oral S1P modulators (in UC), has improved the care of moderate-to-severe IBD, but many of these are anti-inflammatory agents and have safety and tolerability concerns due to their systemic impact and resulting effects on the immune system outside of the GI tract. In late 2021, the FDA issued a black box warning to the JAK inhibitor drug class with indication for the treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, based on an increased risk of serious heart-related events such as heart attack or stroke, cancer, blood clots, and death.
 More importantly, these subsequently approved therapies have generally failed to demonstrate a clinical remission effect size of more than 15% relative to placebo. Moreover, among those patients who do respond to therapy, up to 45% will lose response over time. As a consequence, despite the advances in approved therapies over the past two decades, more than 15% of UC and 50% of CD patients require surgery within 10 years of diagnosis. The most common cause of surgery in UC is progressive disease not responsive to medical therapy and in CD it is development of strictures and/or perforation, requiring surgical resection of the intestine.
 While fibrosis and stricturing are common in CD, clinically observable colonic strictures have also been reported in up to 11% of patients with UC, and we believe microscopic submucosal fibrosis is actually much more prevalent in UC patients than reported. In a study that examined 89 consecutive UC colectomy specimens from Cleveland Clinic, submucosal fibrosis was detected in 100% of the specimens. Microscopic evidence of fibrosis in the colonic wall may have significant clinical implications such as motility abnormalities leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, urgency and incontinence. It has long been speculated that intestinal fibrosis may be the underlying cause of persistent UC symptoms, after the resolution of inflammation, that is commonly misclassified as irritable bowel syndrome.
Current treatment of IBD applies a one-size-fits-all approach without regard to genetic or biological variations in patients. We believe there must be a paradigm shift towards developing specific therapies for patients whose disease is driven by a specific biology. To date, we believe there are no clinical stage programs focused on integrating precision therapeutics with diagnostics to overcome the limitations of a one-size-fits-all treatment approach for IBD. Additionally, despite the advances in anti-inflammatory therapeutics for the treatment of UC and CD over the past two decades, fibrosis in these patients has largely not been addressed by therapy, representing an area of high unmet need. There is currently no therapy approved or under development that directly targets the reversal of fibrosis in IBD.
Our Solutions for the Treatment of IBD
PRA023 (anti-TL1A mAb)
Our lead product candidate, PRA023, is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has been shown to block the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like ligand 1A (TL1A), a target associated with both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis. PRA023’s dual mechanism of action, targeting both inflammation and fibrosis, also provides a strong rationale for advancing PRA023 into clinical trials for indications beyond IBD. In December 2021, we announced topline results from our Phase 1 clinical trial for PRA023, a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PRA023 in normal healthy volunteers and observed that PRA023 was well-tolerated, with no safety signal identified during the study.
In December 2022, we reported topline results from Cohort 1 of our Phase 2 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial of PRA023 in patients with moderate-to-severe UC (ARTEMIS-UC) and results from our open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of PRA023 in patients with moderate-to-severe CD (APOLLO-CD) and demonstrated strong efficacy and favorable safety results in both studies. Based on

the totality of the data in these two studies, we intend to advance PRA023 into Phase 3 studies for UC and CD in 2023, after we meet with FDA and foreign regulatory authorities and finalize our P3 clinical trial strategy. In our Phase 3 trials, we plan to utilize our 200 mg/ml subcutaneous formulation in an autoinjector, which demonstrated greater than 80% bioavailability in our subcutaneous bridging study in Caucasian normal healthy volunteers.
 ARTEMIS-UC: Phase 2 Clinical Trial of PRA023 in Ulcerative Colitis
 Our Phase 2 ARTEMIS-UC clinical trial was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PRA023 in patients with moderately to severely active UC who have failed conventional or advanced therapy. PRA023 met the primary and all ranked secondary endpoints including clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and patient-reported outcome measures in Cohort 1 of the trial. All 68 of the 68 PRA023-treated patients completed the Cohort 1 study, compared to 60 of the 67 patients in the placebo group. The topline results for the key endpoints were as follows:

 | 26.5% of patients on PRA023 reached the primary endpoint of clinical remission (per modified Mayo Score), compared to 1.5% on placebo, for a placebo-adjusted clinical remission rate of 25.0% on the primary endpoint (p<0.0001);


 | 36.8% of patients on PRA023 reached the secondary endpoint of endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopy subscore of ≤ 1), compared to 6.0% on placebo, for a placebo-adjusted endoscopic improvement rate of 30.8% on the secondary endpoint (p<0.0001); and


 | All secondary endpoints met with statistical significance.

 PRA023 was well tolerated in ARTEMIS-UC Cohort 1, with no treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation, severe AEs, opportunistic infections or infusion reactions reported in the PRA023 treatment group. The only AE that occurred in more than two patients and at a higher frequency in the PRA023 group compared to placebo was COVID-19 (5 out of 68 [7.4%] and 3 out of 67 patients [4.5%], respectively).
 We also conducted an interim analysis of ARTEMIS-UC, Cohort 1 to evaluate the effectiveness of our diagnostic candidate. Although from limited patient numbers, data from the subset of patients who tested positive on our diagnostic candidate (N=32) demonstrated a placebo-adjusted clinical remission rate of 37.5%, compared with the placebo-adjusted remission rate of 25.0% across all patients treated with PRA023 in Cohort 1. Cohort 2 is designed to further assess the treatment effect of PRA023 in patients who test positive on our diagnostic candidate, and we expect topline results in the second quarter of 2023.
 The ARTEMIS-UC study also includes an open-label extension after the 12-week induction study. Clinical responders are stratified by their positive or negative diagnostic status and re-randomized into two different maintenance dose arms of 250 mg IV every 4 weeks or 100 mg IV every 4 weeks. Non-responders at the end of induction have the option for a course of open-label induction therapy. Responders at the end of this open-label induction therapy will be randomized to the two maintenance dose regimen and non-responders are discontinued from the study.
 
APOLLO-CD: Phase 2a Clinical Trial of PRA023 in Crohn’s Disease
 Our Phase 2a APOLLO-CD clinical trial was a 12-week open-label study that enrolled 55 patients with moderate-to-severely active CD with endoscopically active disease who had failed conventional or biologic therapy. The study enrolled a highly refractory patient population with 70.9% of patients previously treated with at least one biologic therapy and 52.7% treated with two or more biologic therapies. The results on the key endpoints were as follows:

 | 26.0% of patients on PRA023 achieved endoscopic response (p=0.002 compared to 12% prespecified historical placebo rate); and


 | 49.1% of patients on PRA023 achieved clinical remission (p<0.001 compared to 16% prespecified historical placebo rate).

 PRA023 was well tolerated in the APOLLO-CD study. There were no treatment-emergent SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, or severe AEs, in each case, assessed as related to PRA023 by the investigator. There were no opportunistic infections or infusion reactions reported. AEs that occurred in more than two patients included COVID-19, urinary tract infection, CD, anemia, nasopharyngitis and fatigue.
 In the APOLLO-CD study, we utilized our prespecified genetic markers in an alternative CD-specific diagnostic algorithm which demonstrated 45.0% (9/20) endoscopic response relative to all-comers of 26% (13/50), and we plan to advance this alternative algorithm into registrational studies for CD. In addition, a compelling reduction in markers of inflammation and fibrosis was observed

between pre-treatment and post-treatment with PRA023, as measured by circulating cytokine levels, immunohistochemistry and gene expression in disease tissue.
 The APOLLO-CD study also includes an open-label extension at the end of the 12-week induction study, in which clinical responders are re-randomized to the two maintenance doses (250 mg IV every 4 weeks or 100 mg IV every 4 weeks) and non-responders will be discontinued from the study.
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial of PRA023
 In December 2021, reported results from our Phase 1 clinical trial of PRA023 in normal healthy volunteers. The Phase 1 clinical trial was a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which normal healthy volunteers received IV administration of PRA023. The study enrolled 69 healthy volunteers with 6 cohorts of subjects in the single ascending dose (SAD) phase dosed up to 1000 mg and 3 cohorts of subjects in the multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase dosed up to 500 mg every other week for a total of three doses.
The primary outcome measure was safety and tolerability over 14 weeks in the SAD and 18 weeks in the MAD. PRA023 was well-tolerated, with 68 of the 69 patients completing all doses and the follow-up period. There were no apparent safety signals identified during the study. There were no infusion reactions nor drug-related extension in infusion time at doses of up to 1000 mg delivered intravenously over 30 minutes. There were no clinically significant changes reported in physical exam, lab values, ECG or vital signs. All adverse events assessed as related to the study drug, including somnolence, headache, diarrhea and dizziness, were mild in severity and equally distributed between PRA023 and placebo treatment arms. There were no related adverse events reported in the highest dose group of 500 mg every other week.
 The Phase 1 study also evaluated the secondary outcome measures of pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity. Dose-proportional exposure was observed at doses of ≥ 100 mg. PRA023 demonstrated a half-life of approximately 19 days after administration of 500 mg every other week. We believe the PK profile observed in this study supports the dosing regimen selected for the currently ongoing Phase 2 UC and Phase 2a CD studies. Figures below show the geometric mean serum PRA023 concentration-to-time profile following single dose and multiple doses of PRA023 Q2W administration (on Days 1, 15, and 29) as IV infusion.
 One of the secondary outcomes for the trial was the rate of immunogenicity associated with PRA023 after single and multiple doses, measured up to 14 and 18 weeks. The observed immunogenicity rate overall was 65% during the SAD and MAD phases of the study. Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were observed to be associated with low doses and only when PRA023 drug concentration was low; specifically, there were no observations of ADA at PRA023 drug concentration greater than 29 µg/mL. ADAs did not have any apparent impact on safety outcomes, pharmacokinetics parameters, and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters. Less than 20% of subjects who received clinically relevant doses of PRA023 (1,000 mg for SAD cohort and 200 mg to 500 mg for MAD cohort) developed ADAs through the prolonged follow up period and only in 1 out of 17 subjects (6%) across the clinically relevant dose groups developed neutralizing antibodies.
 The Phase 1 study also evaluated target engagement by PRA023 by measuring the total TL1A level in the serum. PRA023 binds to both the active trimeric form of TLIA and the inactive monomeric form of TL1A. The Phase 1 data demonstrated that target engagement by PRA023 was more than 4-times higher than would otherwise be expected if PRA023 only bound to trimeric TL1A. We believe that neutralization of both forms of TL1A will lead to increased target engagement and thereby to potentially more effective reduction of active TL1A in the disease tissue. Figures below show the median serum TL1A concentration (semi-log scale) following single dose and multiple dose of PRA023 Q2W administration (on Days 1, 15, and 29) as IV infusion.
 Preclinical Studies of PRA023
 In in vitro studies, PRA023 blocked TL1A’s ability to bind and activate its receptor, DR3. In whole blood, PRA023 inhibited the TL1A-dependent IFN-g response following the ex vivo exposure to immune-complex and a combination of IL-12 and IL-18. Additionally, PRA023 was observed to be highly selective for TL1A with no detectable binding to related TNF super family members FAS, LIGHT, or TRAIL.
We assessed the potential toxicity of PRA023 in a series of nonclinical in vitro assays and in vivo studies in cynomolgus monkeys. The monkey was selected as a pharmacologically relevant nonclinical species because of similar TL1A protein sequence homology and nearly equivalent binding affinity of PRA023 to monkey TL1A, as compared to human. PRA023 is similarly active in monkey and human in vitro cell-based assays.
PRA023 has been engineered to remove the potential for the mAb to induce an immune response. In non-good laboratory practice (GLP) cell-based in vitro assays, PRA023 treatment did not lead to complement- or cell-mediated cytotoxicity or to cytokine release from peripheral blood cells thus indicating that it was not provoking an undesired immune response.


In a non-GLP tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) study, cynomolgus monkeys (1/sex/group) were administered PRA023 IV at 30, 100 and 243 mg/kg/week on Days 1 and 8 and subsequently followed for approximately 11 weeks to assess systemic exposure of PRA023. There were no PRA023-related clinical observations or changes in body weight, clinical chemistry, or hematology parameters. PK measurements suggested that PRA023 has a half-life of 5 to 11 days in cynomolgus monkeys, which is consistent with human IgG1 in this species.
Six-week and 6-month Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in cynomolgus monkeys with a 6-week recovery period. In the 6-month toxicity study, PRA023 was administered to monkeys once weekly via IV injection for up to 6 months. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the 6-month study was 300 mg/kg/week (the highest dose tested). No PRA023-related mortality or clinical signs were observed, and no body weight, food consumption, clinal pathology (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis), ECG, ophthalmic, neurobehavioral, body temperature, respirator, organ weight, or macroscopic or microscopic changes were observed at the end of the dosing or recovery phases after six months of repeat dosing in monkeys. No PRA023-related effects were noted in lymphocyte subsets. All animals mounted a robust anti-KLH IgG and IgM response, suggesting an intact humoral immunity.
After IV administration of PRA023 to monkeys in the 6-week repeat-dose toxicity study, findings that were secondary to generation of ADA and immune complex deposition in response to administration of a foreign protein (humanized monoclonal antibody) to immunocompetent animals were observed (including the death of one low dose animal). Similar findings were not observed in the 6-month monkey toxicity study using the same dosing regimen and dose levels, confirming that the findings in the 6-week repeat-dose toxicity study were secondary to ADA formation and not directly related to the mechanism of action of PRA023.
PRA023 for the Treatment of Immune-Mediated Diseases – Beyond IBD
 We believe PRA023 has the potential to be a differentiated therapy for patients suffering from various immune-mediated diseases, beyond IBD, due to PRA023’s unique dual mechanism including both anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. The TL1A-DR3 pathway is known to broadly modulate multiple immune cell types and pathways, in addition to having a direct effect on fibroblasts proliferation and differentiation.
 Systemic Sclerosis-associated Interstitial Lung Disease (SSc-ILD)
 Systemic sclerosis, also called scleroderma, is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that causes fibrosis, or scarring/hardening, of skin and internal organs. It is not known what causes scleroderma, but this orphan disease affects more than 100,000 people in the United States and 80,000 people in Europe, with limited treatment options. More than half of scleroderma patients suffer from interstitial lung disease (ILD), a condition characterized by fibrosis and loss of function of the lungs. This syndrome is termed systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), and it is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in scleroderma, accounting for one third of deaths. SSc-ILD tends to present as nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, which implies a mixed pathogenesis of inflammation and fibrosis.
SSc-ILD is progressive in most patients and is thought to be largely irreversible. As a result, stabilization has historically been the goal of therapy. Immunosuppressive therapies are prescribed off-label and may provide some relief without specific approval for this indication. In the past two years, two biologics were approved for SSc-ILD, but these only modestly slow the rate of decline in lung function and neither of these therapies has led to meaningful benefits for disease modification as measured using skin thickness scoring, dyspnea, general quality of life or survival.
 We believe SSc-ILD is a compelling third indication for PRA023. TL1A inhibition has a unique dual mechanism with both anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects and SSc-ILD is a disease of inflammation and fibrosis with a pathophysiology that implicates many pathways modulated by TL1A-DR3 interactions. Blocking TL1A has been linked to reductions in Th1, Th17 and Th2 immune responses, while also modulating key pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory cytokine such as IL-13 and TGF-β. In addition to their roles in driving inflammation, TL1A and DR3 have also been implicated in driving fibrosis by direct signaling in fibroblasts, even in the absence of a fully functional immune system, leading to collagen disposition and fibrosis.
 A causal link between the TL1A-DR3 axis and fibrosis has been demonstrated in mouse models of lung fibrosis. Specifically, DR3 deficiency or TL1A blockade was sufficient to significantly ameliorate fibrotic lung remodeling in bleomycin and dust-mite antigen models. Additionally, direct instillation of recombinant TL1A into the lungs of mice initiated rapid onset of fibrosis and smooth muscle cell proliferation in a DR3-dependent manner. Primary human lung fibroblasts and bronchial epithelial cells express the TL1A receptor, DR3, and respond to recombinant TL1A in vitro by proliferating, expressing smooth muscle actin, and secreting extracellular matrix proteins, collagen, and periostin. Serum TL1A levels were higher in patients with systemic sclerosis than in healthy controls (p = 0.001) and TL1A mRNA expression in PBMCs was significantly higher in patients with systemic sclerosis compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Agents that disrupt the TL1A signaling through DR3 have the potential to prevent deregulated tissue cell activity in lung diseases that involve fibrosis and remodeling.


PRA023 for SSc-ILD
 In the first quarter of 2022, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial for PRA023 in SSc-ILD (ATHENA-SSc-ILD). The ATHENA-SSc-ILD is designed to enroll approximately 100 patients who will be randomized 1:1 to either the active or placebo arm. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the change in forced vital capacity (FVC) at 50 weeks. Secondary endpoints will include change in quantitative interstitial lung disease by centrally-read high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and improvement in the American College of Rheumatology Combined Response Index in Diffuse SSc (ACR-CRISS) score. We also plan to evaluate a variety of patient reported outcomes for dyspnea, disability, effects of skin thickening, and bowel function. This trial will also assess the performance of our diagnostic candidate for PRA023. Topline results from ATHENA-SSc-ILD are expected in the first half of 2024.
 In January 2022, we announced that the FDA granted fast track designation for PRA023 for the treatment of SSc-ILD. Fast track designation aims to expedite the development and review process for new therapeutics that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and potentially address an unmet medical need. Drug candidates that are granted this designation are given the opportunity for more frequent interactions with the FDA, as well as potential pathways for expedited review and approval.
 Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect intellectual property and other proprietary rights for our current and future product therapeutic and diagnostic candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies, patient enrichment strategies and diagnostics, and know-how, to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or exclusively in-licensing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing of intellectual property to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
As for the therapeutic product candidates we are developing and seeking to commercialize, we intend to pursue composition and therapeutic method of use patents, dosage formulation patents, and therapeutic use patents on novel indications. For our therapeutic product candidates that are biologics, and more particularly monoclonal antibodies, we also intend to seek protection for epitopes, amino acid and nucleotide sequences, and other claims conventionally used to protect aspects of therapeutic biological agents. As for diagnostic and prognostic product candidates and therapeutic product candidates, we intend to pursue methods of use patents on novel patient selection methods for our therapeutic candidates and known compounds, and novel patient stratification criteria useful in the prognosis or diagnosis of disease. We may also pursue patents with respect to our proprietary screening and drug development processes and technology. We may also seek patent protection, either alone or jointly with our collaborators, as our collaboration agreements may dictate.
Our patent portfolio as of February 17, 2023 includes approximately 22 issued U.S. patents, 31 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and 26 pending U.S. provisional patent applications with claims relating to our diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic product candidates, all of which are owned or in-licensed by us. We own or co-own 5 of the issued U.S. patents and own or co-own approximately 9 of the pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications. We license approximately 21 of the issued U.S. patents, as well as 28 of the pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications. Our patent portfolio as of February 17, 2023 also includes approximately 11 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications and certain foreign counterparts of the aforementioned U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications in at least one of the following foreign countries or regions: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan and countries within the European Patent Convention and Eurasia with claims relating to our diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic product candidates.
With respect to our lead therapeutic product candidate, PRA023, we own and/or license four issued U.S. patents, four pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, seven pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and four pending PCT applications in fourteen different patent families relating to the composition of PRA023 and/or its therapeutic use, as well as one issued U.S. patent, two pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, three pending U.S. provisional patent applications, and one pending PCT applications in three different patent families related to the diagnostic for PRA023. In addition, our patent portfolio directed to the composition of PRA023 and its diagnostic includes foreign counterparts in foreign countries or regions, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Israel, India, Mexico, South Africa, Chile, United Kingdom, Colombia, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Taiwan, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Canada, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Korea, China, Indonesia, New Zealand, Venezuela, as well as countries within the European Patent Convention and Eurasian Patent Organization. As of February 17, 2023, we expect the expiry dates for the issued U.S. patents for the composition of PRA023 to be 2037 for the first patent family, 2039 for the second patent family, 2040 for the third family, and 2042 for the fourth family, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees.


As of February 17, 2023, we own and/or license one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application and two pending U.S. provisional patent applications related to the composition of PRA052 and its therapeutic use, and we co-own and license one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application and four U.S. provisional patent applications related to patient selection for our PRA052 program. In addition, our non-U.S. patent portfolio directed to the composition of PRA052 or patient selection for PRA052 includes one pending PCT application and foreign counterparts of the aforementioned U.S. patent application in foreign countries or regions, including Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan, as well as countries within the European Patent Convention. As of February 17, 2023, we expect the U.S. non-provisional patent application related to the composition of PRA052 and its therapeutic use, if issued, to expire no earlier than 2042, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees.
Provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of one or more of our related provisional patent applications. Moreover, PCT patent applications are not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file one or more national stage patent applications within, depending on the country, 30 to 32 months of the PCT application’s priority date in the countries in which we seek patent protection. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent applications or national stage patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications or PCT patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications and national stage patent applications relating to our PCT patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage.
Individual issued patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. The term of a patent, and the protection it affords, is therefore limited and once the patent term of our issued patents have expired, we may face competition, including from other competing technologies. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.
In addition, in certain instances, a U.S. patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period or delay by the USPTO in issuing the patent. However, with respect to patent term extensions granted as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years, the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug or a method for using it may be extended. We may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. There can be no assurance that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.
The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.
If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, third parties, including our competitors, may be able to use our technologies to produce and market drugs or diagnostic and/or prognostic products in direct competition with us and erode our competitive advantage. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we may develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions that may diminish our ability to protect our intellectual property. For more information regarding risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Rapidly evolving patent laws in the United States and elsewhere make it difficult to predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Moreover, patent offices in general can require that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we are able to obtain patents, the patents may be substantially narrower than anticipated.
Our ability to maintain and defend our intellectual property and proprietary position for our products, product candidates and other technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know

whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own, may receive in the future, or license from third parties may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, narrowed or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against third parties, including our competitors, with similar technology. Furthermore, third parties, including our competitors, may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or products, or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents.
Trade Secrets
We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop, protect and maintain our competitive position and aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not presently consider appropriate for, patent protection and prevent competitors from reverse engineering or copying our technologies. However, the foregoing rights are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. There can be no assurance that these agreements will be self-executing or otherwise provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by third parties, including our competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information regarding risks related to our trade secrets, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Collaboration and License Agreement Overview
Our Collaboration with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
In September 2017, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Cedars-Sinai, as amended and restated (the Cedars-Sinai Agreement) that grants us an exclusive, worldwide license from Cedars-Sinai with respect to certain patent rights, information and materials related to therapeutic targets and diagnostic product candidates for the diagnosis and treatment of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases, in each case to conduct research and development, as well as to commercialize diagnostic or therapeutic products (Cedars-Sinai Products) that are covered by the patents or that are developed through use of the licensed rights. As upfront consideration for the original license agreement, we issued to Cedars-Sinai 257,500 shares of fully vested common stock and 335,000 shares of restricted common stock, which shares fully vested in September 2020. We are obligated to pay Cedars-Sinai low- to mid-single digit percentage royalties on net sales of therapeutic and diagnostic Cedars-Sinai Products. In August 2021, we amended and restated the Cedars-Sinai Agreement to, among other things, add a joint steering committee and cover new intellectual property.
 The technology subject to the foregoing license includes information and materials arising out of the Cedars-Sinai database and biobank, as well as exclusive access to this database and biobank to develop diagnostic and therapeutic products for human use, which biobank is an integral part of our Prometheus360 platform. All of our current pipeline programs and any related diagnostic candidates are all covered as Cedars-Sinai Products under the agreement, to the extent covered by the licensed patents or developed through the licensed rights. We were also granted an exclusive first right to negotiate with Cedars-Sinai to obtain exclusive licenses to future patent rights claiming inventions invented by certain Cedars-Sinai employees after the effective date of the agreement through any use of the patent rights and technology licensed to us by Cedars-Sinai. We have the right to sublicense our rights under the license agreement, subject to certain conditions. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize Cedars-Sinai Products and to achieve certain development and regulatory milestones.
 The term of, and our royalty obligations under, the license agreement expires on a licensed Cedars-Sinai Product-by-Cedars-Sinai Product and country-by-country basis on the later of ten years from the date of first commercial sale or when there is no longer a valid patent covering such licensed Cedars-Sinai Product in such country. As of February 17, 2023, the estimated expiry date for the latest to expire valid patent will be July 2043, if issued. We may terminate the agreement in the event that we determine that it would not be commercially reasonable to continue to develop and/or commercialize Cedars-Sinai Products. Cedars-Sinai may terminate the agreement if the performance by either party would jeopardize Cedars-Sinai’s legal status or is illegal or unethical. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. The agreement will terminate automatically in the event of our bankruptcy. Upon termination of the agreement for any reason all rights and licenses granted to us under the agreement will terminate.
Our Collaboration with Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH


In July 2020, we entered into a co-development and manufacturing agreement (the Falk Agreement) with Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH (Falk), pursuant to which we will co-develop and commercialize, exclusively in our respective territories, our PR052 therapeutic product candidate and related diagnostic candidate. Under the Falk Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct such development activities under an agreed development plan and we are responsible for regulatory approvals and commercialization of any products in the United States and the rest of the world, other than the Falk territory. Falk is responsible for regulatory approvals and commercialization of any products in the European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland, the countries of the European Economic Area (excluding Malta and the Republic of Cyprus), Australia and New Zealand (Falk territory). Under the agreement, Falk agreed to fund 25% of our third-party development costs set forth in the development plan.
Under the agreement, Falk paid us an upfront payment following our mutual agreement on the development plan and milestone payments upon the selection of a clinical candidate for our PRA052 program and upon our development of a diagnostic candidate for the PRA052 program. Falk is also obligated to pay us a mid-single to low-double digit royalty on net sales of all products incorporating antibodies covered by the agreement in the Falk territory. We agreed to pay Falk a low-single digit royalty on net sales for such products in our territory. Any intellectual property, including know-how, owned by us, Falk, or our respective affiliates that existed prior to the effective date of the agreement or is generated during the term of the agreement, that is also necessary or useful to develop, manufacture, or commercialize the compounds and/or products that result from the collaboration, are jointly owned by us and Falk at a share of 75% for us and a 25% for Falk.
The term of, and our respective royalty obligations under, the agreement expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the later of (i) ten years from the date of first commercial sale, (ii) when there is no longer a valid patent covering a product in such country, or (iii) expiration of any applicable regulatory exclusivity for such product. As of February 17, 2023, the estimated expiry date for the latest to expire valid patent will be July 2043, if issued. Falk may terminate the agreement without cause, and either party may terminate the agreement for regulatory or scientific reasons. In the event of such termination, all licenses granted to the terminating party will cease and be transferred to the non-terminating party, and such non-terminating party will have access to the know-how and any other intellectual property controlled by the terminating party, if in existence as of the effective date of the agreement or during the term of the agreement, provided the know-how and other intellectual property is necessary or useful to develop, manufacture, or commercialize the therapeutic candidates under the PRA052 program, subject to the obligation to pay the applicable royalties to the terminating party. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by, or bankruptcy of, the other party. In the event of such termination, the terminating party has the option to purchase the non-terminating party’s ownership share of any jointly owned intellectual property at a fair market price. Additionally, in the event of such termination for uncured material breach or bankruptcy: all rights of the terminating party granted under the agreement will be maintained and extended as required to develop, manufacture and commercialize the compounds and/or products that result from the collaboration for the remainder of the term, while any licenses granted to the non-terminating party shall terminate upon the effective date of termination and the obligation of each party to co-fund development will remain unaffected.
 Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and related raw materials, including our autoinjector, for preclinical and clinical development, as well as for commercial manufacture of any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval. We believe there are multiple sources for all of the materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates and development programs. As our product candidates advance through development, we expect to enter into longer-term commercial supply agreements with key suppliers and manufacturers to fulfill and secure our production needs.
Sales and Marketing
We believe that we can maximize the value of our products by retaining substantial commercialization rights to our therapeutic and diagnostic product candidates. As we progress PRA023 and other development programs through clinical development, we will leverage the knowledge and experience of our commercial team and company brand awareness to prepare for and implement a potential product launch. We may also explore and evaluate entering into strategic collaborations for specific therapeutic indications or geographic territories in order to maximize the value of PRA023 and our product candidates.
 We have global commercial rights to PRA023 and our diagnostic candidate. Our current commercial strategy is to market PRA023 and the diagnostic candidate using a dedicated sales force focused on selected gastroenterologists, rheumatologists, and other physicians in the United States. These target prescribers are typically affiliated with leading hospitals and medical centers and tend to have well-established referral networks. We expect to benefit from preexisting relationships with many of these prescribers and believe that we can appropriately manage outreach and effectively commercialize PRA023 through a specialty care sales model. We retain rights similar to those for PRA023 for each of our unpartnered programs. For PRA052, which is subject to the Falk collaboration, we have exclusively outlicensed commercialization rights to Falk in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. However, we

retain commercial rights to our PRA052 program in the United States and the rest of the world and plan to take a similar commercialization approach as with PRA023, if approved.
 Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology and development experience, our Prometheus360 platform and our pioneering culture provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any therapeutic candidates and diagnostics that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future.
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize therapeutic products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, or diagnostics that are more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products, including biosimilars.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our therapeutic product candidates if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level competition, intellectual property protection and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 If approved for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe IBD, PRA023 and our other development programs would compete with Entyvio, which is an a4b7 integrin antibody marketed by Takeda, Humira, which is a TNF antibody marketed by AbbVie Inc., Remicade, which is a TNF antibody marketed by Johnson & Johnson, Stelara, which is an IL-12/IL-23 antibody marketed by Johnson & Johnson, Xeljanz, which is a JAK1 inhibitor marketed by Pfizer Inc., Simponi, which is a TNF antibody marketed by Johnson & Johnson, and Zeposia, which is a S1P inhibitor marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.
We are aware of several companies with product candidates in development for the treatment of patients with UC and/or CD, including but not limited to Roivant Sciences RVT-3101 (formerly Pfizer Inc.’s PF-06480605), which is an anti-TL1A antibody being developed in Phase 2 clinical trials, Rinvoq, which is a JAK1 inhibitor being developed in Phase 3 clinical trials by AbbVie Inc., and mirikizumab, which is an anti-IL-23 antibody being developed in Phase 3 clinical trials by Eli Lilly and Company. We are also aware of additional product candidates in clinical trials by AbbVie Inc., Abivax S.A., Amgen Inc., Applied Molecular Transport Inc., Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, Bausch Health Companies, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Ko. KG, EA Pharma Co., Ltd., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Gossamer Bio, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Landos Biopharma, Inc., Morphic Holding, Inc., Merck & Co. Inc., Novartis International AG, Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc., RedHill Biopharma Ltd., Seres Therapeutics, Inc., and Ventyx Biosciences, Inc. In addition, biosimilars of Humira, Stelara and Entyvio are expected in coming years and will provide cost-effective alternatives within the biologic class.
If approved for the treatment of patients with SSc-ILD, PRA023 would compete with Ofev, which is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim AG and Actemra, which is an IL-6 antibody marketed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG.

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, pricing, and export and import of diagnostic tests and pharmaceutical products such as those we are currently marketing and developing. The process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Regulation of Diagnostic Tests and other Medical Devices
In the United States, the laws and regulations governing the marketing of diagnostic products are evolving, extremely complex, and in many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) defines a medical device to include any instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory, intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals. Among other things, pursuant to the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses.
PMA Pathway
We are developing diagnostic candidates designed to be used in connection with our therapeutic product candidates, if approved. Diagnostic products are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA categorizes medical devices into one of three classes—Class I, II, or III—based on the risks presented by the device and the regulatory controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (QSR) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Special controls are established by the FDA for a specific device type and often include specific labeling provisions, performance metrics, and other types of controls that mitigate risks of the device (usually incorrect results for an in-vitro diagnostic device (IVD)). Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of an application for premarket approval (PMA). Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
 Class III devices generally require PMA approval before they can be marketed. Obtaining PMA approval requires the submission of “valid scientific evidence” to the FDA to support a finding of a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. A PMA must provide complete analytical and clinical performance data and also information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. As part of the FDA’s review of a PMA, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with QSR requirements, which impose requirements related to design controls, manufacturing controls, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. The user fee costs and the length of FDA review time for obtaining PMA approval are significantly higher than for a 510(k) notification or a de novo classification.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.

Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
We expect that any companion diagnostic candidates we develop, either alone or in collaboration with third parties, will require approval of a PMA before they can be marketed for use with a therapeutic product.
510(k) Notification Pathway
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating to the FDA’s satisfaction that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to another legally marketed device that itself does not require PMA approval (a predicate device). A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but often takes longer. FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees and for medical device establishments. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a lawfully marketed predicate device, it will grant 510(k) clearance to authorize the device for commercialization. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, discussed below.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacturer documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) is not required. However, if the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old.
These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation. More recently, in September 2019, the FDA published revised final guidance outlining an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway, by demonstrating that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA maintains a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based pathway” and has continued to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as recommended the testing methods for such devices where feasible.
If no legally marketed predicate can be identified for a new device to enable use of the 510(k) pathway, the device is automatically classified under the FDCA into Class III, which generally requires PMA approval. However, the FDA can reclassify or seek de novo classification for a device that meets the FDCA standards for a Class I or Class II device, permitting the device to be marketed without PMA approval. To grant such a reclassification, the FDA must determine that the FDCA’s general controls alone, or general controls

and special controls together, are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness. The de novo classification route is generally less burdensome than the PMA approval process.
De Novo Classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II or III are automatically classified under the FDCA into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (FDASIA) a medical device could be eligible for de novo classification only if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the request if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) notification, determines that the device is not low to moderate risk, or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. After a device receives de novo classification, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, another de novo request or even PMA approval.
Investigational Device Exemption Process.
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping, and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs for Medical Devices
Through recent federal legislation, the FDA has implemented a Breakthrough Devices Program, which is a voluntary program offering manufacturers of certain devices an opportunity to interact with the FDA more frequently and efficiently as they develop their products with the goal of expediting commercialization of such products to help patients have more timely access. The program is available to medical devices that meet certain eligibility criteria, including that the device provides more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions, and constitutes a device (i) that represents a breakthrough technology, (ii) for which no approved or cleared alternatives exist, (iii) that offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives, or (iv) the availability of which is in the best interest of patients. Devices granted Breakthrough Device designation are eligible to rely on certain features of the Breakthrough Device Program, including interactive and timely communications with FDA staff, use of post-market data collection, when scientifically appropriate, to facilitate expedited and efficient development and review of the device, opportunities for efficient and flexible clinical study design and priority review of premarket submissions.
 Postmarket Regulation of Medical Devices
After a device is cleared or approved by the FDA for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
 •QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; 
 •labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products; 
 •requirements related to promotional activities; 
 •clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices; 
 •medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; 
 •correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
 •The FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and 
 •post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 
 Device manufacturing processes subject to FDA oversight are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. Manufacturers are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. A failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, including the following:
•issuance of warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
 •requesting or requiring recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; 
 •imposing operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 


•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; 
 •withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; 
 •refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or 
 •criminal prosecution. 
 Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an IVD, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic product candidates will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluations and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.
U.S. Regulation of Drugs and Biologics
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with GLP regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical study may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy, or with respect to biologics, the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA) or biologics license application (BLA) after completion of all pivotal clinical studies; 
 •potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed product drug substance is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and audits of selected clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP; and 
 •FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology and PD characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP, which includes the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, and any clinically important increased rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries.
The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency.
NDA and BLA Review Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated and sponsored by investigators. The submission of an NDA or BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDASIA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial pediatric study plan within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the submitted BLA or NDA to determine if the application is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once an NDA or BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is sufficient to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. When reviewing an NDA or BLA, the FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA or BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA or BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA or BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA or BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Regulation of Combination Products
 Certain therapeutic products are comprised of multiple components, such as drug components and device components, that would normally be subject to different regulatory frameworks by the FDA and frequently regulated by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a drug-device combination product is attributable to the drug product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the drug product would have primary jurisdiction

for the combination product. The FDA has also established the Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. A combination product with a primary mode of action attributable to the drug or biologic component generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to the drug approval processes set forth in the FDCA. In reviewing the NDA for such a product, however, FDA reviewers would consult with their counterparts in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA regulations, combination products are subject to cGMP requirements applicable to both drugs and devices, including the QSR applicable to medical devices.
Expedited Development and Review Programs for Drugs and Biologics
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing product candidates that meet certain criteria. Specifically, product candidates are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once an NDA or BLA is submitted, the application may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Any marketing application for a drug or biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA or BLA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For new-molecular-entity NDAs and original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled confirmatory clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required confirmatory studies in a timely manner or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
Orphan Drug Designation

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same disease or condition for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug or biologic was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the disease or condition for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Approval Requirements for Drugs and Biologics
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved NDA or BLA. Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 


•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Drug Product Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. For example, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are highly similar, or “biosimilar,” to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, is generally shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. A product shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product may rely in part on the FDA’s previous determination of safety and effectiveness for the reference product for approval, which can potentially reduce the cost and time required to obtain approval to market the product.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety,

purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
In addition to FDA regulation of pharmaceutical products, U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industries. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties. These laws include anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims laws, civil monetary penalties laws, and transparency laws with respect to drug pricing and payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals. In addition to the federal laws summarized below, we may also be subject to similar state and local laws and regulations that may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiology assistants and certified nurse-midwives) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined under the statute) and their immediate family members.
Similar state and local laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information or which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.

Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties including damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement of Drugs
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors.
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. In the United States, there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of a product, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Additionally, decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
In the United States, there have been, and continues to be, legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates. Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The ACA, among other things, increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; extended the Medicaid rebate obligation to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted.

For example, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, beginning January 1, 2024.
 Moreover, heightened governmental scrutiny is likely to continue over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has already resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) into law. This statute marks the most significant action by Congress with respect to the pharmaceutical industry since adoption of the ACA in 2010. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023), and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated, and while the impact of the IRA on the pharmaceutical industry cannot yet be fully determined, it is likely to be significant.
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union (EU), the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
To market a medicinal product in the European Economic Area (EEA) (which is comprised of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), we must obtain a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of marketing authorizations:
•“Centralized MAs” are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA and are valid throughout the EU. It is compulsory for certain types of products, such as (i) medicinal products derived from biotechnological processes, (ii) designated orphan medicinal products, (iii) advanced-therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) such as gene therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and (iv) medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for any other products containing new active substances not authorized in the EU or for product candidates which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation or for which the granting of authorization would be in the interests of public health in the EU; and 
 •“National MAs” are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their respective territory, and are available for product candidates not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.

Data and marketing exclusivity
In the EEA, new products authorized for marketing, or reference products, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Pediatric investigation plan
In the EEA, marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products not authorized have to include the results of studies conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan (PIP) agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (PDCO). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once the marketing authorization is obtained in all EU member states and study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension.
Clinical trials
Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines on GCPs as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Additional GCP guidelines from the European Commission, focusing in particular on traceability, apply to clinical trials of ATMPs. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an entity within the EU to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU member states, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (CTR) which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.
 While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application (CTA) to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed.
 The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose CTA was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. Additionally, sponsors may still choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.
 Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply and compliance with these requirements is subject to inspections by competent authorities of the EU member states.


Privacy and data protection laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations, and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, including clinical trial data, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
