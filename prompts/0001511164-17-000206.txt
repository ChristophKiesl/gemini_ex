ITEM 1.     BUSINESSCompany Overview
 True Nature Holding, Inc. (the Company), previously known as Trunity Holdings, Inc., a Delaware C corporation, became a publicly-traded company through a reverse merger with Brain Tree International, Inc., a Utah corporation (BTI). Trunity Holdings, Inc. was the parent company of the prior educational business, named Trunity, Inc., which was formed on July 28, 2009 through the acquisition of certain intellectual property by its three founders. On December 9, 2015 the Company made a decision to restructure Trunity Holdings, Inc., having acquired Newco4pharmacy, LLC, a development stage business aimed at a roll-up of compounding pharmacy businesses

True Nature Holding, Inc. is executing on a business plan to acquire a series of businesses which specialize in compounding pharmacy activities, largely direct to consumers, doctors and veterinary professionals. During 2016 the Company negotiated several agreements for the acquisition of compounding pharmacy operations, and consummated one (1). P3 Compounding Pharmacy, dba Integrity Compound, of Dunwoody Georgia completed the transfer of its pharmacy license, and was acquired on June 29, 2016. Management quickly determined that its financial needs and business plan was not in concert with the financial goals of the Company, and on September 30, 2016, the Company was deconsolidated. As a result of the deconsolidation, we do not have any operations under management at this time. The Company has since installed new management and a refined business plan for roll-up, and executed a letter intent, and other informal agreements to proceed on its plans.

Description of Pharmaceutical Compounding

Today, the vast majority of medications are mass-produced by pharmaceutical drug companies. They aim to treat a specific medical condition for a large segment of people. Problems can arise when a patient has a medical condition that cant be treated by one of these mass-produced products. Pharmaceutical compounding (done in compounding pharmacies) is the creation of a particular pharmaceutical product prescribed by doctors to fit the unique needs of a patient that cant be met by commercially available drugs. To do this, compounding pharmacists combine or process appropriate ingredients using various tools. This may be done for medically necessary reasons, such as to change the form of the medication from a solid pill to a liquid, to avoid a non-essential ingredient that the patient is allergic to, or to obtain the exact dose(s) needed or deemed best of particular active pharmaceutical ingredient(s). It may also be done for more optional reasons, such as adding flavors to a medication or otherwise altering taste or texture. Examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms, such as topical creams or gels, suspensions or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles. Compounding pharmacies (and pharmacists) adhere to standards and regulations set by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, National Association of Boards and State Boards of Pharmacy for quality assurance and accuracy. The compounding pharmacy business has the potential to provide high margins, and allow the pharmacy to specialize is certain solutions for specific maladies, so it can target specific markets efficiently. Licensing of these businesses can be under a 503A license where only a prescription for an individual can be filled, or a 503B license, which allows the operator to prepare medications for both individuals, and for stocking inventory at doctor's offices and hospitals.
New Divisional Structure

During 2016, and following the deconsolidation of P3, we revised our approach to the business strategy, and added the concept of incorporating a retail, more traditional, pharmacy business with the compounding pharmacy we had originally focused on. We also decided to develop a library of intellectual properties (IP), including specialized formulations and compounds of pharmaceutical materials, as well as potential software and systems, into a dedicated subsidiary. While we expect immediate financial results from the retail and compounding areas, we believe the IP and technology business will require substantial time to mature into a profitable business.

As a result of this revised approach, the Company intends to create three (3) wholly owned subsidiaries to hold its operations. 
 
5

The first, "TN Retail, LLC" will hold its retail storefront operations. These storefront locations will provide both conventional pharmacy products, as well as unique compounding based solutions. The store will focus on "healthy, holistic and natural solutions", along the lines of a "Whole Foods of Pharmacy" like marketing approach. This becomes the "feeder system" for sales to our planned compounding production facilities. 

There will be a separate subsidiary for its compounding pharmacy, back office production and central fill operations called "TN Compounding, LLC". This will initially be focused on the acquisition of 503a license operations, though management has envisioned a network of these facilities located regionally. It may consider a 503b licensed operation to accommodate the ability to provide both sterile and non-sterile products, including products for stocking inventory at medical offices and hospitals. 

Lastly, it expects to acquire unique related technologies, including a growing library of specialized formulations. Many of these formulations will be unique to its operations, and some it expects to either license to others for mass market distribution, or it may produce for stocking inventory at a 503b qualified facility. The entity "TN Technologies, LLC" will hold those intellectual property assets, as well as other novel new approaches it may engage in, directly, or under a license granted from the holders. 

Acquisition of Compounding Pharmacy Businesses and Financing

The Company intends to target compounders who have a) strong regulatory compliance history, b) a record of profitable operations, c) a large cash payor component (vs. insurance reimbursement), or an ability to shift from insurance to cash for their revenue, d) operations that represent a geographical hub or spoke when considered in relation to other compounders, and e) where the combination of operations including embedded retail, and online, facilitates cross selling of a growing line of products.  
 We have agreements in place, or in negotiation, for the acquisition of three (3) unique business operations. In total, they finished 2016 with over $30 million in annualized revenue, and, when owners compensation is backed out, and going forward management and costs included, should perform profitably. All have long operating histories, and all are currently profitable. Each acquisition is unique and come with different risks. We always note that past performances are not indicative of future results. Any past success is no guarantee of future profitability.
 The Southeast Group is a three-unit compounding operation who finished 2016 at over $25 million in revenues, up from $15 million in 2015. They have large library of specialty formulations. They would become the largest hub and expand their distribution through the pending retail expansion, which begins with the Miami Group, with overnight home delivery at pass-through costs.
 The Miami Group is a small retail pharmacy operation who current does 30% in compounding. They operate inside of a grocery chain, renting space from the Hispanic oriented chain in two (2) of their sixteen (16) units. Each store has over 1,500 unique client experiences, and thus far the current management has done nothing to leverage that built-in traffic. We believe the units where a new footprint can be established with generate around $1 million in annualized sales in the first 12 months after opening, and will reach their maximum at around $2 million in annualized sales. Currently the operations are thinly staffed and do not operate even 40 hours a week. Our plans are to make this the spoke and move any significant preparation work to a hub site, either at the Southeast Group location, or in the Florida Group location.
 The Florida Group is the business upon which the business plan was originally formed in 2016. They have a 15-year operating history, are an all cash business (no insurance reimbursement). They do half their business with veterinary operations, an area we would very much like to grow. The finished 2016 at over $2.7 million, up from $2.5 million, and they have no sales effort, no marketing and no significant presence. They have been size constrained by their facility size, and the lack of sales and marketing, though in early March they will move into a new space, fully compliant with the new USP 800 regulations. They will be the hub for most of the Florida operations, and their specialty formations fit the older, Florida market.

Changes Subsequent to December 31, 2016

We began 2016 with five (5) directors and a single member of the management team. By the First Quarter of 2017, the Company had in place four (4) directors and three members of the management team. We believe that True Natures management team can remain small in the near term, and will consist of a four-person management team with experience in 1) public company accounting and finance, 2) multi-unit supply chain management including retail and wholesale operations, 3) brand marketing aimed at consumer through online and traditional retail channels, and 4) public equity finance. We believe our current team addresses most of these areas, and we anticipate further additions as our size, and funding, can allow.

Market Opportunity

According to an industry report published by IBIS World, dated January 2015 there are over 5,500 compounding pharmaceutical groups in the U.S. with revenue of over $5.6 billion annually and profits exceeding $1.5 billion. Many of them are small, undercapitalized and without an exit strategy as their principals seek to retire and face potential challenges with changes in the regulatory requirements. While we do not currently have any acquisitions under a definitive contract, we have identified a number of prospects and expect to be able to close one, or more, acquisitions within six months. We intend to use equity to finance our initial transactions, and we have identified a number of institutional investors who have expressed interest in our approach. We expect to be able to use a combination of conventional debt, and equity in the Company, to raise the funds necessary to execute on the business plan with our first of two acquisitions during the second quarter of 2016. If we qualify, we would like to list the shares of the Company on the NASDAQ stock exchange, and create a market for the shares so that we can complete additional funding, pay off the debt we use to complete the initial acquisitions, and invest further in the businesses to achieve a greater size and scale.
Executive Summary - Our Strategy

Compounding pharmacies occupy a unique space in the pharmaceutic marketplace. They do not simply fill prescriptions, but rather has the capability to innovate, invent new applications of existing OTC medications, and even to reach down into the use of raw materials to compose new solutions. While most focus on medications unique to the needs in their local markets, some of those formulations could be applied regionally, and even nationally, with the right cost and distribution strategy.

We are a company focused on consolidation of the compounding pharmacy industry through opportunistic acquisitions, starting in the Southeast and then expanding across the US. We expect to rapidly scale the business through a combination of profitable acquisitions, organic growth and economies of scale. The concept is that a national organization can more effectively leverage a broader product line and operational efficiencies. We also intend to compliment the non-retail compounding distribution model, with retail units embedded inside existing grocery businesses and through an online ecommerce model.

There will be three (3) operating divisions under the publicly traded holding company. The first, expected to be named TN Retail, LLC would hold its retail storefront operations which would provide conventional pharmacy products and unique compounding based solutions. The store would focus on healthy, holistic and natural solutions, along the lines of a Whole Foods of Pharmacy -style marketing approach which would become the feeder system for sale to the Companys expected compounding production facilities.

The second anticipated separate subsidiary would hold its compounding pharmacy, back office production and central fill operations and is expected to be named TN Compounding, LLC. This would be a 503a licensed operation initially, although the Companys management envisions a network of these facilities located regionally. It may eventually consider a 503b licensed operation to accommodate the ability to provide both sterile and non-sterile products, including products for stocking inventory at medical offices and hospitals.

Lastly, the Company expects to acquire unique related technologies, including a growing library of specialized formulations. Many of these formulations are expected to be unique to its operations, and some may be licensed to others for mass market distribution, or may be produced for stocking inventory at a 503b qualified facility. The entity is expected to be named TN Technologies, LLC and will hold those intellectual property assets, as well as other novel new approaches it may engage in, directly, or under a license granted from the holders.

The Company intends to target compounders who have a) strong regulatory compliance history, b) a record of profitable operations, c) operations that represent a geographical hub or spoke when considered in relation to other compounders, and d) where the combination of operations including embedded retail, and online, facilitates cross selling of a growing line of products. 
 
10

We believe the pharmacy industry, and especially compounding pharmacy, can easily be described as having multiple flavors. We believe the markets for both people and pets are both underserved:
 

a. | Some sell basic OTC medications and provide delivery only, and most users rely on insurance reimbursement for payment; 
b. | Some are value added resellers, using OTC recognized medications, then repackaging, or using combinations, to personalize the product for the client. While vet based is a cash business, the human side is largely insurance reliant; 
c. | Some are like OEM manufacturers, like a generic drug maker, starting with basic, non-productized materials, and creating both standard and fully customized novel formulations for specific maladies and needs. These are more often cash clients, and this approach is well accepted in the pet area, and becoming more accepted for people as alternatives to OTC, and for cash buyers seeking lower cost;
d. | We believe a mix of these can serve the need to drive costs down, and allow innovative approaches to improve patient results. 

 
The pet business is an area of focus. A recent research document, Research from Federal Trade Commission: Pet Medications, May 2015, (which can be found on our web site at: http://truenaturepharma.com/links/) noted the following:
 

a. | According to one estimate, in 2014 veterinarians accounted for 58 percent of sales of pet medications, with brick and mortar retailers accounting for 28 percent and Internet/mail order retailers accounting for 13 percent; 
b. | Approximately 65 percent of U.S. households own pets, the most common being dogs and cats, which equates to 79.7 million homes; 
c. | In 2014, Americans spent approximately $58 billion on their pets, including food, supplies, veterinary care, prescription and over the counter medication and other pet services and products. This figure represents tremendous growth since 2001, when comparable expenditures totaled $28.5 billion;
d. | In 2013, retail sales of prescription and non-prescription medications for dogs and cats was estimated at $7.6 billion. U.S. retail sales of companion animal pet medications are expected to grow to $10.2 billion by 2018, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of circa 5 percent; 
e. | U.S. manufacturer sales of companion animal pet medications have been estimated at $3.7 billion to $4 billion annually. 

Industry Overview

The following information was taken from this report on the Compounding Industry: IBISWorld Industry Report OD5706 Compounding Pharmacies in the U.S., dated January 2015 by Sarah Turk. A copy of this report is available for download from our web site at: http://truenaturepharma.com/links.
Industry Definition

This industry includes stores that make and sell compounded medications that are not commercially available. Compounded medications are prescriptions that are prescribed and written by physicians and prepared by pharmacists for individual patients.
 

11

Executive Summary

Despite the Compounding Pharmacies industry experiencing negative media attention from contaminated compounded prescriptions, it has still proved to be a business with a loyal customer base. Compounded medications can assist patients compliance with their medication due to offering medication tastes, routes of administration, and medication dosages that were not otherwise commercially available. Moreover, the burgeoning elderly population has stimulated demand for prescriptions, including compounded medications that were customized to address a patients needs. From October to September 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected approximately 150 compounding pharmacies, with 90.0% of facilities inspected having problems. As a result, some industry operators have exited the industry altogether or have contended with costs related to complying with FDA standards. The industry has benefited from pharmaceutical manufacturers having drug shortages, enabling the industry to access raw materials and supply medication orders to patients and hospitals. As group purchasing organizations (GPOs), which secure supplies for healthcare providers, control about 72.0% of purchases made by hospitals, according to the Healthcare Supply Chain Association, drug shortages have occurred. Due to GPOs using their market share as leverage to secure low-cost contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some drug makers did not have the incentive to manufacture and stock essential drugs.
 
As a result, industry revenue is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% to $5.6 billion during the five years to 2015, including 7.3% growth in 2015. This growth has been driven by the number of active drug shortages increasing from 328 in 2010 to 361 in 2013, according to the latest data available from the United States Government Accountability Office. Profit is anticipated to rise from 25.7% of industry revenue in 2010 to 26.5% in 2015, due to the prescription shortage and lack of substitutes for industry products enabling the industry to garner higher prices. During the five years to 2020, industry revenue is forecast to grow at an annualized rate of 2.6% to $6.4 billion. As the number of physician visits is expected to rise, more individuals will likely be prescribed medications, which may stimulate demand for compounded pharmaceuticals. Overall, the size of this growth will be contingent on how many patients require medications with alternative dosages and strengths.
 
Key External Drivers

Number of pets (cats and dogs): In addition to developing drug compounds for humans, compounding pharmacies also create specialized drugs compounded for animals. As the number of pets increases, demand for compounding pharmacies rises, as many pet owners will purchase compounded medications to increase animal compliance with alternative routes of administration.
Regulation

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is encouraging large-scale operators to register with the FDA and is increasing federal regulations. As healthcare providers are increasingly purchasing compounded medications from FDA-registered and regulated facilities, many operators will choose to comply with regulations to bolster revenue volumes. Regulation is expected to increase in 2015, which represents a potential threat to the industry.

Current Performance 

During the past five years, the Compounding Pharmacies industry has exhibited growth, thanks to an increase in the number of dispensed prescriptions. As the burgeoning elderly population has dealt with a number of chronic illnesses that require medication, demand for compounded pharmaceuticals has risen. For example, patients have used compounded prescriptions to access medications in alternative dosages, routes of administration, ingredients (due to patient allergies) and flavorings than drugs that were commercially available. Moreover, the shortage or termination of prescriptions from drug manufacturers product portfolio has stimulated demand for compounded prescriptions. In the five years to 2015, industry revenue is anticipated to increase at an annualized rate of 2.4% to $5.6 billion, including 7.3% growth in 2015, due to a rise in the number of prescription shortages. For example, according to data from the United States Government Accountability Office, the number of active drug shortages has increased from 328 in 2010 to 361 in 2013 (latest data available), which has benefited some compounding pharmacies because they were able to supply drugs to hospitals and patients that may have otherwise come from another source. Profit is expected to increase from 25.7% of industry revenue in 2010 to 26.5% in 2015, due to the prescription shortage enabling operators to markup industry product prices.
Growing Opportunity

Nevertheless, the burgeoning elderly population has provided a driver for the industry. The number of adults aged 65 and older is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 3.4% during the five years to 2020. More elderly patients have visited their physician, which has stimulated demand for prescriptions. Because the burgeoning elderly population has required more prescriptions to address their numerous chronic illnesses, demand for compounded pharmaceuticals has grown. For example, as the number of stroke patients rose, so did the prevalence of dysphagia, or a patients inability to swallow. Because of this trend, demand for compounded medications with alternative routes of administration increased. Additionally, the industry also provides compounded medications for pets. The number of pet owners is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 2.3% during the five years to 2020. Because of this growth, more pet owners will be required to obtain compounded drugs to increase their pets compliance with medications. For example, pet owners may demand compounded drugs to cater to their pets individualized needs, such as allergies and complications with the drugs route of administration.
Competition

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. There are competitors in the United States that are currently selling FDA- approved products that our products would compete with if and when approved by the FDA.
 
In addition to product safety, development and efficacy, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical market include product quality and price, reputation, service and access to scientific and technical information. It is possible that developments by our competitors will make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, the intensely competitive environment of the pain management products requires an ongoing, extensive search for medical and technological innovations and the ability to market products effectively, including the ability to communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of branded products for their intended uses to healthcare professionals in private practice, group practices and managed care organizations. Because we are smaller than our competitors, we may lack the financial and other resources needed to develop, produce, distribute, market and commercialize any of our drug candidates or compete for market share in the pain management sector.

Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices, including, among others: federal, state and local licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2012 (collectively, the Health Reform Law); statutes and regulations of the FDA, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable state agencies concerning the sale, advertisement and promotion of the products we sell. Below are descriptions of some of the various federal and state laws and regulations which may govern or impact our current and planned operations.
 
Our ongoing product development activities are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation at both the federal and state levels. Post development, the manufacture, testing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sales and marketing of our products is also subject to extensive regulation. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1983, as amended, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacture, safety, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, refusal of the government to approve New Drug Applications, or NDAs, civil sanctions and criminal prosecution.
 
FDA approval is typically required before each dosage form or strength of any new drug can be marketed. Applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to efficacy, safety, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling, and quality control. The FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework requires a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources.
 
Current FDA standards for approving new pharmaceutical products are more stringent than those that were applied in the past. As a result, labeling revisions, formulation or manufacturing changes and/or product modifications may be necessary. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations or legal interpretations, when and if promulgated, may have on our business in the future. Changes could, among other things, require expanded or different labeling, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation. Such regulatory changes, or new legislation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The evolving and complex nature of regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that from time to time, we will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite ongoing efforts and commitment to achieve and maintain full compliance with all regulatory requirements.
 
Quality Assurance Requirements

The FDA enforces regulations to ensure that the methods used in, and facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP. The cGMP regulations the FDA enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of operations, from receipt of raw materials to finished product distribution, insofar as they bear upon whether drugs meet all the identity, strength, quality, purity and safety characteristics required of them. To assure compliance requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas.

The FDA conducts pre-approval inspections of facilities engaged in the development, manufacture, processing, packing, testing and holding of the drugs subject to NDAs. If the FDA concludes that the facilities to be used do not meet cGMP, good laboratory practices or good clinical practices requirements, it will not approve the NDA. Corrective actions to remedy the deficiencies must be performed and verified in a subsequent inspection. In addition, manufacturers of both pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients used to formulate the drug also ordinarily undergo a pre-approval inspection, although the inspection can be waived when the manufacturer has had a passing cGMP inspection in the immediate past. Failure of any facility to pass a pre-approval inspection will result in delayed approval and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of facilities to assess their cGMP status. If the FDA were to find serious cGMP non-compliance during such an inspection, it could take regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The FDA could initiate product seizures, request product recalls and seek to enjoin a products manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to civil penalties and criminal prosecutions. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a company is not in compliance with cGMP requirements, sanctions may be imposed that include preventing us from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying the company as an unacceptable supplier, thereby disqualifying us from selling products to federal agencies. Imported active pharmaceutical ingredients and other components needed to manufacture our products could be rejected by United States Customs.

Other FDA Matters

If there are any modifications to an approved drug, including changes in indication, manufacturing process or labeling or a change in a manufacturing facility, an applicant must notify the FDA, and in many cases, approval for such changes must be submitted to the FDA or other regulatory authority. Additionally, the FDA regulates post-approval promotional labeling and advertising activities to assure that such activities are being conducted in conformity with statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to adhere to such requirements can result in regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Pharmacy Regulation

Our planned target pharmacy acquisitions will be regulated by both individual states and the federal government. Every state has laws and regulations addressing pharmacy operations, including regulations relating specifically to compounding pharmacy operations. These regulations generally include licensing requirements for pharmacists and pharmacies, as well as regulations related to compounding processes, safety protocols, purity, sterility, storage, controlled substances, recordkeeping and regular inspections, among other things. State rules and regulations are updated periodically, generally under the jurisdiction of individual state boards of pharmacy. Failure to comply with the state pharmacy regulations of a particular state could result in a pharmacy being prohibited from operating in that state, financial penalties and/or becoming subject to additional oversight from that states board of pharmacy. In addition, many states are considering imposing, or have already begun to impose, more stringent requirements on compounding pharmacies. If our pharmacy operations become subject to additional licensure requirements, are unable to maintain their required licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on pharmacies, our ability to operate in some states could be limited, which may have an adverse impact on our business.
 
Many of the states into which we plan to deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out-of-state pharmacies to register with, or be licensed by, the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states. These states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located. However, various state pharmacy boards have enacted laws and/or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out-of-state pharmacies by, among other things, requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out-of-state pharmacy dispenses medications, whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located, or requiring the pharmacist-in-charge to be licensed in that state.

Furthermore, under federal law, Section 503A of the Federal Food Drug Cosmetic Act (FDCA) seeks to limit the amount of compounded products that a pharmacy can dispense interstate. The interpretation and enforcement of that provision is dependent on the FDA entering into a standard Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each state setting forth limits on interstate compounding. The FDA has stated in guidance issued in February 2015 that it will not enforce interstate restrictions until after it publishes a final standard MOU and has made it available to the states for signature for some designated period of time. The FDA has proposed a 180-day period for states to agree to the standard MOU after the final version is presented to states. Until a final MOU is issued and presented to the states to consider whether to sign, the extent of such interstate dispensing restrictions imposed by Section 503A is unknown. If the final standard MOU is not signed by a particular state, then interstate shipments of compounded preparations from a pharmacy located in that state would be limited to quantities not greater than 5% total prescription orders dispensed or distributed by such pharmacy. The current draft standard MOU presented by the FDA in February 2015 would limit interstate shipments of compounded drug units to 30% of all compounded and non-compounded units dispensed or distributed by the pharmacy per month. If the final standard MOU contains a 30% limit on interstate distribution, or if the FDA applies the 5% limit in Section 503A because a state refuses to sign the MOU, then those limitations could have an adverse effect our operations.
 
Certain provisions of the FDCA govern the preparation, handling, storage, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA) clarifies and strengthens the federal regulatory framework governing compounding pharmacies. Title 1 of the DQSA, the Compounding Quality Act, modifies provisions of the Section 503A of the FDCA that were found to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002. In general, Section 503A provides that pharmacies are exempt from the provisions of the FDCA requiring compliance with cGMP, labeling with adequate directions for use and FDA approval prior to marketing if the pharmacy complies with certain other requirements. Among other things, to comply with Section 503A, a compounded drug must be compounded by a licensed pharmacist for an identified individual patient based on a valid prescription. Pharmacies may only compound in limited quantities before receipt of a prescription for an individual patient, and Section 503A limits the distribution of compounded drug products outside of the state in which the pharmacy is located, as described in the previous paragraph. 503A also provides certain requirements for compounding from bulk substances and prohibits compounding of products that have been withdrawn from the market for reasons of safety or efficacy and products that are demonstrably difficult to compound.

Confidentiality, Privacy and HIPAA

Our pharmacy operations will involve the receipt, use and disclosure of confidential medical, pharmacy and other health-related information. The federal privacy regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) are designed to protect the medical information of a healthcare patient or health plan enrollee that could be used to identify the individual. Among other things, HIPAA limits certain uses and disclosures of protected health information and requires compliance with federal security regulations regarding the storage, utilization of, access to and transmission of electronic protected health information. In 2009, the Health Information for Economic and Clinical Health Act modified certain provisions of HIPAA to strengthen its privacy and security provisions. The requirements imposed by HIPAA are extensive. In addition, most states have enacted privacy and security laws that protect identifiable patient information that is not health-related. Further, several states have enacted more protective and comprehensive pharmacy-related privacy legislation that not only applies to patient records but also prohibits the transfer or use for commercial purposes of pharmacy data that identifies prescribers. These regulations impose substantial requirements on covered entities and their business associates regarding the storage, utilization of, access to and transmission of personal health and non-health information. Many of these laws apply to our planned business.

Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement

Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance coverage for qualified persons age 65 or older and for some disabled persons with certain specific conditions. State-funded Medicaid programs provide medical benefits to groups of low-income and disabled individuals, some of whom may have inadequate or no medical insurance. Currently, most of our commercially available formulations are sold in cash transactions and our customers may choose to seek available reimbursement opportunities to the extent that they exist. We are currently in communications with third-party public and private payors regarding potential reimbursement options for certain of our proprietary formulations and we have begun hiring public and private payor billers in anticipation of the potential reimbursement opportunities for certain formulations. However, third-party payors, including Medicare, are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing, in some cases, to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted labeling approval. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amended PPACA (collectively, the Health Reform Law), will result in sweeping changes to the existing U.S. system for the delivery and financing of health care and may have a considerable impact on our business. Thus, we may be unable to satisfy the requirements of Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors and we may never be able to obtain reimbursement from such payors for any of our formulations. To the extent we obtain third-party reimbursement for our compounded formulations, we may become subject to Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plan regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims.
Management

We believe that True Natures management will remain small in the near term, and will consist of a four-person management team with experience in 1) public company accounting and finance, 2) multi-unit supply chain management including retail and wholesale operations, 3) brand marketing aimed at the consumer through online and traditional retail channels, and 4) public equities financing. We believe our current team address most of those areas, and we anticipate further additions as our size, and funding, will allow. Biographical and other information on our executive officers and directors is set forth in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance of this Report.
 
Impact of JOBS Act

On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act) was enacted into law. Under the JOBS Act, Congress established a new statutorily defined category of registrant referred to as an emerging growth company (EGC) which, among other things, affords such registrants with relief from certain disclosure requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) for so long as they continue to qualify as an EGC.
 
A registrant qualifies as an EGC if it has total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion as of the end of its most recent completed fiscal year and has not filed for its initial public offering of common equity securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) prior to December 9, 2011. Under this definition, we qualify as an EGC.
 

17

For so long as we qualify as an EGC: 


● | We will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation over internal control requirements under §404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”). 
● | We may elect to comply with the following scaled-back executive compensation disclosure requirements (“Reduced Executive Compensation Disclosures”): (a) EGCs are not required to comply with the annual say on pay and say on golden parachute advisory voting requirements and rules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), (b) EGCs are not required to include the disclosures that will be required under future rules to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act as to the relationship between executive compensation and company performance, and the ratio of CEO pay to median employee pay, and (c) EGCs may elect to provide the same level of executive compensation disclosures as required by Smaller Reporting Companies (as defined under Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act and referred to herein as SRCs), which includes, among other things, the omission of Compensation Disclosure and Analysis discussion, inclusion of fewer tables, and disclosure of compensation for only the CEO and the two next highest paid officers.
● | We may elect on a one-time basis not to comply with new or revised accounting principles that apply to public companies, as long as we comply once the rules become applicable for private companies. We are required to make an irrevocable election which will continue for so long as we retain our status as an EGC status. 
● | We will not be required to comply with any Public Company Accounting Oversight Board rules regarding mandatory audit firm rotation and auditor discussion and analysis should such rules be adopted. 

 
As an EGC, we are not required to take advantage of all the benefits made available to us under the JOBS Act described above, but may instead opt-in to certain of those scaled-back disclosures and phased-in requirements as we so desire. However, as discussed above, we are not permitted to selectively opt-in with respect to compliance with new or revised accounting rules or pronouncements. Accordingly, we have irrevocably elected to opt out of compliance with any new or revised accounting principles until any such rules become applicable to private companies.
 
Under the JOBS Act, we will retain our status as an EGC until the earliest of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as may be adjusted under the JOBS Act) or more; (2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (3) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. It should be noted that we also currently qualify as a Small Reporting Company (SRC). Thus, if we are no longer an EGC, we will continue to be exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of SOX and eligible to comply with the Reduced Executive Compensation Disclosures for so long as we qualify as a SRC. We also may elect to provide other scaled-back disclosures applicable to SRCs (not just those relating to Reduced Executive Compensation Disclosures).
