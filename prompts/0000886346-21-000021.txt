Description of Our Business
We are a global supplier of high-value, critical components and engineered systems used in process industries worldwide. Our products, technologies, and services play an integral role in enhancing process efficiency, optimizing energy utilization, and maximizing productivity in resource-intensive industries. Our operations are comprised of three reportable operating segments, Flow Control, Industrial Processing, and Material Handling.
We have a long and well-established history of developing, manufacturing, and servicing a range of products and equipment used in process industries such as paper, packaging, and tissue; wood products; mining; metals; food processing; and recycling and waste management, among others. Some of our businesses or their predecessor companies have been in operation for more than 100 years. Our diverse customer base includes global and regional industrial manufacturers and distributors who participate in the broader resource transformation sector. We believe we have one of the largest installed bases of equipment in the markets we serve around the globe. 
We expect that a significant driver of our growth over the next several years will be the acquisition of businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing products and services or may involve entry into a new process industry. We continue to pursue acquisition opportunities. See Note 2, Acquisitions, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details of our recent acquisitions. 
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and resulted in significant travel and transport restrictions, which adversely affected our bookings and results of operations for a substantial part of 2020. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting economic impact, continues to evolve and we are closely monitoring its impact on all aspects of our business and will continue to take actions that are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and stakeholders.
Business Segments and Products
We previously reported our financial results by combining operating entities into three reportable operating segments: Papermaking Systems, Wood Processing Systems, and Material Handling Systems, and a separate product line, Fiber-based Products. During the first quarter of 2020, we changed our reportable operating segments to better align with our strategic initiatives to grow both organically and through acquisitions. See Note 12, Business Segment and Geographical Information, in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding our segments. Accordingly, we describe our business and products below in our three new reportable operating segments: Flow Control, Industrial Processing, and Material Handling.
