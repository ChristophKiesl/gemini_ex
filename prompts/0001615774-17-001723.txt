Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a provider of next generation physical and virtual payment services that we introduced to the Mexican market in the third quarter of 2014. We have a ten-year renewable exclusive license agreement for the use of technology that can be used to perform services that are similar to services that have been successfully deployed with this technology in several European, Asian, North and South American countries.
 
We provide an integrated network of kiosks, terminals and payment channels that enable consumers to deposit cash, convert it into a digital form and remit the funds to any merchant in our network quickly and securely. We help consumers and merchants connect more efficiently in markets and consumer segments, such as Mexico, that are largely cash-based and lack convenient alternatives for consumers to pay for goods and services in physical, online and mobile environments. For example, we license technology that can be used to pay bills, add minutes to mobile phones, purchase transportation tickets, shop online, buy digital services or send money to third parties.
 
Our current focus is on Mexico which remains a cash-dominated society for retail consumer payments with approximately 80% of the value of personal payments exchanged in cash (Bank of Mexico). The penetration of electronic payment services, such as credit and debit cards and point of sale terminals, significantly lags behind more developed economies. We believe that opportunities for our services in Mexico are vast. With over 109 million mobile subscribers in Mexico, 85% of which are under prepaid plans, mobile top-up alone, was a $12 billion business in 2014 as reported by PwC Telecom in Mexico 2015, America Móvil 4Q’15. We believe that there is opportunity for growth in the Mexican market and have expanded to service providers beyond the mobile telephone operators to service provides of electricity, transportation, utilities, municipal services and taxes, consumer credit installments, insurance premiums, and many more. Altogether as of the first quarter of 2017 our platform had integrated 130 such services.
 
Our primary strategy in Mexico to date has been the attraction of additional service providers, the sale of self-service kiosks across multiple verticals and the deployment of kiosks through Redpag Electrónicos, our kiosk management subsidiary. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, QPAGOS generated net revenues of $2,691,896 and $1,127,944, respectively, from its operations in Mexico, and increase of 139%. QPAGOS primary source of revenue are fees it receives for processing payments made by consumers to service providers. We also generate revenue from non-payment services such as kiosk sales. QPAGOS currently has in excess of 130 service providers integrated into its payment gateway, which includes all mobile phone providers in Mexico as well as most utility companies, financial services, entertainment venues and others. As of December 31, 2016, QPAGOS deployed over 272 kiosks and terminals and services an additional 440 terminals of its independent distributors. QPAGOS kiosks and terminals can be found at convenience stores, next to metro stations, retail stores, airport terminals, education centers, and malls in major urban centers, as well as many small and rural towns.
 
In addition, QPAGOS has contracted for an electronic wallet which should enable consumers to hold balances in its kiosks for future use or to receive change. Launched in the first quarter of 2016 customers can now use cash and/or stored value in order to pay for goods and services across physical or virtual environments interchangeably. Also in the first quarter of 2016, QPAGOS launched our mobile app through which smart phone users can now access the exact menu of services available in our kiosks and make payments from the convenience of their phones. Cash is uploaded to the electronic wallet app via kiosks.
 
We believe that QPAGOS’ platform provides simple and intuitive user interfaces, convenient access and best-in-class services. QPAGOS runs its network and process its transactions using a proprietary, advanced technology platform that leverages the latest virtualization, analytics and security technologies to create a fast, highly reliable, secure and redundant system. We believe that the breadth and reach of this network, along with the proprietary nature of its technology platform, differentiate us from our competitors and allow us to effectively manage and update our services and realize significant operating leverage with growth in volumes.

History
 
QPAGOS was incorporated on September 25, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada originally under the name Asiya Pearls, Inc. On May 27, 2016, Asiya Pearls, Inc. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to QPAGOS.
 
Qpagos Corporation was incorporated on May 1, 2015 under the laws of Delaware under the name Qpagos Corporation as the holding company for two 99% owned operating subsidiaries, QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. and Redpag Electrónicos S.A.P.I. de C.V. Each of these entities were incorporated in November 2013 in Mexico.
 
QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. was formed to process payment transactions for service providers it contracts with, and Redpag Electrónicos S.A.P.I. de C.V. was formed to deploy and operate kiosks as a distributor.
 
On August 31, 2015, QPAGOS Corporation entered into various agreements with the shareholders of Qpagos and Redpag to give effect to a reverse merger transaction (the "Reverse Merger''). Pursuant to the Reverse Merger, the majority of the shareholders of Qpagos and Redpag effectively received shares in Qpagos Corporation, through various consulting and management agreements entered into with Qpagos Corporation and sold an effective 99.996% and 99.990% of the outstanding shares in Qpagos and Redpag, respectively to Qpagos Corporation. The series of transactions closed effective August 31, 2015. Upon the close of the Reverse Merger, Qpagos Corporation became the parent of Qpagos and Redpag and assumed the operations of these two companies as its sole business.
 
On May 12, 2016, QPAGOS entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Qpagos Corporation and QPAGOS Merge, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of QPAGOS (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 12, 2016 Qpagos Corporation and Merger Sub merged (the “Merger”), and Qpagos Corporation continued as the surviving corporation of the Merger and became a wholly owned subsidiary of QPAGOS. As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of Qpagos Corporation common stock was converted into the right to receive two shares of QPAGOS common stock as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we issued, and Qpagos Corporation stockholders received in a tax-free exchange, shares of our common stock such that Qpagos Corporation stockholders owned approximately 91% of our company immediately following the Merger. In addition, each outstanding warrant of Qpagos Corporation was assumed by us and converted into a warrant to acquire a number of shares of our common stock equal to twice the number of shares of common stock of Qpagos Corporation subject to the warrant immediately before the effective time of the Merger at an exercise price per share of Company common stock equal to 50% of the warrant exercise price for Qpagos Corporation common stock.
 
Corporate Information
 
Our principal offices are located at Paseo del la Reforma 404 Piso 15 PH, Col. Juarez, Del. Cuauhtemoc, Mexico, D.F. C.P. 06600, and our telephone number at that office is +52 (55) 55-110-110. We also have offices in the United States that are located at 1900 Glades Road, Suite 265, Boca Raton, Florida 33431. We maintain an Internet website at www.qpagos.com. Neither this website nor the information on this website is included or incorporated in, or is a part of, this Form 10-K.
Our Business Model
 
Our primary source of revenue are fees we receive for processing payments. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated $2,691,896 in net revenue, of which approximately $2,182,907 is net revenue derived from the operations of QPagos S.A.P.I. de C.V. and $508,989 is net revenue derived from the operations of Redpag. We earn a gross profit of approximately 7.5% on airtime sales on kiosks operated by Redpag and approximately 30% of the 7.5% gross profit on kiosks operated by third parties. We also earn commissions on payment services we provide to end-users through our kiosks and kiosks operated by third parties. This fee is either a transactional based fee of between USD$0.50 and USD$0.75 per transaction or a percentage of the transaction value. Certain service providers require that we receive the entire fee solely from the customers. 


Our agents (our distributors) buy the kiosks or terminals from us for approximately $6,000. The agent retains a portion of the fees that we derive from the service providers for services performed at the kiosks. Typically, 65% to 70% of the fees we receive from service providers are shared with the agent that has purchased the kiosk, and we retain 30-35% of such fees.

In addition, for certain high traffic public areas, such as malls and shopping centers, government agencies and large retailers who want to monetize high traffic areas, we pay the owner of the space a rental fee for the use of the space, and revenue share a smaller % of the commission, typically 10%.
 
Additionally, when a distributor integrates also their services into QPagos platform, for transactions done at their kiosks we may charge a transaction fee that may average $0.10, while that same transaction may generate up to $0.50 when done in other kiosks in Qpagos network. 
 
Partners-Service Providers
 
Our current focus has been on the prepaid mobile telephone market. In Mexico, 85% of the more than 109 million mobile subscribers are under prepaid programs, thus millions of people make payments into these plans on a frequent basis. We currently have integrated all mobile operators in Mexico into our active list of service providers, as well as 140 additional service providers, including major utilities. Additionally, QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V has integrated 9 of Mexico’s 32 states in its payment platform, and citizens of these states can now pay at our kiosks, municipal services, such as car registration, property taxes, traffic tickets, etc.
 
Our Distribution Network
 
QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V is developing a distribution network along several verticals, principally: (i) an agent network of independent businesses with high customer traffic in which our kiosks can be deployed; (ii) retailers that seek to decongest teller lines and shift service payments to self-service kiosks, (iii) banks and other financial intermediaries that want to extend geographic collection points to their customers, while also improving the experience of their customers when making payments at branches, (iv) government municipalities that want to bring service payments closer to their citizens; (v) other electronic payments distributors who we wholesale our services to, and (vi) our own distributor Redpag Electrónicos with its growing network in Mexico City and adjoining states.


Agents who own kiosks and terminals are responsible for placing, operating and servicing them in high-traffic, convenient retail locations. Several of our agents are mid-sized businesses which we believe provides them with insight into local market dynamics. The agency agreements that we enter into are usually for an indefinite term and may be unilaterally terminated by either party. Our agent contracts do not have exclusivity clauses. We usually cap these fees, and normally award the agents a percentage of the merchant fees. No one agent represented a material amount of our revenue, and we do not view ourselves as being dependent upon any one agent.
 
Our retail and institutional clients and prospects include large retail and convenient store chains, whose tellers are being congested by service payments and who would like to move these frequent transactions to the front of their stores. We are also in field trials with large financial institutions that want to expedite collections of their financial services as well as expand their hours of operation and geographic reach; and state, government and local municipalities that want to provide their citizens easy access to payments. For example, one of our principal customers has been Financiera AMIGA who in January 2017 added 30 more kiosks to the 56 they had already deployed for a total of 86 kiosks. Additionally, we are currently in trials with a 1,500 plus branch financial institution who is seeking to reduce banker fees, per transaction teller costs, and reduce lines by using our kiosks.


Research and Development Expenditure
 
We continuously develop our product offering and making technical improvements to our software, these expenses are incurred primarily as consulting fees paid to third party developers.
Marketing
 
We participate in several local events and exhibitions and provide promotional materials to distributors and retailers. We have also engaged in public relations campaigns geared towards corporate and institutional businesses, which has resulted in discussions with large box retailers such as Walmart, OXXO, Casa Ley, 7-Eleven, Circle K and several others. We have participated frequently in several International Franchising Exhibitions in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Puebla, Ciudad Juarez and Monterrey, and yearly in ANTAD Guadalajara Exhibition, the association that groups the country’s mayor retail chains.
Our Technology
 
We run our network and process our transactions using the proprietary, advanced technology platform that we license, which leverages the latest virtualization, analytics and security technologies to create a fast, highly reliable, secure and redundant system. We believe that the breadth and reach of our network, along with the proprietary nature of the technology platform that we license, differentiates us from our competitors and allow us to effectively manage and update our services and realize significant operating leverage with growth in volumes.
 
Localization and implementation of the different software and technology modules was supported through a Localization Agreement with Janor Enterprises, Ltd. Since December 2015 source code and administration rights have been fully transferred to Qpagos. As of today, we have our own team of 8 IT engineers in Mexico City and Moscow that are in control of the software and developing gateways and updates on an ongoing basis.

On August 1, 2014, Qpagos Corporation entered into a license agreement with Janor for the rights to use three software programs (the “Programs”): RG Payment Switch (designed to transfer payments to providers of services), RG Processing (designed for processing and counting of payments) and RG Kiosk (designed for performance of payments through payment collection equipment functioning in the self-service kiosks) to be used in Mexico. The Agreement was amended on November 1, 2015 to provide that subject to our payment of $5,000 per quarter, that neither Janor nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliated entities will install a terminal and/or kiosk that incorporates the Programs or a technology having the same or a similar effect nor will they provide any person or entity with the right to install a terminal and/or kiosk in Mexico that incorporates the Programs or a technology having the same or a similar effect. The term of the Agreement is for 10 years subject to an additional 10 year term so long as we are not in breach of any terms of the Agreement.


Under this agreement Janor is obligated to provide us with rights to use software updates developed by Janor. The ten-year term commences on the date of full payment of the localization contract which took place November 20, 2015. Janor retains exclusive rights to any intellectual property, including any addition, alteration, program updating, derivative or composed creation, obtained in the process of usage of the programs. The payment for the rights granted under the license is a total of $1,000, payable in annual payments of $100 per year over ten years and is in addition to the payments that we make under the Localization Agreement. The agreement provides, among other things, that we will pay the fee, ensure confidentiality of commercial and technical information received when performing the agreement and inform Janor of any changes in its structure. Janor has a right to terminate the agreement if we breach the terms of the agreement or do not properly perform or if we do not cure any breach or nonperformance within 30 days of receipt of notice of termination. If Janor suffers any damages, they are entitled to request compensation from us. The rights to use the Programs terminate upon termination of the Agreement.

Competition
 
The payment services industry is highly competitive, and our continued growth depends on our ability to compete effectively. Although we do not face direct competition from any competitor in exactly the same line of business, as no major self-service electronic payment kiosk vendors exists in Mexico today, we face competition from teller-assisted operations at a variety of financial and non-financial business groups, including a few small regional players. These competitors include retail banks, non-traditional payment service providers, such as retailers and mobile network operators, traditional kiosk and terminal operators and electronic payment system operators, as well as other companies that provide various forms of payment services, including electronic payment and payment processing services. Competitors in our industry seek to differentiate themselves by features and functionalities such as speed, convenience, network size, accessibility, hours of operation, reliability and price. A significant number of our competitors have greater financial, technological and marketing resources than we have, operate robust networks and could decide to develop their own self-service kiosks solutions instead of buying from Qpagos.
 
We believe that the most serious competition comes from bricks and mortar locations since the bulk of the mobile top-up business is done at major retail chains such as Walmart, Soriana, Chedraui and convenience stores such as OXXO and 7-Eleven. For example, Monterrey-based OXXO, owned by Coca-Cola bottler FEMSA, with over 14,000 stores is the largest retailer network in Mexico with daily visits of over 8 million people. Because of this high concentration of customers, OXXO has become one of the primary destinations to top up prepaid phones as well as paying utility bills and other services. These brick and mortar retailers are also our key target market for QPAGOS as they are experiencing congestion at their in-person teller operations and are also exploring the alternative of expediting payments through the use of self-service kiosks. We are currently in dialogues with several of these retailers which want to address teller congestion caused by the large number of customers seeking to make bill payments which affects both their customers and their core business as a retailer.
 
Seasonality
 
We do not expect that our business will experience significant seasonality.

Government and Environmental Regulation and Laws
 
Currently our business is not impacted by government regulation. We may in the future be subject to a variety of regulations aimed at preventing money laundering and financing criminal activity and terrorism, financial services regulations, payment services regulations, consumer protection laws, currency control regulations, advertising laws and privacy and data protection laws and therefore expect to experience periodic investigations by various regulatory authorities in connection with the same, which may sometimes result in monetary or other sanctions being imposed on us. Many of these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and are often unclear and inconsistent with other applicable laws and regulations, making compliance challenging and increasing our related operating costs and legal risks. In particular, there has been increased public attention and heightened legislation and regulations regarding money laundering and terrorist financing. We may have to make significant judgment calls in applying anti-money laundering legislation and risk being found in non-compliance with such laws.
 
If local authorities in Mexico choose to enforce specific interpretations of the applicable legislation that differ from ours or enact new laws, we may be found to be in violation and subject to penalties or other liabilities. This could also limit our ability in effecting such payments going forward and may increase our cost of doing business.
 
In addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding future legislation on taxation of electronic payments in Mexico, including the place where taxation may be generated. Subsequent legislation and regulation and interpretations thereof, litigation, court rulings, or other events could expose us to increased costs, liability and reputational damage that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, Qpagos Corporation had 2 full time employees, which are its chief executive officer and chief operating officer, and 31 full-time contractors provided to it by an outsourcing company and designated to perform services for its Mexican subsidiaries Qpagos and Redpag. Qpagos Corporation had no part-time employees. None of these employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Qpagos Corporation does not have employment agreements with any employees other than its Chief Executive Officer, Gaston Pereira and its Chief Operating Officer, Andrey Novikov. See “Executive Compensation.” Qpagos Corporation also enters into consulting arrangements for IT and operational services.
