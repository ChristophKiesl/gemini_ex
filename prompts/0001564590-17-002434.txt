Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to developing and commercializing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system, or CNS, disorders, where there are no approved therapies or existing therapies are inadequate. We have a portfolio of product candidates with a current focus on modulating two critical CNS receptor systems, GABA and NMDA.  The GABA receptor family, which is recognized as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, mediates downstream neurologic and bodily function via activation of GABAA receptors.  The NMDA-type receptors of the glutamate receptor system are a major excitatory receptor system in the CNS.  Dysfunction in these systems is implicated in a broad range of CNS disorders.  We are targeting CNS indications where patient populations are easily identified, clinical endpoints are well-defined, and development pathways are feasible.
 Our lead product candidate, SAGE-547 (brexanolone USAN), is a proprietary intravenous, or IV, formulation of allopregnanolone, a naturally occurring neuroactive steroid that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, including both synaptic and extrasynaptic populations. We are currently conducting Phase 3 clinical trials of SAGE-547 in both super-refractory status epilepticus, or SRSE, and post-partum depression, or PPD.
 Our Phase 3 clinical trial in SRSE, known as the STATUS Trial, is evaluating SAGE-547 as a potential adjunctive therapy in the treatment of SRSE.  SRSE is a rare and life-altering condition in which a patient experiences a state of continuous seizure called status epilepticus, or SE, that continues or recurs despite standard treatment regimens normally sufficient to stop the seizure activity.  We expect to report top-line results from the STATUS Trial in the first half of 2017.  If successful, we believe the results from this Phase 3 clinical trial, together with other data from the SAGE-547 development program will be sufficient to form the basis of a New Drug Application, or NDA, submission to the FDA seeking approval for SAGE-547 in SRSE in the U.S. Based on scientific advice we received in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, we also believe our current Phase 3 clinical program in SRSE, if successful, will be sufficient to support a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the EMA seeking approval of SAGE-547 for SRSE in the European Union, or EU.
 Our Phase 3 clinical program in PPD is evaluating SAGE-547 as a potential treatment for PPD.  PPD is a distinct and readily identified major depressive disorder that is a biological complication of childbirth, affecting a subset of women typically commencing in the third trimester of pregnancy or within four weeks after giving birth.  We anticipate announcing top-line data from the Phase 3 clinical program, known as the Hummingbird Study, encompassing two placebo-controlled trials, in the second half of 2017.  In the third quarter of 2016, we received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA for SAGE-547 as a potential treatment for PPD. Based on input we received from the FDA during a Breakthrough Therapy meeting in the fourth quarter of 2016, we believe that, if successful, the results of the Phase 3 clinical program, together with the results of prior clinical studies of SAGE-547 in PPD, and ongoing non-clinical studies, will be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA to the FDA seeking approval for SAGE-547 in PPD.   In the fourth quarter of 2016, we also received PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation from the EMA for SAGE-547 in the treatment of PPD.
 Our most advanced next-generation product candidate is SAGE-217, a novel neuroactive steroid that, like SAGE-547, is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, targeting both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated our Phase 2 clinical program for SAGE-217 with a focus on four indications: two movement disorder indications, essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, and two mood disorder indications, major depressive disorder, or MDD, and PPD.  In February 2017, we announced top-line results from the open-label, proof-of-concept portion (Part A) of our Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-217 in MDD which met our criteria for advancing SAGE-217 into the blinded, placebo-controlled portion of the Phase 2 MDD clinical trial (Part B).  We expect to initiate Part B in the second quarter of 2017.  We are also currently conducting the Phase 2 clinical trials of SAGE-217 in PPD, essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease. We expect to report top-line results from the open-label portion of the Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-217 in Parkinson's disease in the first half of 2017.  We anticipate reporting top-line results from the blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trials of SAGE-217 in essential tremor and PPD in the second half of 2017.  We also have a portfolio of other novel compounds that target the GABAA receptors, including SAGE-105, SAGE-324 and SAGE-689, which are at earlier stages of development with a focus on both acute and chronic CNS disorders.

Our second area of focus is the development of novel compounds that target the NMDA receptor. The first product candidate selected for development from this program is SAGE-718, an oxysterol-based positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor.  Our initial areas of focus for development of SAGE-718 will be cerebrosterol deficit disorders, Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis, and other indications involving NMDA receptor hypofunction. We believe measuring levels of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies or decreased levels of cerebrosterol, a naturally occurring oxysterol, may represent biomarkers to identify, for future study, broader patient populations characterized by cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptoms resulting from NMDA receptor dysfunction or hypofunction. Examples of these potential areas for future evaluation include certain types, aspects or subpopulations of a number of diseases such as depression, Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, Huntington’s disease, and neuropathic pain. We have completed Investigational New Drug, or IND-enabling non-clinical studies of SAGE-718, and plan to commence the Phase 1 clinical program in the first half of 2017.
 We expect to continue our focus on allosteric modulation of the GABAA and NMDA receptor systems in the brain. The GABAA and NMDA receptor systems are broadly accepted as impacting many psychiatric and neurological disorders, spanning disorders of mood, seizure, cognition, anxiety, sleep, pain, epilepsy, and movement disorders, among others. We believe that we will have the opportunity to develop molecules from our internal portfolio with the goal of addressing a number of these disorders in the future. Our ability to identify and develop such novel CNS therapies is enabled by our proprietary chemistry platform that is centered, as a starting point, on knowledge of the chemical scaffolds of certain endogenous neuroactive steroids. We believe our knowledge of the chemistry and activity of allosteric modulators allows us to efficiently design molecules with different characteristics.  This diversity enables us to regulate important properties such as half-life, brain penetration and receptor pharmacology to develop product candidates that have the potential for better selectivity, increased tolerability, and fewer off-target side effects than either current CNS therapies or previous therapies which have failed in development.

Understanding the Foundations of Our Approach
 Neurotransmission
 The CNS is composed of a vast and complex network of different structures and cell types, most of which serve directly or indirectly, to provide a means for the nervous system to signal or communicate with other nerve cells in order to regulate and control all brain function. The cell type responsible for this signaling is called a neuron. One way chemical or electrical signals exert their effects on neurons is by traveling across a physical gap located between two neurons, called a synapse. Presynaptic neurons transmit signals whereas postsynaptic neurons react to the signals. The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each having 
 2


hundreds to tens of thousands of synapses to allow for this communication. This process is essential to all things, from organ function, to movement, to memory and all behavioral processes.
 Neurotransmission is the process by which signaling molecules, called neurotransmitters, are released by a presynaptic neuron, travel over the synaptic space and bind to and interact with receptors on a postsynaptic neuron. Depending on the nature of the neurotransmitter and receptor, this interaction results in excitation, inhibition or modulation of the receiving neuron’s behavior.
 Synaptic receptors are primarily located inside the synaptic cleft, or the space where the neurons communicate, and have been historically considered to be the most important part of the neuron. However, recent understanding of neurotransmission and brain function has shown there are many extrasynaptic receptors that also respond to neurotransmitters to exert their effects. For example, it is becoming increasingly understood that extrasynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated neurotransmission is critical to generalized neurological function and has demonstrated influence over general physiological states such as sleep, hunger, anxiety and seizure, among other things.
 Allosteric Modulation
 We are focused on developing drugs based on selective allosteric modulation of key CNS synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. Molecules that function directly on synaptic or extrasynaptic receptors at the site where the native, or natural, molecule binds to inhibit or activate them are known as orthosteric molecules. Alternatively, allosteric modulators are a class of small molecules very different from classical orthosteric drugs, as allosteric modulators interact at a site different from the native site and allow the potential for fine-tuning of neuronal signals.
 Orthosteric drugs aimed at key synaptic receptors typically have a targeted effect of complete activation or complete inhibition of the neuron, with little subtlety in how they exert their effect. As a result, neurons may be unable to respond to normal stimuli, and can become over-stimulated by a neurotransmitter or be unable to respond to normal neurotransmission, thus potentially negatively impacting both the efficacy and safety profile of an orthosteric CNS drug development candidate. We believe that nowhere in the body is it more important to maintain normal rhythms than in the brain, and accordingly we believe that allosteric modulation approaches are well-suited for the treatment of CNS diseases and disorders.
 We utilize our proprietary chemistry capabilities to design and identify drugs that are allosteric modulators that bind to either or both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors, and that have properties targeted to the indications of interest. Our goal is to select for development compounds that we believe are capable of varying degrees of desired activity rather than complete activation or inhibition of the receptor as is typically observed with orthosteric drugs. Our current focus is on developing compounds that are positive allosteric modulators of both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites of either the GABAA receptor or the NMDA receptor system.
 Allosteric Modulation of Extrasynaptic GABAA Receptors
 GABAA receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the human brain, playing a key role in reducing neuron excitability. Our initial focus is on the development of positive allosteric modulators of both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites of the GABAA receptor. Benzodiazepines, or BDZs, are allosteric modulators that primarily act at a particular receptor, the synaptic GABAA receptor, with little or no activity at extrasynaptic sites. We believe we can enhance the potential utility of modulating the GABAA receptor for certain indications, and effectively avoid some of the limitations of BDZs, by developing compounds that bind to both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. The extrasynaptic GABAA receptor is structurally distinct from the synaptic receptor, possesses unique pharmacology and is located in a different place than the synaptic GABAA receptor. In addition, the extrasynaptic GABAA receptor remains intact during prolonged periods of seizure with no down-regulation while synaptic GABAA receptors are down-regulated, or diminished in their activity causing, for example, some refractory SE patients to be resistant to the action, or pharmacology, of drugs that only target the synaptic GABAA receptors, such as BDZs. Published non-clinical testing utilizing well-validated animal models of SE and sophisticated instruments for identifying the expression of both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors on the surface of neurons support this hypothesis. These studies, performed in rats, showed a reduced number and activity of synaptic GABAA receptors during SE, in contrast to the preserved number and activity of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors under the same conditions. These studies were done by measuring the amount of GABAA synaptic and GABAA extrasynaptic receptors that are present on the surface of the neurons. The analysis of protein present for each of the respective receptors in animals in the SE-state, versus normal animals, shows the difference in GABAA receptor expression.

The figure below shows the results of a rodent study where the subject animals were placed into an SE-like condition of prolonged seizure resulting in continuous spontaneous seizures. SAGE-547 was then administered to certain animals while the others received a BDZ. In this animal model, BDZs were unable to adequately control the seizure condition which we believe is due to down-regulation of synaptic GABAA receptors. In contrast, SAGE-547, working at both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, appears to have treated the seizures in these animals and resolved their SE.
 
Allosteric Modulation of NMDA Receptors to Address Certain CNS Conditions
 NMDA receptors serve a critical role in CNS-related activities. Orthosteric drug candidate approaches to modulating the NMDA receptor have also been fraught with difficulties. NMDA receptor antagonists have been explored for treating Alzheimer’s disease and neuropathic pain and for inducing anesthesia. Drugs that antagonize NMDA receptors have generally been limited by adverse effects, such as neurotoxicity, deteriorating mental status and psychotomimetic, or the onset of psychotic symptoms, following the administration of the drug. NMDA receptor agonists have been tested in schizophrenia, and many believe that they may have a role in enhancing cognition and mood. However, their ability to be used at effective doses in humans has generally been limited by non-clinical findings indicating these agents may induce cell death through excess excitation of nerve cells.
 We have identified, and continue to evaluate, a number of positive and negative allosteric modulators of the NMDA receptor that we believe have the potential to overcome the difficulties associated with orthosteric approaches. Like our GABAA allosteric modulators, our NMDA receptor allosteric modulators work at sites located in the synaptic and extrasynaptic spaces of the neuron and enhance, or modulate, the activity of the native molecule without directly activating the NMDA receptor. Initial animal testing of our NMDA receptor allosteric modulators has provided evidence that targeting the synaptic and extrasynaptic spaces may help avoid the 
 4


excitotoxicity and psychotomimesis observed with directly activating, orthosteric compounds. This in turn may eventually allow us to discover and develop, alone or with partners, compounds to treat certain conditions where NMDA receptor dysfunction may play a role in cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptoms such as certain types, aspects or subpopulations of depression, Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, Huntington’s disease, and neuropathic pain. 

Our proprietary chemistry platform
 Our proprietary chemistry platform is centered, as a starting point, on knowledge of the chemical scaffolds of endogenous neuroactive steroids that are allosteric modulators of GABAA or NMDA receptors. We have leveraged this platform to assemble a chemistry portfolio of greater than 2,000 compounds. We believe our proprietary chemistry platform allows us to:
  
• | optimize the properties of neuroactive steroid compounds to develop proprietary, new chemical entities, with the potential to be used as oral, IV, or intramuscular therapies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | control important properties such as half-life, brain penetration and the types of receptors our drugs act upon, thereby modulating either inhibition or excitation either acutely or chronically; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | create drugs that are designed to exert control over the intensity of receptor activation or deactivation, with the potential to hit targets in the brain with more precision, with the goal of increased tolerability and fewer off-target side effects than current CNS therapies.

Our Product Pipeline
 The following table summarizes the status of our development programs as of the date of this Annual Report:
 
SAGE-547
 Overview
 Our lead product candidate, SAGE-547, is in Phase 3 clinical development both as a potential adjunctive therapy in the treatment of SRSE and as a potential treatment for PPD.  SAGE-547 is a proprietary IV formulation of synthesized allopregnanolone, a naturally occurring neurosteroid that acts as a synaptic and extrasynaptic modulator of the GABAA receptor. 
 Our Phase 3 clinical trial of SAGE-547 in SRSE, known as the STATUS Trial (SAGE-547 Treatment as Adjunctive Therapy Utilized in Status Epilepticus), is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate SAGE-547 as a treatment for patients with SRSE. Enrollment in the STATUS Trial is ongoing.  We expect to announce top-line results from the STATUS Trial in the first half of 2017. If successful, we believe the results from this Phase 3 clinical trial, together with other data obtained from the SAGE-547 development program, will be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission for SAGE-547 in the U.S. in SRSE.   The FDA has granted us orphan drug designation for SAGE-547 in the treatment of SE, including SRSE, and Fast Track designation for our IND for SAGE-547 as a treatment for SRSE. Based on scientific advice we received in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the EMA, we also believe our current Phase 3 clinical program in SRSE, if successful, will be sufficient to support an MAA filing with the EMA seeking approval of SAGE-547 for SRSE in the EU.    
 The Phase 3 clinical trials of SAGE-547 in PPD, known together as the Hummingbird Study, are comprised of a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical trial of SAGE-547 in patients with severe PPD and a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate SAGE-547 efficacy and safety in patients with moderate PPD.   We anticipate announcing top-line data from the Hummingbird Study in the second half of 2017.  In the third quarter of 2016, we received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for SAGE-547 as a potential treatment for PPD. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to offer a potentially expedited development path and review for promising drug candidates, which includes increased interaction and guidance from the FDA. In December 2016, we announced input from an FDA Breakthrough Designation meeting confirming that our ongoing clinical trial in PPD, with minor modifications, including increased sample size, is considered a Phase 3 clinical trial. Based on input from the FDA, we believe that, if successful, the results of the Hummingbird Study, together with the results of prior clinical studies of SAGE-547 in PPD, and ongoing non-clinical studies, will be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA with the FDA for SAGE-547 in the treatment of PPD.    In the fourth quarter of 2016, we also received PRIME designation from the EMA for SAGE-547 in the treatment of PPD.   The PRIME program was launched by the EMA in March 2016, and the designation is designed to aid and expedite the regulatory process for investigational medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options.

SRSE
 SRSE is rare, life-threatening condition where a patient is in a state of SE and all standard treatment regimens normally sufficient in stopping seizure activity have failed. The Neurocritical Care Society defines SE as one continuous unremitting seizure lasting longer than five minutes, or recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness between seizures for greater than five minutes. Seizures are episodes of abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. Causes of SE include: low antiepileptic drug levels in patients with pre-existing epilepsy; cerebrovascular disease; metabolic and electrolyte disturbances; encephalopathies; head trauma; drug or substance intoxication; hypoxia; CNS infections; infectious diseases; genetic disorders or unknown causes.
 An SE patient is first treated with BDZs and if no response, is then treated with other, second-line, anti-seizure drugs. If the seizure persists after second-line therapy, the patient is diagnosed as having refractory SE, or RSE, admitted to the intensive care unit, or ICU, and placed into a medically induced coma.  RSE is commonly managed in the ICU by inducing either sustained seizure suppression or deeper near-complete electroencephalogram, or EEG, suppression, called “burst suppression”, using continuous IV general anesthetics.  The primary drugs used to induce coma are continuously infused IV agents such as propofol, midazolam or pentobarbital. The RSE patient is commonly monitored on a continuous basis through EEG to ensure sustained seizure suppression or burst suppression is achieved.  The goal of sustained seizure suppression or burst suppression using continuous IV general anesthetics is to allow the brain and corresponding neuronal tissue to restore function and reset to normal pre-seizure levels. After a short period, typically 24 hours, physicians attempt to wean the patient from the medically induced coma to evaluate EEG activity to assess if the neuronal activity has returned to normal levels. If unsuccessful, the patient is placed back into the medically induced coma in order to protect underlying neurological activity and brain function. At this point, patients are considered to be in a state of SRSE. The current standard of care for SRSE is empiric, and there are no therapies at present that have been specifically approved for this indication. We estimate that there are between 25,000 and 41,000 cases of SRSE each year in the U.S.

Clinical Trials of SAGE-547 in SRSE
 We are currently conducting the STATUS Trial, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial, to evaluate SAGE-547 as a treatment for patients with SRSE. We expect to enroll up to 140 patients, ages two and above, in the STATUS trial in order to obtain an estimated 126 evaluable patients. We anticipate that we will qualify approximately 180 sites in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The trial design, endpoints and statistical analysis approach for the trial are based on an agreement we reached with the FDA under a Special Protocol Assessment. Subjects are being randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SAGE-547 or placebo in addition to standard-of-care third-line anti-seizure agents for six days. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is continued resolution of SE for 24 hours following wean of all third-line agents and the blinded study drug (SAGE-547 or placebo). Patients who do not respond during the initial treatment period are eligible for open-labeled treatment with SAGE-547.

We expect to report top-line results from this trial in the first half of 2017. If successful, we believe the results from this Phase 3 clinical trial, together with other data obtained from the SAGE-547 development program, will be sufficient to form the basis of an NDA submission for SAGE-547 in SRSE in the U.S. The FDA has granted us orphan drug designation for SAGE-547 in the treatment of SE including SRSE, and Fast Track designation for our IND for SAGE-547 as a treatment for SRSE.  Based on scientific advice we received in the fourth quarter of 2016 from the EMA, we also believe our current Phase 3 program, if successful, will be sufficient to support an MAA submission to the EMA seeking approval of SAGE-547 for SRSE in the EU.
 On May 14, 2015, we reported final results from our open-label Phase 1/2 clinical trial of SAGE-547 in SRSE. In the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, 17 of 22 (77%) evaluable patients met the key efficacy endpoint of being successfully weaned off their anesthetic agents while SAGE-547 was being administered at the maintenance dose. Subsequent post-hoc analysis involving duration of the weaning period (five days versus six days) showed that 16 of 22 (73%) evaluable subjects were successfully weaned off both anesthetic agents and SAGE-547 within five days of starting the SAGE-547 infusion without the need to reinstate anesthetic agents in the following 24-hour period, while 18 of 22 (82%) evaluable subjects were weaned off both anesthetic agents and SAGE-547 within six days of starting the SAGE-547 infusion without the need to reinstate anesthetic agents in the following 24-hour period which is the key efficacy endpoint of the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial. SAGE-547 also showed favorable tolerability and a benefit-risk profile supporting further development for this acutely ill patient population. Overall, 64% of the 25 patients enrolled in the trial experienced at least one serious adverse event, though none were deemed drug-related as determined by the Safety Review Committee. Independent of treatment response, six patient deaths occurred within the study period, all driven by underlying medical conditions. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse events, EEG, physical examinations, neurological examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory measures, electrocardiograms and concomitant medication usage. In order to allow full assessment of pharmacologic activity, the trial employed broad inclusion criteria, primarily excluding patients only if there is major damage to the brain, such as anoxic injury, devastating stroke or the presence of a large lesion. Other secondary objectives used to measure efficacy included scores on global and specific scales relating to cognition, agitation and depth of coma and survival. We can provide no assurance that the positive results observed in the Phase 1/2 trial will be replicated in the ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial.
 We also expect to continue enrollment in a Phase 3 open-label expanded access trial, designated Study 302, which was initiated in April 2015. Study 302 is designed to make SAGE-547 available to patients in the U.S. who are affected by SRSE, but who have not been admitted to, nor can be transferred to, a STATUS trial site.
 PPD
 PPD is a distinct and readily identified major depressive disorder affecting an estimated 10-20% of women in the U.S. after childbirth, of whom an estimated 80% have moderate to severe symptoms.  PPD is the most common biological complication of 
 8


childbirth, and is characterized by symptoms that often include sadness and depressed mood; anxiety or agitation; loss of interest in daily activities; changes in eating and sleeping habits; feeling overwhelmed; fatigue and decreased energy; inability to concentrate; hypervigilance about the baby or lack of interest in the newborn; and feelings of worthlessness, shame or guilt, which can lead to significant functional impairment. Without sufficient treatment, PPD may inhibit the mother’s ability to perform daily activities and to bond with the baby and other members of the family. PPD also carries an increased risk for suicide in some women.  Onset of moderate or severe symptoms is typically in the third trimester of pregnancy or within 4 weeks after giving birth. Current standard of care for PPD comprises psychotherapy, and in some cases, the cautious use of pharmacological therapies such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs. Women with severe PPD may be hospitalized to provide a safe and stable environment for recovery if they have suicidal ideation or attempt, are unable to function and care for themselves, or require monitoring during a change in or trial of a new medication. There are no current approved therapies specifically for PPD.  Naturally occurring allopregnanolone is found at its highest levels in women during the third trimester of pregnancy, returning to normal levels generally within 24 hours of giving birth.  Levels of allopregnanolone have been found to be lower in women with PPD than in healthy women.  Data also suggest that women with PPD may be unusually sensitive to the rapid decline in allopregnanolone, potentially causing GABAA -system mediated mood disruption. Given these data, we believe that allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor may have potential in the treatment of PPD. 
 Clinical Trials of SAGE-547 in PPD
 The Phase 3 Hummingbird Study of SAGE-547 in PPD commenced in the third quarter of 2016 as an extension of the Phase 2 clinical study.  The Hummingbird Study is comprised of a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-ranging clinical trial of SAGE-547 in patients with severe PPD (202B) and a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate SAGE-547 efficacy and safety in patients with moderate PPD (202C).   We received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for SAGE-547 in PPD in the third quarter of 2016. Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to offer a potentially expedited development path and review for promising drug candidates, which includes increased interaction and guidance from the FDA.  In the fourth quarter of 2016, we announced input from an FDA Breakthrough Designation meeting confirming that the Hummingbird Study, with minor modifications, including increased sample size, is considered a Phase 3 clinical trial. We expect to enroll 120 patients with severe PPD in part 202B of the Hummingbird Study, with patients randomized 1:1:1 to receive either 60 mcg/kg/h or 90 mcg/kg/h of SAGE-547 or placebo (40 per group), and to enroll 100 patients with moderate PPD in part 202C of the Hummingbird Study, with patients randomized 1:1 to receive 90 mcg/kg/h of SAGE-547 or placebo (50 per group).  We anticipate announcing top-line data from the Hummingbird Study in the second half of 2017.  Based on the input we received from the FDA during the Breakthrough Designation meeting, we believe that, if successful, the results of the Hummingbird Study, together with the results of prior clinical studies of SAGE-547 in PPD, and ongoing non-clinical studies, will be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA to the FDA for SAGE-547 in the treatment of PPD.   Additional patient safety data may be acquired through an open-label program.  In the fourth quarter of 2016, we also received PRIME designation from the EMA for SAGE-547 in the treatment of PPD.   The PRIME program was launched by the EMA in March 2016, and the designation is designed to aid and expedite the regulatory process for investigational medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options. To be accepted, an investigational medicine must show the potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data.  Once an investigational candidate has been selected for PRIME, developers are assigned a dedicated contact point and a rapporteur from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, to provide continuous support and help ahead of a marketing-authorization application, as well as a meeting with a multidisciplinary group of experts to provide broader guidance on the overall development plan and regulatory strategy. Companies who receive PRIME designation for a product candidate in an indication are also eligible for accelerated assessment at the time of their regulatory application.
 In the third quarter of 2016, we announced positive top-line results from our multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-547 for the treatment of severe PPD. Twenty-one patients were enrolled in the Phase 2 clinical trial. Patients were required to have had a major depressive episode that began no earlier than the third trimester and no later than the first four weeks following delivery, and also to be less than six months postpartum at the time of enrollment. Trial participants were also required to have a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, or HAM-D, score of 26 or above prior to treatment. In the trial, SAGE-547 achieved the primary endpoint of a significant reduction in the HAM-D compared to placebo at 60 hours (p=0.008). In the trial, there was a greater than 20 point mean reduction in the depression scores of the SAGE-547 group at 60 hours through completion of the trial with a greater than 12 point difference from placebo. The statistically significant difference in treatment effect began at 24 hours (p=0.006) with an effect that was maintained at similar magnitude through to the 30-day follow-up period (p=0.01). Remission from depression, as determined by a HAM-D <7, measured at 60 hours, was seen in 7 of 10 of the SAGE-547 group compared with 1 of 11 in the placebo group. Similarly, at 30 days, 7 of 10 of the SAGE-547 group and 2 of 11 in the placebo group were in remission. SAGE-547 was found to be generally well-tolerated.  There were no deaths, serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events.

The results of the Phase 2 PPD trial replicated and extended the findings of an earlier open-label probe study of SAGE-547 in severe PPD reported in 2015 that indicated a statistically significant improvement from baseline in depression in four women within 24 hours after administration of intravenous SAGE-547. During the SAGE-547 treatment period, all four patients rapidly achieved remission, as measured by HAM-D, and improved from a mean HAM-D score of 26.5 at baseline to a mean HAM-D score of 1.8 at the end of the 60-hour treatment period. All four patients also demonstrated consistent improvement as measured by the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement, or CGI-I scale. SAGE-547 was well-tolerated in all patients treated with no serious adverse events observed on therapy or during the 30-day follow-up period, and no discontinuations due to adverse events. A total of 14 adverse events were reported in four patients. The only adverse event reported in more than one patient was sedation (sleepiness) observed in two patients, which led to a decrease in dose. 
 SAGE-217
 Overview
 SAGE-217 is a novel neuroactive steroid that is a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. Like SAGE-547, SAGE-217 targets synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. Our Phase 2 clinical program is focused on studying SAGE-217 in four indications: two movement disorder indications, essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease, and two mood disorder indications, MDD and PPD. While SAGE-547 is an IV infusion intended for acute administration, SAGE-217 is currently being studied as an oral solution. We are in the process of developing solid oral dosage forms of SAGE-217 which we plan to introduce into our Phase 2 clinical program in the first half of 2017.
 Proof-of-Concept and Phase 1 
 Given the similar mechanism of action of SAGE-217 to SAGE-547 as a modulator of the GABAA receptor, the selection of mood and movement disorders as initial indications for development of SAGE-217 was determined based, in part, on the results of completed clinical trials of SAGE-547 in PPD, as described above, and the results of a proof-of-concept clinical trial of SAGE-547 in essential tremor completed in 2015.  In the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 25 patients affected by essential tremor, where patients were exposed to the target steady state dose of SAGE-547 for only two hours, several clinician-rated and accelerometer-rated measures showed significant reductions in tremor. These changes included a statistically significant reduction in accelerometer-measured upper limb kinetic tremor (p=0.046) which is one of the major manifestations of tremor impacting morbidity. Likewise, clinician ratings of large tremor motions, as well as smaller movements such as writing and spiral drawing, also showed improvement approaching statistical significance (p=0.056). In addition, SAGE-547 demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction of tremor amplitude as measured by accelerometer (at least a 30% reduction from baseline) in 33% of patients, compared with 16% of patients in the placebo arm. In this phase of the trial, anti-tremor activity of SAGE-547 was observed at non-sedating doses, and peak anti-tremor activity correlated with steady state SAGE-547 levels. The time points showing the greatest reductions in tremor corresponded to peak plasma measurements. Seventeen of these patients were exposed to higher doses of SAGE-547 in an open-label extension with 44% demonstrating at least a 30% reduction in tremor amplitude from baseline. The most common adverse events at higher doses were fatigue and dizziness. Hypotension led to discontinuation of one patient. No serious adverse events were observed on therapy or during the 30-day follow-up period.
 In the second quarter of 2016, we announced positive top-line results of a Phase 1 clinical program of SAGE-217. In the trial, SAGE-217 was found to be generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported during the treatment and follow-up periods. Assessment of electrical activity in the brain using an EEG, showed clear evidence of target engagement (GABAA receptor modulation) starting at the lowest dose tested (15 mg). The observed EEG effect was sustained throughout the 7-day dosing period without diminution. Rates of moderate to deep sedation defined by a structured rating scale (MOAA/S < 3) were comparable to placebo until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached, in both the single and multiple ascending dose phases of the trial. The presence of sedation was associated with maximum drug exposure. As part of the Phase 1 clinical program, the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SAGE-217 were also studied in a small open-label cohort of essential tremor patients (n=6). While not designed to demonstrate efficacy, preliminary data show that single doses of SAGE-217 resulted in a similar reduction in tremor symptoms as achieved with a single 12 hour infusion of SAGE-547 in our previous placebo-controlled probe study (n=25).
 SAGE-217 Mood Disorder Programs
 Our SAGE-217 clinical program in mood disorders is comprised of Phase 2 clinical trials in MDD and PPD.
 MDD is a condition in which a patient experiences at least two weeks of a major depressive episode which causes significant distress or disability where the episode is not due to medical or substance use and there is no history of mania or hypomania.  In typical depressive episodes, the person experiences depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and reduced energy leading to diminished activity for at least two weeks. Many people with depression also suffer from anxiety symptoms and medically unexplained somatic symptoms. A person with moderate or severe MDD will typically have difficulties carrying out his or her usual work, school, domestic or social activities due to symptoms of depression.  Antidepressants are widely used in the treatment of MDD, 
 10


but many patients do not adequately respond to existing treatments.  According to estimates, approximately 16 million adults in the U.S. reported one major depressive episode in 2015.  Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest the role of GABAA receptor dysfunction in depression.  Low GABA and allopregnanolone levels have been found in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of depressed patients.  Our SAGE-217 MDD program is a two-part Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of SAGE-217 in moderate to severe MDD patients.  In February 2017, we announced top-line results from the open-label proof-of-concept portion (Part A) of the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating SAGE-217 in 13 MDD patients.  The primary endpoint of Part A was to evaluate safety and tolerability. SAGE-217 was found to be generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events or discontinuations reported.  The most common adverse events were sedation/somnolence, headache, dizziness, and myalgia.   The trial also examined the effect of SAGE-217 on the HAM-D total score, in addition to other secondary measures. Patients in the trial had a mean HAM-D total score of 27.2 at baseline.  Data demonstrated a mean reduction from baseline in the HAM-D of 19.9 points at Day 15, with 85% (11 of 13) patients showing at least a 50% reduction of their HAM-D and 62% (8 of 13) of patients achieving remission, as determined by a HAM-D ≤7.  Statistically significant mean change from baseline was observed by Day 2 of the study, following the first of once-daily, nighttime oral dosing of 30 mg of SAGE-217. A significant mean change from baseline was maintained throughout the treatment period (p<0.0001 at Day 15).  The reduction from baseline in depression ratings seen in Part A of the trial, met our criteria for advancing SAGE-217 into the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the Phase 2 clinical trial (Part B).  We expect to initiate Part B of the Phase 2 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2017.
 As discussed above, data suggest that women with PPD may be unusually sensitive to this rapid decline in allopregnanolone, potentially causing GABAA-system mediated mood disruption. Given this data, we believe that allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor may have potential in the treatment of PPD.  Our Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-217 in PPD is a Phase 2a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial that will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SAGE-217 in approximately 32 patients with severe PPD. The primary endpoint of the trial is evaluation of the effect of SAGE-217 compared to placebo following two weeks of treatment as measured by the HAM-D total score.  We expect to report top-line results from the SAGE-217 Phase 2 PPD trial in the second half of 2017.
 SAGE-217 Movement Disorder Program
 Our SAGE-217 clinical program in movement disorders is comprised of Phase 2 clinical trials in essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease.
 Essential tremor is one of the most common neurological disorders. It is a non-life threatening, chronic, progressive disorder associated with involuntary, rhythmic shaking in the upper limbs and head that can cause substantial disability. Some cases of essential tremor are inherited, and for others there is no known cause. We estimate that essential tremor affects approximately six to seven million people in the U.S., a significant portion of whom are thought to be undiagnosed and untreated. We estimate that approximately 1.5 million of those essential tremor patients have moderate to severe symptoms. Common pharmacological treatments for essential tremor include primidone; propranolol; anti-anxiety medications; and anticonvulsant drugs such as gabapentin and BDZs. Current treatments are only moderately effective, reducing, but not resolving, tremor amplitudes in approximately 50% of patients.  Non-pharmaceutical interventions in the treatment of essential tremor include the responsible use of alcohol, deep brain stimulation, focused ultrasound and thalamotomy.  Data suggest that essential tremor is associated with brain neurodegeneration, and GABAA receptor dysfunction, thus providing a rationale for studying compounds that are allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor and show anti-convulsant activity as potential treatments for essential tremor. We are currently studying the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SAGE-217 in a Phase 2a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial of approximately 80 patients with essential tremor. The primary endpoint of the trial is to compare the effect of one week of SAGE-217 on overall kinetic tremor symptoms. Secondary endpoints include additional accelerometer-derived and clinician-rated rating scales.  We expect to report top-line results from the Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-217 in essential tremor in the second half of 2017.
 Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with motor and non-motor symptoms, including resting tremor, and mood disorders.  We estimate that Parkinson’s disease affects an estimated 700,000 patients in the U.S, with an estimated 60,000 new cases each year.  Parkinson’s disease is thought to be caused by a reduction of dopamine levels as a result of loss of dopamine producing cells in the brain.  Dopamine plays a key role in smooth and coordinated muscle movements.  Current treatments for Parkinson’s disease include: levodopa/carbidopa, dopamine antagonists, MAO-B inhibitors and anticholinergics.   The part of the brain that produced dopamine also produces high levels of allopregnanolone.  Dopamine neurons are under control of the GABA system.  Decreased levels of allopregnanolone have been measured in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Parkinson’s disease. Given these data, we believe that allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor may have potential in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.   Our Parkinson's disease Phase 2 program is comprised of a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of SAGE-217 in moderate Parkinson's disease patients. Part A of the Phase 2 trial is an open-label, proof-of-concept study evaluating SAGE-217 in approximately 10 patients which, if promising, may lead to the Part B randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial. The primary endpoint for the Part A study is evaluation of the safety and tolerability of SAGE-217. The secondary endpoint is evaluation of improvement in motor symptoms as assessed by the change from baseline after one week in the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part 3 (Motor 
 11


Examination) total score.  We expect to report top-line results from the Part A open-label study of SAGE-217 in Parkinson's disease in the first half of 2017.    
 
SAGE-718
 SAGE-718 is the first product candidate selected for development from our NMDA receptor modulator program. SAGE-718 is a novel oxysterol-based positive allosteric modulator of NMDA receptors. In 2013, our scientists and collaborators published an article in The Journal of Neuroscience describing data from animal studies demonstrating that 24(S)-Hydroxycholesterol (cerebrosterol), a naturally occurring oxysterol, shows potent and selective activity in animal models as a positive allosteric modulator of NMDA receptors acting at a novel oxysterol modulatory site. SAGE-718 has been designed to be a highly potent and selective modulator of NMDA receptors with an optimized pharmacokinetic profile intended to support oral dosing. SAGE-718 has demonstrated robust activity in preclinical models of NMDA receptor hypofunction. We are developing SAGE-718 with an initial development focus on Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis and cerebrosterol (24S-HC) deficit disorders such as Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome, or SLOS.  Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis, or ANRE, is a rare autoimmune disorder in which antibodies attack NMDA receptors. Symptoms of ANRE include a highly characteristic set of neuropsychiatric deficits, including cognitive and behavioral disturbances, movement disorders and loss of consciousness. SLOS is a rare metabolic disorder caused by a mutation in the DHCR7 (7-dehydrocholesterol reductase) gene which codes for an enzyme that is involved in the production of cholesterol in the brain. SLOS is associated with significantly decreased plasma levels of cerebrosterol, suggesting that normal oxysterol-based modulation of NMDA receptors is disrupted in these patients. People affected by SLOS are unable to make enough of the necessary cholesterol in the brain to support normal growth and development, and are affected by a broad range of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental symptoms. We have completed IND-enabling non-clinical studies of SAGE-718, and plan to commence the Phase 1 clinical program in the first half of 2017.   
 Beyond SLOS and ANRE, we believe measuring levels of anti-NMDA antibodies or decreased cerebrosterol levels may represent biomarkers to identify for future study broader patient populations characterized by cognitive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric symptoms resulting from NMDA receptor dysfunction or hypofunction. Examples of these potential areas for future evaluation include certain types, aspects or subpopulations of a number of diseases such as depression, Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, Huntington’s disease, and neuropathic pain.
 SAGE-105, SAGE-324 and SAGE-689 
 SAGE-105 and SAGE-324 are novel neuroactive steroids that, like SAGE-547 and SAGE-217, target synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. In late 2016, we initiated non-clinical studies of SAGE-105 and SAGE-324 with a focus on orphan epilepsies and indications involving GABA hypofunction.  Based on data generated with SAGE-217 showing dose-related anticonvulsant activity in multiple acute seizure and chronic epilepsy models, we plan to develop SAGE-105 or SAGE-324 as an oral therapy for rare neurologic conditions associated with high frequencies of seizures, such as Tuberous Sclerosis, Dravet, Rett, PCDH-19, Dup15q and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, all of which have small patient populations and an unmet medical need for additional treatment options to treat the seizures.   
 SAGE-689 is a novel positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors shown to have anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and sedative properties in animal models. The characteristics of SAGE-689 include a wide therapeutic window to allow for modulation of the GABAA receptor without inducing deep anesthesia, and a short half-life to permit rapid onset and loss of activity. In 2015, we filed an IND for SAGE-689 with an intended focus on the treatment of SE patients whose seizures have not resolved after treatment with BDZs prior to the patient being placed in a medically-induced coma.  In response to the IND, the FDA requested additional non-clinical study data prior to commencement of a Phase 1 clinical trial.   We are in the process of assessing next steps for the SAGE-689 program, and are evaluating possible alternative formulations for SAGE-689.  
 Further Exploitation of GABAA and NMDA Receptors
 We expect to continue to focus our research and development efforts on allosteric modulation of the GABAA and NMDA receptor systems in the brain. The GABAA and NMDA receptor systems are broadly accepted as impacting many psychiatric and neurological disorders, spanning disorders of mood, seizure, cognition, anxiety, sleep, pain, epilepsy, and movement disorders among others. We believe that we will have the opportunity to develop molecules from our internal portfolio to address a number of these disorders in the future. Our ability to identify and develop such novel CNS therapies is enabled by our proprietary chemistry platform that is centered, as a starting point, on knowledge of the chemical scaffolds of certain endogenous neuroactive steroid compounds. We believe our knowledge of the chemistry and activity of allosteric modulators allows us to efficiently design molecules with different 
 12


characteristics.  This diversity enables us to regulate important properties such as half-life, brain penetration and receptor pharmacology to develop product candidates that have the potential for better selectivity, increased tolerability, and fewer off-target side effects than either current CNS therapies or previous therapies which have failed in development.
 Our current focus will remain on those indications where we can independently develop and commercialize our products, if approved. We believe our broad potential pipeline lessens our reliance on the success of any one program. We believe our ability to design and develop novel molecules with distinct profiles and receptor subtype selectivity will also provide us, in the future, with an opportunity to create value by potentially partnering these assets with third parties who possess the development and commercialization capabilities to pursue these programs.
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We neither own nor operate, and currently have no plans to own or operate, any manufacturing facilities. We currently resource all of our non-clinical and clinical material supply through third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and intend to buy all of our future commercial supplies from CMOs if our product candidates are approved.
 We have established relationships with several CMOs under which the CMOs have manufactured non-clinical and clinical supplies of SAGE-547, SAGE-217 and SAGE-718 active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, as well as drug product. All clinical supplies are manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. Starting materials and key intermediates to support the production of these candidates are manufactured by other CMOs on a purchase order basis. We do not currently have arrangements in place for either long-term supply or redundant supply of bulk drug substance or drug product for any of our product candidates. It is our intent to put long-term supply agreements in place for commercial manufacturing at the appropriate time, and to mitigate potential commercial supply risks for any products that are approved in the future through inventory management and through exploring additional manufacturers to provide API and/or drug product.
 We currently have sufficient SAGE-547 drug product on hand for our Phase 3 clinical trials in SRSE and PPD and ongoing non-clinical studies, and are working with our CMOs to prepare for validation and commercial manufacturing of SAGE-547. We currently have sufficient SAGE-217 drug substance on hand for our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials using an oral solution as the dosage form. We are in the process of developing solid oral dosage forms of SAGE-217 which we plan to introduce into our Phase 2 clinical program in the first half of 2017.
 SAGE-547, SAGE-217 and SAGE-718 are small molecules isolated as stable crystalline solids. We believe the syntheses of SAGE-547, SAGE-217 and SAGE-718 are reliable and reproducible from readily available starting materials, and the synthetic routes are amenable to large-scale manufacturing and do not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. The enantiomeric purity of SAGE-547, SAGE-217 and SAGE-718 is derived from starting materials that are obtained from natural sources. We expect to continue to identify and develop drug candidates that are amenable to cost-effective manufacturing at contract manufacturing facilities.
 Research and Development
 Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $120.8 million, $69.4 million and $24.1 million, respectively. 
 Sales and Marketing
 Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any partnership or co-promotion arrangements with an established pharmaceutical company.  We believe that we can successfully launch and commercialize SAGE-547 on our own in SRSE and PPD in the U.S. and Canada, if the product is approved for both indications, using a small and highly specialized sales force similar in size to sales forces that other companies have used to marketing products for orphan indications.  We expect to focus our future sales and marketing efforts, if SAGE-547 is approved in both indications, on critical care specialists, neurologists, epileptologists and clinical pharmacologists, in the case of SRSE, and OB/GYNs, psychiatrists, select primary care physicians, clinics, home infusion companies, and group practices, in the case of PPD, and together approximately 1,200 target hospitals particularly tertiary care centers where there are ICUs and staff trained to treat SRSE and other areas in the hospital capable of treating PPD patients with IV infusions.    
 We may decide to establish agreements or alliances with one or more distributors or pharmaceutical company collaborators to develop and commercialize our products, if approved, particularly in certain territories outside the United States where we do not 
 13


believe it makes commercial sense for us to proceed on our own.  We may also consider other partnering opportunities if we believe the partnering opportunity will add significant value to our efforts, including through capabilities, infrastructure, speed or financial contributions, particularly in areas such as depression and cognition that impact large patient populations, in each case depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the expected development pathway and related costs, deal terms, our available resources and whether the transaction makes strategic sense.
 Licenses
 We have entered into several license agreements to support our various programs.
 Washington University
 In November 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Washington University, or WU. Under this agreement, and subject to certain rights of the U.S. government and rights retained by WU, WU granted to us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain patent rights to make, have made, sell, and offer for sale, use and import products covered by certain of its patent rights. WU’s rights in patent applications disclosing and claiming SAGE-689 are included in this license agreement. Under this agreement, WU also granted us non-exclusive license under certain technical information and tangible research information to use such technical information and/or tangible research information to make, have made, sell, offer for sale, use and import products that embody or were made using a method or process covered in the technical information and/or tangible research information. The WU license also grants us a right to sublicense our licensed rights to third parties, provided each sublicensee enters into a written agreement with us with terms consistent with our agreement with WU. We must pay to WU a percentage of the revenue we receive from sublicensing our rights under this agreement, initially in the mid-teens and decreasing to the mid-single digits over time.
 Pursuant to the WU license, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue active, diligent development of licensed products and to use commercially reasonable efforts to manufacture, promote and sell licensed products throughout the territory and in the field during the term of the agreement. We must deliver written reports to WU describing our progress no later than January 31 and July 31 of the first two calendar years of the agreement, and no later than January 31 of each calendar year thereafter.
 We must pay to WU an annual maintenance fee until and including the year in which our first Phase 2 clinical trial is initiated, and we must make up to $0.7 million and $0.5 million in clinical development and regulatory milestones, respectively, to WU, for each licensed product, upon reaching certain milestones relating to the clinical development of our product candidates. The license agreement also requires us to make low single-digit royalty payments to WU in connection with the sales of licensed products.
 The WU agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the later of (i) the last day that at least one valid patent claim covering the licensed product exists, or (ii) the tenth anniversary of the day of the first commercial sale of the licensed product. We may terminate the WU agreement early for convenience upon providing WU with 90 days’ written notice. WU may terminate this agreement early in the event of our failure to cure a material breach within the applicable cure period or our bankruptcy. In the event of early termination of this agreement before the expiration of the last to expire of the patent rights, we must immediately discontinue manufacture, sale and distribution of any licensed products.
 CyDex Pharmaceuticals
 In September 2015, we amended and restated our existing commercial license agreement with CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or CyDex. Under the terms of the commercial license agreement, as amended and restated, CyDex has granted us an exclusive license to CyDex’s Captisol drug formulation technology and related intellectual property for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products incorporating SAGE-547 or SAGE-689, and the development and commercialization of the resulting products in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of any disease or symptom in humans or animals other than (i) the ocular treatment of any disease or condition with a formulation, including a hormone; (ii) topical ocular treatment of inflammatory conditions; (iii) treatment and prophylaxis of fungal infections in humans; and (iv) any ocular treatment for retinal degeneration.
 Pursuant to the CyDex license, we are required during the term of the agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue active, diligent development of the licensed product, to seek regulatory approval of the licensed product and to commercialize the licensed product following regulatory approval. We must deliver periodic progress reports to CyDex.
 We are obligated to make milestone payments under the amended and restated license agreement with CyDex based on the achievement of clinical development and regulatory milestones in the amount of $0.8 million in clinical milestones and $3.8 million in regulatory milestones for each of the first two fields with respect to SAGE-547; $1.3 million in clinical milestones and $8.5 million in regulatory milestones for each of the third and fourth fields with respect to SAGE-547; and $0.8 million in clinical milestones and 
 14


$1.8 million in regulatory milestones for one field with respect to SAGE-689. The CyDex license is perpetual until terminated. We may terminate the CyDex agreement for convenience upon providing 180 days’ prior written notice to CyDex. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement for failure to cure a material breach in the applicable cure period.
 We will also be required to pay royalties to CyDex on sales of SAGE-547 and SAGE-689, if successfully developed, in the low single digits based on levels of net sales. We are also party to a supply agreement with CyDex which was amended in September 2015 to cover the supply of CyDex’s Captisol for use in the manufacture of products incorporating SAGE-689. Under the amended supply agreement with CyDex, we are also required to purchase all of our requirements for Captisol with respect to SAGE-547 and SAGE-689 from CyDex, and CyDex is required to supply us with Captisol for such purposes, subject to certain limitations.
 University of California
 In October 2013, we entered into a license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, or the Regents, which was amended in May 2014. Pursuant to this agreement, and subject to certain rights of the U.S. government and rights retained by the Regents, the Regents granted us a non-exclusive, non-transferable license under all personal property rights of the Regents covering the tangible personal property in an IND application package owned by the Regents, or the Data, and a specified quantity of cGMP grade allopregnanolone, or the Material, to (i) use the Data for reference or incorporation in an IND for the use of the Material as a treatment of SE, essential tremor and/or severe PPD and (ii) use the Material or modifications of the Material to develop a pharmaceutical formulation for clinical trials for SE, essential tremor and/or postpartum depression. The rights licensed to us are not sublicenseable.
 Pursuant to this agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of one or more products containing allopregnanolone, a derived product under the agreement, for the treatment of SE, essential tremor and/or severe PPD. As of January 1, 2014, we must deliver written reports to the Regents describing our progress no later than 60 days subsequent to June 30 and December 31 of each fiscal year.
 This agreement requires us to make up to $0.1 million in milestone payments in connection with the first derived product that meets the relevant milestones, and we must also pay royalties of less than 1% to the Regents for each derived product for a period of 15 years following the first commercial sale of such derived product. This agreement will terminate on the earlier to occur of (i) 27 years after the effective date or (ii) 15 years after the last-derived product is first commercially sold. We may terminate this agreement early for convenience upon providing 60 days’ prior written notice to the Regents. The Regents may terminate this agreement early in the event of material default, including failure to provide timely progress reports, after the applicable cure period, or in the event of our bankruptcy. In the event of early termination of this agreement, we have the right to sell any partially made derived products for a period of 120 days from the date of termination, but would not otherwise have rights after termination under the licensed rights to make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale or import products containing allopregnanolone.
 In June 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Regents whereby we were granted an exclusive license to certain patent rights related to the use of allopregnanolone to treat various diseases. In exchange for such license, we paid an upfront payment of $50,000, and will make annual maintenance fees of $15,000 until the calendar year following the first sale, if any, of a licensed product. We are obligated to make milestone payments following the achievement of specified regulatory and sales milestones of up to $0.7 million and $2.0 million in the aggregate, respectively. Following the first sale, if any, of a licensed product, we are obligated to pay royalties at a low single digit percentage of net sales, if any, subject to specified minimum annual royalty amounts. Unless terminated by operation of law or by acts of the parties under the terms of the agreement, the license agreement will terminate when the last-to-expire patents or last-to-be abandoned patent applications expire, whichever is later.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We may also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of use, treatment and patient selection and formulations and manufacturing processes created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and 
 15


maintain our proprietary position. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the United States, permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing, or may in the future pursue, will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors.
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by our issued patents, our pending patent applications or of patent applications we may file in the future. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, or similar proceedings outside the U.S., to determine priority of invention.
 Patents
 We currently have one issued patent covering the composition of matter of SAGE-217.  We have received notices of allowances for genus and species claims covering SAGE-689 as well as for methods of use of SAGE-689.  We have a portfolio of patent applications at various stages of prosecution that fall into three categories: (1) SAGE-547-related; (2) GABAA receptor modulators; including genus and species claims to SAGE-217, SAGE-105, SAGE-324 and SAGE-689; and (3) NMDA receptor modulators, including 
SAGE-718.
 We own six patent application families generally related to SAGE-547. One of these families includes a patent application having claims to compositions containing allopregnanolone and a cyclodextrin. The compositions can be used for the treatment of CNS disorders such as SRSE, PPD and traumatic brain injury. The second patent family includes patent applications having claims directed to methods of treating seizure disorders, such as SRSE, by administering allopregnanolone using particular dosing regimens or multiple dosage phases. Any U.S. patents that may issue from these families of patent applications would have a statutory expiration date in January and August of 2033, respectively. The applications are also pending in foreign countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Indian, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, and South Africa. Two additional families of patent applications include methods of treating essential tremor and depression such as PPD. Included in these patent applications are courses of treatment and dosage regimens.  A fifth family of patent applications includes claims to deuterated neuroactive steroid compounds and compositions. A sixth family of patent applications includes claims to formulation and manufacturing of SAGE-547. Any U.S. patents that may issue from these families of patent applications would have a statutory expiration date in September 2035, April 2036, and June 2036, respectively. The time period for electing to pursue foreign patent protection for the inventions disclosed in these patent applications by filing national stage patent applications in individual jurisdictions has not yet expired, and we will need to decide whether and where to pursue ex-U.S. protection before expiration of the applicable deadlines.
 In addition to the patent applications licensed from WU, we own 23 families of patent applications, resulting from work done exclusively by us and our contract research organizations, directed to additional GABA receptor modulating compounds beyond SAGE-547 and SAGE-689, including SAGE-217 and methods of using these compounds. Any U.S. patents that may issue from these patent applications would have a statutory expiration ranging from October 2032 to November 2036. For example, our issued patent covering the composition of SAGE-217 has a statutory expiration date of April 2034. We have pending within these families of patent applications genus and species claims to the majority of the other compounds in our GABAA receptor modulating compound collection. These families of patent applications are at various stages of patent prosecution and include families for which only provisional applications have been filed. The time period for electing to pursue foreign patent protection by filing national stage patent applications in individual jurisdictions has not yet expired for some of these patent families, and we will need to decide whether and where to pursue ex-U.S. protection before expiration of the applicable deadlines.
 We have exclusively licensed a portfolio of patent applications owned by WU, which are directed to certain GABA receptor modulating compounds and methods of using these compounds, for example in anesthesia or treatment of GABA-related disorders. This portfolio includes seven families of patent applications. One of these seven families of patent applications is co-owned by us, and this co-owned family includes pending patent applications in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, and South Africa. This co-owned application discloses and claims SAGE-689 and its use in anesthesia or treatment of GABA-related disorders. Any U.S. patents that may issue from the 

 16


SAGE-689 patent family would have a statutory expiration date of December 2033. Claims generically and specifically covering SAGE-689 have been allowed.
 We also own twenty families of applications directed to modulators of NMDA receptors. Fifteen of these families of patent applications are directed to compounds that modulate NMDA receptors, including SAGE-718, which can be used to treat NMDA receptor-related disorders such as CNS-related conditions. One of these families of patent applications is directed to using a naturally occurring compound as a biomarker for a subject who would benefit from treatment with a modulator of NMDA receptors. One of these families of patent applications is directed to using a modulator of NMDA receptors to treat a rare NMDA loss of function disorder. Any patents that may issue, if any, from these families of applications directed to modulators of NMDA receptors would have statutory expiration dates in September 2032 and October 2037.
 Patent term
 The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the U.S. PTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
 The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug, and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, also have patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extension on patents covering those products, their methods of use, and/or methods of manufacture.
 Trade secrets
 In addition to patents, we may rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Companies typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of their business that are not amenable to, or that they do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets, if any, and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and partners. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all relevant inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
 Competition
 The biopharmaceuticals industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products will increase.
 Currently, there are no therapies that have been specifically approved for the treatment of SRSE. However, many products approved for other indications, including general anesthetics, ketamine and anti-seizure drugs, are used off-label for various stages of SE therapy, including in the treatment of SRSE. Additionally, though not indicated, acupuncture, hypothermia, and electroconvulsive therapy are sometimes also used prior to withdrawal of care for patients with SRSE.
 There are also no pharmacological therapies specifically approved for the treatment of PPD.  Current standard of care for PPD commonly consists of psychotherapy, however, patients with moderate or severe PPD are often prescribed anti-depressant medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs.  
 17


Current treatments for Parkinson’s disease include levodopa/carbidopa, dopamine antagonists, MAO-B inhibitors and anticholinergics.
 Common pharmacological treatments for essential tremor include primidone; propranolol; anti-anxiety medications; and anticonvulsant drugs such as gabapentin and benzodiazepines. Non-pharmaceutical interventions in the treatment of essential tremor include the responsible use of alcohol, deep brain stimulation, focused ultrasound and thalamotomy.
 MDD patients are typically treated with a variety of anti-depressant medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs.    A number of companies are developing product candidates intended for the treatment of MDD.
 In the field of neuroactive steroids focused specifically on modulation of GABAA receptors, our principal competitor is Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Marinus.  Marinus is developing a form of ganaxolone, a known GABAA positive allosteric modulator neuroactive steroid. A number of companies are working to develop products targeted at the NMDA receptor, both antagonists and agonists.
 Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors.  If we are successful in developing and gaining approval of any of our product candidates, we expect competition in the indications we are pursuing will focus on efficacy, safety, convenience, availability, and price.  Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
 U.S. drug development
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject a company to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | Completion of extensive non-clinical studies and testing, sometimes referred to as non-clinical laboratory tests, non-clinical animal studies and formulation studies, in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18


 
• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, sometimes referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an NDA, for a new drug;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the NDA filing for review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The non-clinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product.
 The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: non-clinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the non-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the non-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. Some non-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocols for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials, including whether subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or to patients with the disease or disorder being studies under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols describing, among other details, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants, and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki and/or the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial.
 19


Clinical trials
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites (typically from several hundred to several thousand subjects), and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies, or any findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Success in one phase does not mean that the results will be observed in subsequent phases. Each phase may involve multiple studies. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, we must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 NDA and FDA review process
 The results of non-clinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the United States.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through December 31, 2017, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, is approximately $2.1 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for human drugs of approximately $0.1 million and an annual establishment fee of approximately $0.6 million on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application 
 20


fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation process for an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or one or more additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, non-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 There is no assurance that the FDA will ultimately approve a drug product for marketing in the United States, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs during the review process. If a product receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA typically requires that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, and may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and efficacy and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if a REMS is required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 Orphan drug designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of 
 21


the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, benefits.
 Expedited development and review programs
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete NDA is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or offers a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval. Drugs studied for their safety and efficacy in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug, such as:
  
• | distribution restricted to certain facilities or physicians with special training or experience; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | distribution conditioned on the performance of specified medical procedures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The limitations imposed would be commensurate with the specific safety concerns presented by the drug. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more indications. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation includes the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Pediatric trials
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was signed into law on July 9, 2012, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age 
 22


groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from non-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.
 Post-marketing requirements
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the Internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or the PDMA, a part of the FDCA.
 In the United States, once a product is approved, its manufacture is subject to comprehensive and continuing regulation by the FDA. The FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Other regulatory matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services; the United States Department of Justice; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Consumer Product Safety Commission; the Federal Trade Commission; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; the Environmental Protection Agency; and state and local governments.
 In the United States, sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a company marketing a prescription drug (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward 
 23


the referral of business, including the purchase or order, or recommending the purchase or order, of a particular drug, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes created by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
 Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented claims for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. The government may deem companies to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,781 and $21,563 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
 Numerous other laws may apply to our products.  Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act.
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
 Changes in statutes, regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the 
 24


time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our then owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a full NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 European Union drug development
 In the European Union, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 The EU clinical trials legislation is currently undergoing a revision process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining the clinical trials authorization process, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials, and increasing their transparency.
 In the EU, pediatric data or an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, or waiver, is required to have been approved by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, prior to submission of a marketing authorization application to the EMA. In most EU countries, we are also required to have an approved PIP before we can begin enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial. We do not yet have an approved PIP for any of our product candidates.
 European Union drug review and approval
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, (which is comprised of 27 Member States of the EU (excludes Croatia) plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations:
 The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The 
 25


Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 European Union new chemical entity exclusivity
 In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 European Union orphan designation and exclusivity
 In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product.
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 Rest of the world regulation
 For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements applicable to a given country, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in such country if we choose to seek such approval, or we may be subject to, among 
 26


other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Reimbursement
 If we are successful in developing and gaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, sales of our products will be dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. In the United States, healthcare providers are reimbursed for covered services and products they use through Medicare, Medicaid, and other government healthcare programs as well as through commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 Third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Changes in government legislation or regulation and changes in private third-party payors’ policies toward reimbursement for our products, if successfully developed and approved, may reduce reimbursement of our products’ costs to physicians, pharmacies, and distributors. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results for any products we commercialize in the future. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product for which we received marketing approval could reduce physician usage of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 The pricing and reimbursement environment for our products may change in the future and become more challenging due to, among other reasons, policies advanced by the new presidential administration, federal agencies, new healthcare legislation passed by Congress or fiscal challenges faced by all levels of government health administration authorities. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, for example, allocated new federal funding to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same condition. The plan for the research was published in 2012 by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures are made to Congress. Although ARRA does not mandate the use of the results of comparative effectiveness studies for reimbursement purposes, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any products for which we receive marketing approval or on the reimbursement policies of public and private payors. It is possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of any product for which we receive marketing approval. For example, if third-party payors find our products not to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 One of the goals of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to herein as ACA, was to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid. The ACA also imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or ownership interest that is not timely, accurately, or completely reported (annual maximum of $150,000), and $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (annual maximum of $1 million). The reporting requirements apply only to manufacturers of products for which reimbursement is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program.  
 The new presidential administration has identified repeal and replacement of the ACA as one of its priorities.  We do not know at this time what implications such an action would have on the current requirements or on our future business.  Other health regulatory laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal civil False Claims Act, have been applied to marketing and other activities engaged in by pharmaceutical companies whose products are reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, and, in many cases, government investigations or private lawsuits under these laws have led such companies to enter settlements that include significant monetary and other penalties, We cannot predict the full impact of the laws described above on our business until we have a marketed product. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal laws discussed above. Some of these state laws apply to the 
 27


referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. There has also been a recent trend of increased state regulation of payments made to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturers’ marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 
 Other legislative changes relating to reimbursement have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services under Part A and B, including drugs and biologicals, and most payments to plans under Medicare Part D were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, or BCA, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The BCA requires sequestration for most federal programs, excluding Medicaid, Social Security, and certain other programs. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2025. As long as these cuts remain in effect, they could adversely impact payment for any products we may commercialize in the future. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability.
 In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States, and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 Employees
 As of February 15, 2017, we employed 135 full-time employees, including 94 in research and development and 41 in general and administrative and no part-time employees. 34 of our employees hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective-bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and consist of 22,067 square feet in a multi-tenant building under a lease that will expire on February 28, 2022. In May 2016, we entered into a separate lease under which, beginning on September 1, 2016, we rent 19,805 square feet of additional office space in a separate multi-tenant building.  The lease for the additional space will also expire in February 2022.
 We expect to lease additional space prior to the expiration of our leases to meet the needs of the business.
