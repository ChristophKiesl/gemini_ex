Item 1. BUSINESS
United States Steel Corporation (U. S. Steel) is an integrated steel producer of flat-rolled and tubular products with major production operations in North America and Europe. An integrated steel producer uses iron ore and coke as primary raw materials for steel production. U. S. Steel has annual raw steel production capability of 22.0 million net tons (17.0 million tons in the United States and 5.0 million tons in Europe). U. S. Steel supplies customers throughout the world primarily in the automotive, consumer, industrial and oil country tubular goods (OCTG) markets. According to worldsteel Association’s latest published statistics, U. S. Steel was the twenty-fourth largest steel producer in the world in 2015. Also in 2015, according to publicly available information, U. S. Steel was the third largest steel producer in the United States. U. S. Steel is also engaged in other business activities consisting primarily of railroad services and real estate operations. 
The Carnegie Way
In 2013, U. S. Steel launched a transformational process called the “Carnegie Way,” named after the famed American industrialist and U. S. Steel co-founder Andrew Carnegie. The Carnegie Way is a strategic, disciplined approach to transforming the Company to address the new realities of the marketplace. Through the Carnegie Way, we focus on our strengths and where we can create the most value for all U. S. Steel stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, customers and suppliers. The Carnegie Way is a framework that helps employees address all aspects of our business and achieve sustainable improvements through process efficiencies and strategic investments. We have been working through a series of transformational initiatives that we believe will enable us to more effectively add value, respond to customer needs, get leaner faster, right-size our operations and improve our performance across our core business process capabilities, including commercial, supply chain, manufacturing, procurement, innovation, and operational and functional support. Key accomplishments to date include a more intense focus on cash flow, a stronger balance sheet and a revised approach to how we view shipment volume and production. In pursuing our financial goals, we will not sacrifice our commitment to our core values of safety and environmental stewardship. We also recognize that achieving this goal requires exemplary leadership and collaboration among all employees, and we are committed to attracting, developing and retaining a workforce with the talent, skills and integrity needed for our long-term success. The Carnegie Way has already driven a shift in the Company that has enabled us to withstand the prolonged downturn in steel prices while positioning us for success in a market recovery.
Our structured approach, using the Carnegie Way value creation methodology, gives us the confidence that we can continue to make progress and create value for our customers, and when we create value for our customers, we create value for all of our stakeholders - our stockholders, our suppliers, our employees and the communities where we do business.

Segments
U. S. Steel has three reportable operating segments: Flat-Rolled Products (Flat-Rolled), U. S. Steel Europe (USSE) and Tubular Products (Tubular). The results of our railroad and real estate businesses that do not constitute reportable segments are combined and disclosed in the Other Businesses category.
Flat-Rolled
The Flat-Rolled segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel’s integrated steel plants and equity investees in the United States involved in the production of slabs, strip mill plates, sheets and tin mill products, as well as all iron ore and coke production facilities in the United States. These operations primarily serve North American customers in the service center, conversion, transportation (including automotive), construction, container, and appliance and electrical markets. 
As part of the Carnegie Way transformation, the Flat-Rolled segment was structured to better service customer needs through the creation of three "commercial entities" to specifically address customers. Our Flat-Rolled segment commercial entities include: (1) automotive, (2) consumer and (3) industrial, service center and mining. 
Automotive Solutions collaborates with customers to develop solutions such as the next generation of advanced high strength steel (AHSS) to address challenges facing the automotive industry, including increased fuel economy standards and enhanced safety requirements.
Consumer Solutions partners with customers in the appliance, packaging, container and construction markets. Consumer Solutions has a robust presence with our tin customers, who represent more than one quarter of this market category. Additional product lines within the market category include the Company's COR-TEN AZP®, ACRYLUME®, GALVALUME® and Weathered Metals Series®.
Industrial, Service Center and Mining Solutions focuses on the Company's customers in the service center business, pipe and tube manufacturing markets, and agricultural and industrial equipment markets.
Flat-Rolled has aggregate annual raw steel production capability of 17.0 million tons produced at our Gary Works, Mon Valley Works, Great Lakes Works and Granite City Works facilities. Prior to the permanent shut down of the Fairfield Flat-Rolled operations beginning in August 2015 and the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) filing and the deconsolidation of U. S. Steel Canada, Inc. (USSC) in September 2014, annual raw steel production capability for Flat-Rolled was 19.4 million tons and 22.0 million tons, respectively. Raw steel production was 10.7 million tons in 2016, 11.3 million tons in 2015 and 17.0 million tons in 2014. Raw steel production averaged 63 percent of capability in 2016, 60 percent of capability in 2015 and 80 percent of capability in 2014. In December 2015 the Granite City Works was temporarily idled and if its production capability is excluded, Flat-Rolled production would have been 75 percent of capability in 2016.
European Operations
The USSE segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel Košice (USSK), U. S. Steel’s integrated steel plant and coke production facilities in Slovakia. USSE primarily serves customers in the Eastern European construction, service center, conversion, container, transportation (including automotive), appliance and electrical, and oil, gas and petrochemical markets. USSE produces and sells slabs, sheet, strip mill plate, tin mill products and spiral welded pipe, as well as heating radiators and refractory ceramic materials.
USSE has annual raw steel production capability of 5.0 million tons. USSE’s raw steel production was 5.0 million tons in 2016, 4.7 million tons in 2015, and 4.8 million tons in 2014. USSE’s raw steel production averaged 99 percent of capability in 2016, 93 percent of capability in 2015 and 96 percent of capability in 2014.
Tubular
The Tubular segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel’s tubular production facilities, in the United States, and equity investees in the United States and Brazil. These operations produce and sell seamless and electrical resistance welded (welded) steel casing and tubing (commonly known as OCTG), standard and line pipe and mechanical tubing and primarily serve customers in the oil, gas and petrochemical markets. Tubular’s annual production capability was 2.5 million prior to the permanent shutdown of the Lorain #4 and Lone Star #1 pipe mills and the Bellville 
17

Operations, as further described below. After the permanent shutdowns, Tubular's annual production capability is 1.5 million tons.
In December of 2016, U. S. Steel made the strategic decision to permanently close the Lorain #4 and Lone Star #1 pipe mills and the Bellville Operations after considering a number of factors, including challenging market conditions for tubular products, reduced rig counts, and continued high levels of unfairly traded imports.
U. S. Steel Tubular Products, Inc. (USSTP), a wholly owned subsidiary of U. S. Steel, is designing and developing a range of premium and semi-premium connections to address the growing needs for technical solutions to our end users' well site production challenges. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, USS Oilwell Services LLC, USSTP also offers rig site services, which provides the technical expertise for proper installation of our tubular products and proprietary connections at the well site.

Business Strategy
Over the long term, our strategy is to return to our stature as an iconic industry leader, as we create a sustainable competitive advantage with a relentless focus on value creation, customer, quality, cost structure and innovation. In pursuing our strategy, we remain committed to safety and environmental stewardship. We recognize that achieving this goal requires exemplary leadership and collaboration of all employees, and we are committed to attracting, developing and retaining a high-performing workforce with the talent, skills and integrity needed for our long-term success.
We have continued to transform U. S. Steel through the two phases of focused execution of our stockholder value creation strategy: (1) earn the right to grow, and (2) drive and sustain profitable growth. Through a disciplined approach we refer to as “The Carnegie Way,” we continue working toward strengthening our balance sheet, with a strong focus on cash flow, liquidity, and financial flexibility and have launched a series of initiatives that we believe will continue to enable us to add value, re-shape the Company, and improve our performance across our core business processes, including commercial, supply chain, manufacturing, procurement, innovation, and operational and functional support.
We have worked, and continue to work, to position the Company to be best-in-class in innovation, quality and providing customer service and solutions to our customers. The strategic positioning of operations within the commercial entities enhances our ability to better hear the voice of the customer, ensuring that we deliver superior value and drive results in the markets we choose to serve. We believe this enhanced commercial concentration will continue to put U. S. Steel in a stronger position to be best-in-class in product innovation, quality and providing service and solutions to our customers, as well as steel manufacturing.

U. S. Steel continuously evaluates potential strategic and organizational opportunities, which may include the acquisition, divestiture or consolidation of assets. The Company will pursue opportunities based on the financial condition of the Company, its long-term strategy, and what the Board of Directors determines to be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders.
Changes to Operational Footprint
In December 2016, the Company reached agreements to supply iron ore pellets to third party customers over the next several years. The Keetac Iron Ore Operations restarted production in the first quarter of 2017 to take full advantage of these business opportunities. It had previously been idle since May of 2015 due to significantly lower steel production. 
In December 2016, U. S. Steel announced it would be restarting production on the hot strip mill at Granite City Works in the first quarter of 2017 to provide better alignment with customer needs and improve service while increasing the pace of our asset revitalization plan. The hot strip mill was temporarily idled in January of 2016.
In December 2016, the Company made the strategic decision to permanently close the Lorain #4 and Lone Star #1 pipe mills and the Bellville Tubular Operations after considering a number of factors, including challenging market conditions for tubular products, reduced rig counts, and unfairly traded imports.
In April 2016, U. S. Steel temporarily idled its Lone Star tubular operations. 
During 2015, the Company adjusted operating levels at several of its tubular operations as declining oil prices and rig counts have significantly reduced demand for OCTG products. 
In August 2015, U. S. Steel permanently shut down the majority of Fairfield Flat-Rolled operations.
In 2015, the Company permanently closed the coke making operations at Granite City Works and Gary Works. Also, in 2015, U. S. Steel temporarily idled steelmaking operations at Granite City Works.
On September 16, 2014, U. S. Steel Canada, Inc. (USSC), a wholly owned subsidiary of U. S. Steel, applied for relief from its creditors pursuant to Canada’s Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA). As a result of USSC filing for CCAA protection (CCAA filing), U. S. Steel determined that USSC and its subsidiaries would be deconsolidated from U. S. Steel’s financial statements on a prospective basis effective with the date of the CCAA filing.

Recent Acquisitions
On May 29, 2015, the Company purchased the 50 percent joint venture interest in Double Eagle Steel Coating Company (DESCO) that it did not previously own for $25 million. The facility coats sheet steel with free zinc or zinc alloy coatings, primarily for use in the automotive industry. DESCO’s annual production capability is approximately 720,000 tons. DESCO's electrolytic galvanizing line (EGL) has become part of the larger operational footprint of U. S. Steel's Great Lakes Works within the Flat-Rolled segment. The EGL is increasing our ability to provide industry-leading AHSS, including Gen 3 grades under development, as well as to provide high quality exposed steel for automotive body and closure applications to our customers.
Safety
U. S. Steel has a long-standing commitment to the safety and health of the men and women who work in our facilities. For our Company, safety is our primary core value. Every employee has the right to return home safely at the end of every day, and we are working to eliminate all injuries and incidents at all of our facilities. Ensuring a safe workplace also improves productivity, quality, reliability and financial performance. By making safety and health a personal responsibility, our employees are making a daily commitment to follow safe work practices, look out for the safety of co-workers and ensure safe working conditions for everyone. A “Safety First” mindset is as essential to our success as the tools and technologies we rely on to do business.
U. S. Steel finished 2016 with a Global Total OSHA Recordable Rate of 0.94, which is 73% better than the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Iron & Steel rate of 3.50 and 44% better than American Iron and Steel Institute rate of 1.67. U. S. Steel finished 2016 with a Days Away From Work Rate of 0.15, which is 85% better than the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Iron & Steel rate of 1.0 and 63% better than American Iron and Steel Institute rate of 0.40. Additionally, when comparing our most severe injuries - cases involving 31 or more days away from work - U. S. Steel performs at a level almost 6 times better than the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Iron and Steel. 
In 2016 we experienced two domestic U. S. Steel fatalities and 1 contractor fatality in Europe. These tragic events serve as a reminder that we must remain vigilant in our safety efforts to ensure every employee returns home safely every day. 
Through 2016, the 12 year performance for our key safety measures: Total Recordable and Days Away From Work rates show improvement of 40% and 57% respectively, as shown on the following graphs.

Environmental Stewardship
Throughout its history, U. S. Steel has either led the industry or used methods consistent with prevailing industry practices in its commitment to environmental stewardship. We have implemented and continue to develop business practices that are environmentally effective. We believe part of being a good corporate citizen requires a dedicated focus on how our industry affects the environment, and we have taken the actions described below in furtherance of that goal. 
U. S. Steel, largely through the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), the worldsteel Association and the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries (Eurofer), is involved in the promotion of cost effective environmental strategies through the development of appropriate air, water, waste and climate change laws and regulations at the local, state, national and international levels.
We are committed to reducing emissions as well as our carbon footprint. We have investigated, created and implemented innovative, best practice solutions throughout U. S. Steel to manage and reduce energy consumption. We are also committed to investing in technologies to further improve the environmental performance of our steelmaking process. In addition, we continue to focus on implementing energy reduction strategies, use of efficient energy sources, waste reduction management and the utilization of by-product fuels.
According to the AISI, relative to competing materials, steel has approximately one-fifth the carbon footprint of aluminum, one-twelfth the footprint of magnesium, and about one-ninth the footprint of carbon fiber composites. Our AHSS used in today’s vehicles afford significant light-weighting opportunities. When comparing steel to aluminum, in terms of sustainability, steel has a smaller carbon footprint and costs less.
U. S. Steel has historically recycled between 4 and 5 million tons of purchased and produced steel scrap every year. Because of steel’s physical properties, our products can be recycled at the end of their useful life without loss of quality, contributing to steel’s high recycling rate and affordability. Comparatively, due to limitations in aluminum processing, very little recycled aluminum is included in aluminum sheet goods used for automotive or aircraft applications. This means that any increased use of aluminum sheet for high-end applications must come from Greenhouse Gas (GHG) intensive primary aluminum, which generates significantly more GHG emissions than steel.
All of our major production facilities have Environmental Management Systems that are certified to the ISO 14001 Standard. This standard, published by the International Organization for Standardization, provides the framework for the measurement and improvement of environmental impacts of the certified facility.
Commercial Strategy
Our commercial strategy is focused on providing customer focused solutions with value-added steel products, including AHSS and coated sheets for the automotive and appliance industries, electrical steel sheets for the manufacture of motors and electrical equipment, galvanized and Galvalume® sheets for construction, tin mill products for the packaging industry and a vast array of steel products, including OCTG and premium connections, for use in the drilling, storage, and transmission of North American shale oil and gas. 
We are committed to anticipating our customers' changing needs by developing new steel products and uses for steel that meet the evolving market and regulatory demands imposed on them. In connection with this commitment, we have research centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Košice, Slovakia, an automotive center in Troy, Michigan and an Innovation and Technology Center for Tubular products in Houston, Texas. The focus of these centers is to develop new products and work with our customers to better serve their needs. Examples of our customer focused product innovation include the development of the first commercially available coated AHSS and GEN3 steels and embedding application engineers at original equipment manufacturers to demonstrate how to best utilize the material in body design to meet automobile passenger safety requirements while significantly reducing weight to meet future vehicle fuel efficiency standards; and a line of premium and semi-premium tubular connections to meet our customers’ increasingly complex needs for offshore and horizontal drilling. Designed and developed at the Innovation and Technology Center in Houston, USS- Liberty TC™ is the first domestically made, threaded and coupled premium connection with a metal-to-metal seal that has been tested to the 2014 version of API 5C5 CAL IV. USS- Liberty TC™ was successfully installed by a subsidiary of Range Resources Corporation and is available to other energy producers. This work in premium connection development is supported by our investment in a new full scale tubular connection test frame located at Offshore Operations in Houston, Texas. Please refer to Item I. Business Strategy for further details of our commercial entities and related strategies.

Capital Projects and Other Investments
We are currently developing projects within our Flat-Rolled, USSE and Tubular segments to revitalize our assets, enhance quality and reliability, expand production of AHSS, deliver additional premium connections, and improve our capabilities in packaging. This will further enhance our ability to support our customers’ evolving needs and increase our value-added product capabilities. We have substantially completed the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to replace our existing information technology systems, which will enable us to operate more efficiently. The completion of the ERP system is expected to provide further opportunities to streamline, standardize and centralize business processes in order to maximize cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations.
Workforce
At U. S. Steel, we are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining a workforce of talented, high integrity, diverse people — all working together to deliver superior results for our Company, stockholders, customers and communities. We regularly review our human capital needs and focus on the selection, development and retention of employees in order to sustain and enhance our competitive position in the markets we serve.
Capital Structure and Liquidity
Our primary financial goal is to enhance stockholder value by focusing on our capital structure, liquidity, and financial flexibility by deploying cash strategically as we earn the right to grow. Our cash deployment strategy includes maintaining a healthy pension plan; delivering operational excellence with a focus on safety, quality and reliability; and the revitalization of our capital, both human and equipment, to enable sustainable growth.
In 2016, we undertook several steps to support these goals. The Company issued $980 million of 8.375% Senior Secured Notes due July 1, 2021 and received net proceeds of approximately $958 million, which was used to repay certain of the Company's outstanding debt obligations. Additionally, the Company completed an optional redemption of its outstanding 6.05% Senior Notes due 2017 for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $444 million plus a total make whole premium of approximately $22 million. Further, the Company repurchased approximately $6 million of its 6.05% Senior Notes due 2017, approximately $339 million of its 7.00% Senior Notes dues 2018, approximately $168 million of its 7.375% Senior Notes due 2020 and approximately $75 million of its 6.875% Senior Notes due 2021 through various tender offers and open market purchases.
During August 2016, we made a voluntary contribution of 3,763,643 shares of the Company’s common stock to U. S. Steel's main defined benefit pension plan as part of our long term pension liability management strategy. The shares were valued at a price of $26.57 per share, or approximately $100 million in the aggregate, which was the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the contribution. Also during August 2016, U. S. Steel issued 21,735,000 of common shares in an underwritten public offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $482 million, which will be used for financial flexibility, revitalization of assets and general corporate purposes.
During 2016, U. S. Steel repaid $1.0 billion of debt. We ended 2016 with $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand and total liquidity of approximately $2.9 billion.
Steel Industry Background and Competition
The global steel industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity.
U. S. Steel's competitive position may be affected by, among other things, differences among U. S. Steel's and its competitors' cost structure, labor costs, environmental remediation and compliance costs, global capacity and the existence and magnitude of government subsidies.
U. S. Steel competes with many North American and international steel producers. Competitors include integrated producers, which, like U. S. Steel, use iron ore and coke as the primary raw materials for steel production, as well as electric arc furnace (EAF) producers, which primarily use steel scrap and other iron-bearing feedstocks as raw materials. Global steel capacity has continued to increase, with some published sources estimating that steel capacity in China alone is over one billion metric tons per year. In addition, other products, such as aluminum, plastics and composites, compete with steel in several applications.
25

EAF producers typically require lower capital expenditures for construction of facilities and may have lower total employment costs; however, these competitive advantages may be minimized or eliminated by the cost of scrap when scrap prices are high, which was not the case in 2015 and 2016. Some mini-mills utilize thin slab casting technology to produce flat-rolled products and are increasingly able to compete directly with integrated producers in many flat-rolled product applications previously produced only by integrated steelmakers.
U. S. Steel provides defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefits to approximately 100,000 current employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Many of our competitors do not have comparable retiree obligations. Participation in U. S. Steel's main defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants on July 1, 2003 and benefit accruals for all non-represented participants were frozen effective December 31, 2015. The 2015 Labor Agreements provided for the closure of other post-retirement benefits (OPEB) plans to represented employees hired or rehired under certain conditions on or after January 1, 2016.
U. S. Steel believes that our major North American and many European integrated steel competitors are confronted with substantially similar environmental regulatory conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors will be materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations. However, if future regulations do not recognize the fact that the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create CO2 emissions without linking these emissions to steel scrap as well, our competitive position relative to mini-mills will be adversely impacted. Our competitive position compared to producers in developing nations such as China, Russia, Ukraine and India, will be harmed unless such nations require commensurate reductions in CO2 emissions. Competing materials such as plastics may not be similarly impacted. The specific impact on each competitor will vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods. U. S. Steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to former and present operating locations and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Many of our competitors, including North American producers, or their successors, that have been the subject of bankruptcy relief have no or substantially lower liabilities for such environmental remediation matters.
International Trade
U. S. Steel faces competition from non-U.S. steel producers, many of which are heavily subsidized by their governments and dump steel into the U.S. market. Trade-distorting policies and practices, coupled with global steel overcapacity, impact pricing in the U.S. market and influence the Company's ability to compete on a level playing field. Several 
flat-rolled products were granted trade relief through a series of three trade cases which concluded during 2016.
U. S. Steel continues to lead the industry in efforts to address illegal dumping and subsidized imports that injure the economic health of our country, our Company and our workers.
On June 3, 2015, U. S. Steel filed antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) cases against China, India, Italy, South Korea, and Taiwan for the import of unfairly traded corrosion-resistant steel (CORE). On June 2, 2016, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) issued its affirmative CVD determinations against China, India, Italy, and South Korea, and affirmative AD determinations against China, India, Italy, South Korea, and Taiwan. On June 24, 2016, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) determined that the U.S. industry is materially injured by reason of imports of CORE from all five countries. Following the USITC's affirmative determinations, the DOC published its AD and CVD orders on July 25, 2016. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is now enforcing these decisions and collecting AD and CVD duties. 
Shortly before the DOC published the final AD/CVD orders on CORE from China, imports of CORE from Vietnam surged dramatically. Suspecting that Chinese producers were diverting cold-rolled steel to Vietnam to undergo minor processing before exporting to the United States in an attempt to avoid paying the new duties, U. S. Steel and the other domestic producers filed a request on June 3, 2016, asking the DOC to conduct an anti-circumvention investigation. DOC initiated its investigation on November 14, 2016, and in December 2016 identified and sent questionnaires to Vietnamese producers, requesting confidential quantity and value information. The DOC received responses from Vietnamese producers on December 28, 2016. If the DOC determines that imports of CORE from China are being channeled through Vietnam, it will impose duties on Vietnamese imports of CORE. The entire proceeding should be completed within 300 days of the initiation date, unless the deadline is extended by the DOC.
On July 28, 2015, U. S. Steel filed AD and CVD petitions charging that unfairly-traded imports of cold-rolled steel products from Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, Russia, and the United Kingdom are causing material injury to the domestic industry and that the foreign producers in Brazil, China, India, South Korea, and Russia 
26

benefit from numerous countervailable subsidies. On May 24, 2016, the DOC published its final determinations in the AD investigations against China and Japan and the CVD investigation against China. On June 22, 2016, the USITC announced its affirmative determinations against China and Japan on the basis of cumulated subject imports from all seven countries. The DOC published its AD and CVD order against China and Japan on July 14, 2016. For the remaining countries - Brazil, India, South Korea, Russia, and the United Kingdom - the DOC issued its final AD and CVD determinations on July 29, 2016, which was followed by a final affirmative injury determination by the USITC against Brazil, India, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. The DOC published its final AD and CVD orders on September 20, 2016. CBP is now enforcing these decisions and collecting AD duties on cold-rolled steel imports from Brazil, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, and CVD duties on imports from Brazil, China, India, and South Korea.
Following the publication of the AD/CVD orders, imports of cold-rolled steel from Vietnam significantly increased. Suspecting that Chinese producers were diverting cold-rolled steel to Vietnam to undergo minor processing before exporting to the United States in an attempt to avoid paying the new duties, U. S. Steel and several other domestic producers filed a request on September 27, 2016, for DOC to conduct an anti-circumvention investigation. The DOC initiated its investigation on November 14, 2016, and in December 2016 identified and sent questionnaires to Vietnamese producers, requesting confidential quantity and value information. The DOC received responses from Vietnamese producers on December 28, 2016. If the DOC determines that imports of cold-rolled steel from China are being redirected through Vietnam en route to the United States, it will impose duties on imports of cold-rolled steel from Vietnam. The entire proceeding should be completed within 300 days of the initiation date, unless the deadline is extended by the DOC.
On August 11, 2015, U. S. Steel filed AD and CVD petitions for the imposition of duties on hot-rolled coil from Australia, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. On August 12, 2016, the DOC published affirmative final determinations in the CVD investigations against Brazil, South Korea, and Turkey and the AD investigations against Australia, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. On September 12, 2016, the USITC announced its determination that the industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports of hot-rolled steel products from Australia, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as subject imports from Turkey, that were sold in the United States at less than fair value. The DOC published AD and CVD orders on October 3, 2016.
At present, U. S. Steel is also involved in several appeals filed with the Court of International Trade from the OCTG cases. In addition to defending on-going appeals, U. S. Steel continues to be actively engaged in relevant administrative reviews and five-year ("sunset") reviews before the USITC and the DOC.
In April 2016, U. S. Steel launched a case under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against ten of the eleven largest Chinese producers and their distributors. The complaint alleges three causes of action: 1) illegal conspiracy to fix prices and control output and export volumes; 2) the theft of trade secrets through industrial espionage; 3) circumvention of duties by false labeling and transshipment. On May 26, 2016, the USITC instituted an investigation on all three causes. The remedy sought in the petition is the barring of Chinese steel and alloy products from the U.S. market. Of the original forty named respondents, twenty Chinese producers and distributors failed to appear and defaults have been entered against them, including the ninth largest steel company in China (which is also the eighteenth largest in the world). 
On November 14, 2016, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) initially granted Chinese respondent’s motion to dismiss U. S. Steel’s antitrust claim. On November 23, 2016, U. S. Steel petitioned for review of the ALJ’s determination granting the Respondent’s motion to terminate the antitrust claim. On December 19, 2016, the USITC announced it will review the ALJ’s determination and invited interested parties to file written submissions. The USITC is expected to issue a determination in the first quarter of 2017. Upon review of all written submissions, the USITC will also determine whether to conduct oral arguments, which, if granted, will be held on March 14, 2017. 
On January 12, 2017, the ALJ granted the Respondent’s motion to dismiss U. S. Steel’s trans-shipment claim. On January 23, 2017, U. S. Steel filed a petition for review of that determination. The USITC is expected to decide whether to review the dismissal of this claim in the first quarter of 2017.
On February 15, 2017, U. S. Steel filed a motion to withdraw its trade secrets claim without prejudice and to stay all matters on this claim until the ALJ can rule on the motion. The motion is unopposed. The trade secrets claim was the only one of three claims that avoided dismissal by the ALJ. While Section 337 offers U.S. companies the ability to seek relief against unfair methods of competition and the items being unfairly imported as a result of those actions, the 
27

decade's old law never contemplated the technological advancements over the past 50 years that have led to the proliferation of cyber theft and other cyber crimes committed against American companies. As such, the burdens imposed by the law are impracticable for corporate victims of cybercrime. U. S. Steel continues to advocate for legal reforms to address these issues and will revisit its trade secrets claim when the legal environment for such claims improves.
In the European Union (EU), USSK is participating in and cooperating with the European Commission's (EC) dumping action concerning hot-rolled steel flat products from China, which was initiated in February 2016. On October 6, 2016, the EC imposed provisional duties on hot-rolled steel flat products imported from China of between 13.2 and 22.6 percent. These duties are intended to offset the harm caused to the domestic steel industry by below-cost Chinese imports. The EC is expected to impose definitive duties in April 2017.
The EC initiated a concurrent subsidies investigation regarding hot-rolled steel flat products from China on May 13, 2016. The EC is expected to impose provisional duties to countervail unfair subsidies in February 2017.
On July 7, 2016, the EC opened an investigation against Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, Iran and Brazil to determine whether exporters of hot-rolled flat products from the subject countries sold in the EU below cost, and to assess whether the subject imports caused injury to the industry. If the case is successful, duties could be levied against hot-rolled steel products from the subject countries. The EC is expected to impose provisional duties in April 2017.
On February 13, 2016, the EC initiated an investigation to determine whether imports of heavy steel plate from China are being sold in the EU below cost, and to assess whether such imports are harming the domestic industry. On October 6, 2016, the EC imposed provisional dumping duties of between 65.1 and 73.7 percent on imports of heavy steel plate from China. The EC is expected to impose definitive duties in April 2017.
Also on February 13, 2016, the EC initiated a dumping investigation regarding seamless pipe and tube of non-stainless steel imported from China. On November 12, 2016, the EC imposed provisional dumping duties between 43.5 and 81.1 percent. The EC is expected to impose definitive duties in May 2017.
On December 9, 2016, the EC initiated an investigation to determine whether imported CORE from China is being sold in the EU below cost and to assess whether such imports are harming the domestic industry. The EC is expected to impose provisional duties in September 2017.
USSK actively participated in an investigation concerning cold-rolled steel flat products from China and Russia. On July 29, 2016, the EC imposed definitive dumping duties of between 19.7 and 22.1 percent against Chinese imports and between 18.7 and 36.1 percent against Russian imports of cold-rolled steel flat products.
On December 12, 2016, China filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States and the European Union. The complaint alleges that the U.S. and EU are violating their treaty obligations by continuing to use the non-market economy (NME) methodology for price comparisons in antidumping duty investigations. China’s Accession Protocol, the agreement that China entered into in order to become a WTO Member, contemplated that China would have made the transition from NME to market economy by December 11, 2016. However, the U.S. and EU continue to find that China exercises too much control over its economy and have committed to continuing to use the NME methodology in AD investigations. U. S. Steel is actively monitoring this dispute as the outcome will impact all U.S. and EU dumping orders on Chinese goods, including many steel products. 
U. S. Steel continually assesses the impact of imports from foreign countries on our business, and continues to execute a broad, global strategy to enhance the means and manner in which it competes in the U.S. market and internationally. In an effort to mitigate the negative impact of unfairly traded foreign imports on our business, U. S. Steel has commenced substantive work with regional trade partners and organizations, and outlined a robust engagement with the Administration to tackle global overcapacity. Across diverse platforms, U. S. Steel is leveraging its unique experience, knowledge, and reputation to forge alliances and partnerships to advance innovative structural changes to commercial and legal regimes to better position and support the U.S. steel industry in the 21st century and beyond.

Other Businesses
U. S. Steel’s Other Businesses include railroad services and real estate operations.
U. S. Steel owns the Gary Railway Company in Indiana, Lake Terminal Railroad Company and Lorain Northern Company in Ohio, Union Railroad Company, LLC in Pennsylvania, Fairfield Southern Company, Inc. located in Alabama, Delray Connecting Railroad Company in Michigan and Texas & Northern Railroad Company in Texas, these entities comprise U. S. Steel’s transportation business. 
U. S. Steel owns, develops and manages various real estate assets, which include approximately 50,000 acres of surface rights primarily in Alabama, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. In addition, U. S. Steel holds ownership interests in joint ventures that are developing real estate projects in Alabama. 
Raw Materials and Energy
As an integrated producer, U. S. Steel’s primary raw materials are iron units in the form of iron ore pellets and sinter ore, carbon units in the form of coal and coke (which is produced from coking coal) and steel scrap. U. S. Steel’s raw materials supply strategy consists of acquiring and expanding captive sources of certain primary raw materials and entering into flexible supply contracts for certain other raw materials at competitive market prices which are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions at the time.
The amounts of such raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products, the quality of raw materials and, to a lesser extent, differences among steel producing equipment. In broad terms, U. S. Steel consumes approximately 1.4 tons of coal to produce one ton of coke and then it consumes approximately 0.3 tons of coke, 0.3 tons of steel scrap (40 percent of which is internally generated) and 1.3 tons of iron ore pellets to produce one ton of raw steel. At normal operating levels, we also consume approximately 6 mmbtu’s of natural gas per ton produced. While we believe that these estimated consumption amounts are useful for planning purposes, and are presented to give a general sense of raw material and energy consumption related to steel production, substantial variations may occur.
Iron Ore
Iron Ore Production(a)
(a) Includes our share of production from Hibbing and Tilden. The decrease in iron ore production from 2014 is primarily related to the idling of our Keetac facility. In the first quarter of 2017 the Keetac facility restarted production.
The iron ore facilities at Minntac and Keetac contain an estimated 880 million short tons of recoverable reserves and our share of recoverable reserves at the Hibbing and Tilden joint ventures is 33 million short tons. Recoverable reserves are defined as the tons of product that can be used internally or delivered to a customer after considering mining and 
33

beneficiation or preparation losses. Minntac and Keetac’s annual capability and our share of annual capability for the Hibbing and Tilden joint ventures total approximately 25 million tons. Through our wholly owned operations and our share of joint ventures, we have iron ore pellet production capability that exceeds our steelmaking capability in the U.S. 
We sold iron ore pellets in 2016, 2015 and 2014 to third parties. The Company has reached agreements to supply iron ore pellets to third-party customers over the next several years. 
Substantially all of USSE’s iron ore requirements are purchased from outside sources, primarily Russian and Ukrainian mining companies. However, in 2014 and prior years, USSE also received iron ore from U. S. Steel’s iron ore facilities in North America. We believe that supplies of iron ore adequate to meet USSE’s needs are available at competitive market prices.
Coking Coal
All of U. S. Steel’s coal requirements for our cokemaking facilities are purchased from outside sources. U. S. Steel has entered into multi-year contracts for a portion of Flat-Rolled’s coking coal requirements. Prices for these North American contracts for 2017 are set at what we believe are competitive market prices. Prices in subsequent years will be negotiated in accordance with contractual provisions on an annual basis at prevailing market prices or have fixed prices for a set time frame.
Prices for European contracts are negotiated at defined intervals, usually quarterly.
We believe that supplies of coking coal adequate to meet our needs are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. The main source of coking coal for Flat-Rolled is the United States, and sources for USSE include Poland, the Czech Republic, the United States, Russia, and Ukraine.
Coke
Coke Production(a)
(a) The decrease in 2016 coke production from 2015 was due to decreased internal steel production and depletion of existing coke inventory. The decrease in 2015 coke production from 2014 is due to the permanent shutdown of coke operations at Gary Works and Granite City Works. The decrease in 2014 coke production from 2013 is primarily due to the deconsolidation of USSC and the permanent shut down of two coke batteries at Gary Works.
In North America, the Flat-Rolled segment operates a cokemaking facility at the Clairton Plant of Mon Valley Works. At our Granite City Works, we also have a 15-year coke supply agreement with Gateway which began in 2009. In Europe, the USSE segment operates cokemaking facilities at USSK. Blast furnace injection of coal, natural gas and self-generated coke oven gas is also used to reduce coke usage. 
With Flat-Rolled’s cokemaking facilities and the Gateway long-term supply agreement, it has the capability to be self-sufficient with respect to its annual coke requirements at normal operating levels. Coke is purchased from, sold to, or swapped with suppliers and other end-users to adjust for production needs and reduce transportation costs.
34

To mitigate exposure to changes in coke costs and supply disruptions, U. S. Steel entered into multi-year arrangements with several of our coal suppliers to supply our domestic cokemaking facilities.
USSE is self-sufficient for coke at normal operating levels.
Steel Scrap and Other Materials
We believe supplies of steel scrap and other alloy and coating materials required to fulfill the requirements for 
Flat-Rolled and USSE are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. Generally, approximately 40 percent of our steel scrap requirements are internally generated through normal operations.
Limestone
All of Flat-Rolled’s and USSE's limestone requirements are purchased from outside sources. We believe that supplies of limestone adequate to meet our needs are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices.
Zinc and Tin
We believe that supplies of zinc and tin required to fulfill the requirements for Flat-Rolled and USSE are available from outside sources at competitive market prices.
Natural Gas
All of U. S. Steel’s natural gas requirements are purchased from outside sources.
We believe that adequate supplies to meet Flat-Rolled’s and Tubular's needs are available at competitive market prices. During 2016, we routinely executed fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts for natural gas to partially manage our exposure to natural gas price increases. For 2016, approximately 68 percent of our natural gas purchases in Flat-Rolled were based on bids solicited on a monthly basis from various vendors; the remainder were made daily or with term agreements or with fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts. 
We believe that adequate natural gas supplies to meet USSE’s needs are available at competitive market prices. During 2016, we routinely executed fixed-price forward physical purchase contract for natural gas to partially manage our exposure to natural gas price increases. For 2016, approximately 50 percent of our natural gas purchases in USSK was made with fixed-price forward physical purchase contract; the remainder were based on bids solicited on a quarterly, monthly or a daily basis from various vendors.
Both Flat-Rolled and USSE use self-generated coke oven and blast furnace gas to reduce consumption of natural gas. USSE also captures and consumes converter gas from its four steelmaking vessels.
Industrial Gases
U. S. Steel in North America, purchases industrial gas under long-term contracts with various suppliers. USSE owns and operates its own industrial gas facilities, but also may purchase industrial gases from time to time.
Commercial Sales of Product 
U. S. Steel characterizes sales as contract sales if sold pursuant to an agreement with a defined volume and pricing and a duration of longer than three months, and as spot if sold without a defined volume and pricing agreement. In 2016, approximately 78 percent, 64 percent and 40 percent of sales by Flat-Rolled, USSE and Tubular, respectively, were contract sales. Some contract pricing agreements include fixed prices while others are adjusted periodically based upon published prices of steel products or cost components. 
Environmental Matters 
Some of U. S. Steel’s facilities were in operation before 1900. Although management believes that U. S. Steel’s environmental practices have either led the industry or at least been consistent with prevailing industry practices, hazardous materials may have been released at current or former operating sites or delivered to sites operated by third parties.

Our U.S. facilities are subject to environmental laws applicable in the U.S., including the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as state and local laws and regulations.
U. S. Steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating, and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations, related to release of hazardous materials, which in recent years have been mainly for process changes to meet CAA obligations and similar obligations in Europe. 
Air
The CAA imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program and civil and criminal enforcement sanctions. The CAA requires, among other things, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Standards. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed various industry-specific MACT standards pursuant to this requirement. The CAA requires the EPA to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category of Hazardous Air Pollutants. The EPA also must conduct risk assessments on each source category that is already subject to MACT standards and determine if additional standards are needed to reduce residual risks.
While our operations are subject to several different categories of NESHAP and MACT standards, the principal impact of these standards on U. S. Steel operations includes those that are specific to cokemaking, ironmaking, steelmaking and iron ore processing.
The EPA is currently in the process of completing a Residual Risk and Technology Review of the Integrated Iron and Steel regulations and Coke MACT regulations as required by the CAA. Because the EPA has not completed its review, any impacts related to the EPA’s review of these standards cannot be estimated at this time, 
The CAA also requires the EPA to develop and implement National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria pollutants, which include, among others, particulate matter (PM) - consisting of PM10 and PM2.5, lead, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. Sulfur dioxide is the NAAQS criteria pollutant of most concern to the Company at this time.
In June 2010, the EPA significantly lowered the primary NAAQS for sulfur dioxide (SO2) from 140 parts per billion (ppb) on a 24-hour basis to an hourly standard of 75 ppb. Subsequently, the EPA designated the areas in which Great Lakes Works and Mon Valley Works facilities are located as nonattainment with the 2010 for the SO2 NAAQS. The non-attainment designation will require the facilities to implement operational and/or capital requirements to demonstrate attainment with the 2010 standard. In addition, the EPA is currently evaluating the attainment status for all other areas as required by a Consent Decree that the EPA entered with the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Counsel in March 2015 pursuant to a lawsuit filed by the non-governmental organizations. U. S. Steel is working with the relevant regulatory agencies in completing the evaluation process as required by the Consent Decree. While U. S. Steel could face increased capital, operating and compliance costs, the operational and financial impact of the SO2 NAAQS cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
In October 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. It is likely that EPA will designate some areas in which we operate as nonattainment with the 2015 standard, which could require reductions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds from our operations in such designated areas. In April 2012, the EPA designated certain areas in which we operate as nonattainment with the 2008 ozone NAAQS of 75 pbb. The EPA is expected to publish an ozone implementation rule that will address the effect of the 2008 standard and area designations in light of the lowering of the NAAQS in 2015. At this time, the operational and financial impact of the ozone NAAQSs cannot be reasonably estimated.
On December 14, 2012, the EPA lowered the annual standard for PM2.5 from 15 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) to 12 ug/m3, and retained the PM2.5 24-hour and PM10 NAAQS rules. In December 2014, the EPA designated some areas in which U. S. Steel operates as nonattainment with the 2012 annual PM2.5 standard. Because it is early in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) development stages, any impacts to U. S. Steel are not estimable at this time.
In 2010, the EPA retained the annual nitrogen dioxide NAAQS standard, but created a new 1-hour NAAQS and established new data reduction and monitoring requirements. While the EPA has classified all areas as being in attainment or unclassifiable, it is requiring implementation of a network of monitoring stations to assess air quality. 
36

Until the network is implemented and further designations are made, the impact on operations at U. S. Steel facilities cannot be estimated at this time.
For additional information regarding significant enforcement actions, capital expenditures and costs of compliance, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Environmental Proceedings."
Water
U. S. Steel maintains water discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program of the CWA, and under equivalent state laws, and conducts operations in compliance with such permits. For information regarding enforcement actions, capital expenditures and costs of compliance, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Environmental Proceedings."
Solid Waste
U. S. Steel facilities generate solid and hazardous wastes regulated by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In addition, each state and some local jurisdictions regulate solid and hazardous waste activities. In addition to regulating waste handling and disposal practices, these laws and regulations also govern the environmental remediation of some prior waste disposal operations (i.e., corrective actions), the recycling of wastes and the operation and maintenance of waste storage tanks. Corrective actions under these laws, are discussed below under “Remediation.” For additional information regarding significant remediation costs, enforcement actions, capital expenditures and costs of compliance, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Environmental Proceedings.”
Remediation
U. S. Steel is involved in a number of environmental remediation projects under CERCLA, RCRA and other federal and state statutes, related to former and present locations as well as third party waste sites where material generated by U. S. Steel was deposited. A number of these locations either never were, or are no longer, owned or operated by U. S. Steel and are subject to cost sharing and remediation provisions. Projects include remediation of the former Geneva Works, the former Duluth Works, ground water issues at Gary Works and the closure of hazardous and non-hazardous waste landfills. It is possible that additional sites will be identified that require remediation. For additional information regarding remedial actions, capital expenditures and costs of compliance, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Environmental Proceedings.”
United States GHG Regulation
The current and potential regulation of GHG emissions remains a significant issue for the steel industry, particularly for integrated steel producers such as U. S. Steel, but also increasingly for EAF producers due to regulatory actions impacting the power generation sector. The EPA has classified GHGs, such as CO2, as harmful gases. Under this premise, it has implemented a GHG emission monitoring and reporting requirement for all facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons or more per year of CO2, as well as equivalent CO2 quantities of methane and nitrous oxide.
On August 3, 2015, the EPA issued three separate actions to address GHG emissions from fossil fuel fired power plants: 1) final rules for new, modified or reconstructed sources, 2) final rules for existing sources, and 3) a proposed Federal Implementation Plan. The rules for new, modified, or reconstructed sources impose separate intensity-based GHG limits for new coal fired and new natural gas fired power plants. The rules for existing fossil fuel fired power plants impose a two-part goal structure for existing power generation in each state. The structure is composed of an interim goal for states to meet on average over the ten-year period from 2020-2029, and a final goal that a state must meet at the end of that period in 2030 and thereafter. The final goal is to achieve a 32 percent reduction of GHG emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels. States will be given flexibility in terms of how to achieve their goal and what measures to implement, but must have submitted plans no later than September 6, 2016. The proposed Federal Implementation Plan would apply to any state that does not submit an EPA approved plan. In February 2016, the United States Supreme Court stayed the effectiveness of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) until judicial review of the rule is completed. Oral arguments were heard by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on September 27, 2016. The impact these rules will have on the supply and cost of electricity to industrial consumers, especially energy intensive industries like ours, is being evaluated. We believe there will be increased operating costs, such as increased energy and maintenance costs, but we are currently unable to reliably estimate them.

U. S. Steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating, and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations, related to release of hazardous materials, which in recent years have been mainly for process changes to meet CAA obligations and similar obligations in Europe. Future compliance with CO2 emission requirements may include substantial costs for emission allowances, restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal, natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems. Because we cannot predict what requirements ultimately will be imposed in the U.S. and Europe, it is difficult to estimate the likely impact on U. S. Steel, but it could be substantial. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of U. S. Steel's products and services, operating results will be reduced.

Slovak Operations
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed in March of 2013 between U. S. Steel and the government of Slovakia. The MOU outlines areas in which the government and U. S. Steel will work together to help create a more competitive environment and conditions for USSK. Incentives the government of Slovakia agreed to provide include potential participation in a renewable energy program that provides the opportunity to reduce electricity costs, as well as the potential for government grants and other support concerning investments in environmental control technology. Although there are many conditions and uncertainties regarding the grants, including matters controlled by the EU, the value of these incentives as stated in the MOU could be as much as €75 million (approximately $79 million). U. S. Steel also agreed to pay the government of Slovakia specified declining amounts should U. S. Steel sell USSK within five years of the date of the MOU. We continue to work closely with the government of Slovakia to monitor the progress of the respective commitments and to achieve the incentives described in the MOU.
Slovakia adopted a new waste code in March 2015 that became effective January 1, 2016. This legislation implements the EU Waste Framework Directive that strictly regulates waste disposal and encourages recycling, among other provisions, by increasing fees for waste disposed of in landfills, including privately owned landfills. The impact of this legislation is estimated to be €2 million (approximately $2 million) annually.
The EU’s Industry Emission Directive requires implementation of EU determined best available techniques (BAT) to reduce environmental impacts as well as compliance with BAT associated emission levels. This directive includes operational requirements for air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid waste disposal and energy conservation, dictates certain operating practices and imposes stricter emission limits. Producers were required to be in compliance with the iron and steel BAT by March 8, 2016, unless specific exceptions or extensions were granted by the Slovak environmental authority. USSK updated existing operating permits for different facilities involved in producing iron and steel in the plant in accordance with the new BAT requirements. Through this process for some facilities, USSK has obtained extensions from the 2016 compliance deadline in order to meet or exceed the BAT requirements. Compliance with stricter emission limits going beyond BAT requirements makes us eligible for EU funding support and prepares us for any further tightening of environmental protection standards. Our most recent broad estimate of likely capital expenditures for projects to comply with or go beyond the BAT requirements is €138 million (approximately $145 million) over the 2017 to 2020 time period. 
The EU has various programs under which funds are allocated to member states to implement broad public policies which are then awarded by the member states to public and private entities on a competitive basis. The funding intensity under these programs currently ranges from 55 percent of defined eligible costs on a project under the standard state scheme to 90 percent on a recently approved ad hoc scheme to improve the air quality in the Košice region of Slovakia. Based on our list of projects that comprise the approximate €138 million (approximately $145 million) of spending noted, we currently believe we will be eligible to receive up to €85 million (approximately $90 million) of incentive grants. This could potentially reduce our net cash expenditures to approximately €53 million (approximately $56 million). The actual amount of capital spending will be dependent upon, among other things, the actual amount of incentive grants received.
We also believe there will be increased operating costs associated with these projects, such as increased energy and maintenance costs. We are currently unable to reliably estimate what the increase in operating costs will be as many projects are still in the development stage.

European Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations
The European Commission (EC) has created an Emissions Trading System (ETS) and starting in 2013, the ETS began to employ centralized allocation, rather than national allocation plans, that are more stringent than the previous requirements. The ETS also includes a cap designed to achieve an overall reduction of GHGs for the ETS sectors of 21% in 2020 compared to 2005 emissions and auctioning as the basic principle for allocating emissions allowances, with some transitional free allocation provided on the basis of benchmarks for manufacturing industries under risk of transferring their production to other countries with lesser constraints on GHG emissions, commonly referred to as carbon leakage. Manufacturing of sinter, coke oven products, basic iron and steel, ferro-alloys and cast iron tubes have all been recognized as exposing companies to a significant risk of carbon leakage, but the ETS is still expected to lead to additional costs for steel companies in Europe. The EU has imposed limitations under the ETS for the period 2013-2020 (Phase III) that are more stringent than those in the 2008 - 2012 period (NAP II), reducing the number of free allowances granted to companies to cover their CO2 emissions.
The EU has established GHG regulations for the EU member states. International negotiations to supplement and eventually replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol are ongoing. In December 2015, Paris held the Conference of Parties (COP21) summit on global warming. The summit proposed goals and protocols for global CO2 reduction. On October 5, 2016 the threshold for entry into force of the Paris Agreement was achieved. The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016. In October 2014, the European Council approved 2030 goals in the areas of GHG reduction, energy efficiency and the use of renewable resources. Those targets are expected to transfer into legislation by 2020. Revision of the legislation is in the advanced stage, with two important EU Parliament Committees already giving their opinion. Final voting in the European Parliament is expected in the summer of 2017. Until the full details of the program are made known through specific enacting legislation, we cannot reasonably forecast the costs and benefits which might result from the program.
In the future, compliance with EU CO2 emission requirements for USSK may include substantial costs for emission allowances, restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal, natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems.

Legal Proceedings - Environmental Proceedings" and Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Contingencies and Commitments - Environmental Matters - European Union (EU) Environmental Requirements."

Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, U. S. Steel had approximately 18,000 employees in North America and approximately 11,800 in Europe.
Most hourly employees of U. S. Steel’s flat-rolled, tubular, cokemaking and iron ore pellet facilities in the United States are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the United Steelworkers (USW) that are effective as of September 1, 2015 and expire on September 1, 2018. Our North American collective bargaining agreements contain no-strike provisions which are applicable during the term of the respective agreements. 
In Europe, most employees at USSK are represented by the OZ KOVO union and are covered by an agreement that expires at the end of March 2020.
39

A small number of workers at some of our North American facilities and at our transportation operations are covered by agreements with the USW or other unions that have varying expiration dates.
