In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise dictates, “AdvanSix”, the “Company”, “we” or “our” means AdvanSix Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Separation from Honeywell
 
On October 1, 2016, Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”) completed the previously announced separation of AdvanSix Inc. The separation was completed by Honeywell distributing (the “Distribution”) all of the then outstanding shares of common stock of AdvanSix on October 1, 2016 (the “Distribution Date”) through a dividend in kind of AdvanSix common stock, par value $0.01, to holders of Honeywell common stock as of the close of business on the record date of September 16, 2016 who held their shares through the Distribution Date (the “Spin-Off”). Each Honeywell stockholder who held their shares through the Distribution Date received one share of AdvanSix common stock for every 25 shares of Honeywell common stock held at the close of business on the record date of September 16, 2016. We filed our Form 10 describing the Spin-Off with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which was declared effective by the SEC on September 8, 2016 (the “Form 10”). On October 3, 2016, AdvanSix stock began “regular-way” trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the “ASIX” stock symbol. The Spin-Off is further described in Note 1 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Description of Business
 
AdvanSix Inc. is an integrated manufacturer of Nylon 6, a polymer resin which is a synthetic material used by our customers to produce engineered plastics, fibers, filaments and films that, in turn, are used in such end-products as automotive and electronic components, carpets, sports apparel, fishing nets and food and industrial packaging. As a result of our backward integration and the configuration of our manufacturing facilities, we also sell a variety of other products, all of which are produced as part of the Nylon 6 resin manufacturing process including caprolactam, ammonium sulfate fertilizers, and other chemical intermediates as follows:

• | Caprolactam – Caprolactam is the key chemical compound used in the production of Nylon 6 resin. In recent years, approximately 60% of the caprolactam we have produced at our facility in Hopewell, Virginia has been shipped to our facility in Chesterfield, Virginia to manufacture Nylon 6 resin. We market and sell the caprolactam that is not consumed internally in Nylon 6 resin production to customers who manufacture polymer resins or use caprolactam to produce nylon fibers, films and other nylon products. Our Hopewell manufacturing facility is one of the world’s largest single-site producers of caprolactam as of December 31, 2016.

Our manufacturing process is fully backward integrated. We use cumene, a chemical compound produced from benzene and propylene, to manufacture phenol, acetone and AMS, at our Frankford, Pennsylvania plant. The majority of the phenol we manufacture is further processed at our Hopewell facility through an integrated series of unit operations which also consume natural gas and sulfur, to produce caprolactam and ammonium sulfate. Our caprolactam is then shipped to our Chesterfield plant, where it is polymerized into Nylon 6 resin.
 

Our integrated manufacturing process, scale and the quantity and range of our products make us one of the most efficient manufacturers in our industry. We consistently focus on and invest in improving production yields from our various manufacturing processes to build on our leading cost position. Our global logistics infrastructure supports our commercial mission by ensuring a reliable intraplant supply chain and consistent and timely delivery to our customers while maximizing our distribution resources and our operating efficiency. In addition, we strive to understand the product applications and end-markets into which our products are sold, which helps us upgrade the quality, chemical properties or packaging of our products in ways to attract price premiums and greater demand.
 
All of our manufacturing plants and operations are located in the United States. We serve approximately 500 customers globally located in more than 40 countries. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had sales of $1,191.5 million, $1,329.4 million and $1,790.4 million with net income of $34.1 million, $63.8 million and $83.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our international sales were $216.4 million, $372.1 million and $510.7 million, respectively.

Competitive Strengths
 
Our competitive strengths include the following:
 
Large-Scale Single-Site Producer of Caprolactam and Ammonium Sulfate. We operate one of the world’s largest single-site caprolactam and ammonium sulfate production facilities, which is a competitive advantage in our highly-fragmented industry. Our scale provides operating leverage and the opportunity to achieve stronger business performance than our competitors in several ways. Most fundamentally, our large scale enables us to spread fixed and overhead costs across more pounds of production, thereby enabling us to produce caprolactam at a lower per pound price than our competitors. In addition, the scale of our operations benefits our procurement activities for raw materials and services. Large scale also helps drive our sales. We believe that our reputation as one of the world’s largest producers of caprolactam, Nylon 6 resin, ammonium sulfate and associated chemical intermediates, encourages potential customers to approach us for stability of their supply requirements.
Low Cost Position Driven by Favorable Geographical Location, Integrated Manufacturing Footprint and High Utilization Rates. Our access to lower cost raw materials, backward integrated manufacturing facilities and high plant utilization rates help us maintain our position as the world’s lowest cost producer of caprolactam. First, the location of our manufacturing operations in the United States affords us access to the world’s lowest cost natural gas, which is a key raw material needed to manufacture the ammonia used in the production of caprolactam as well as the source of power for our manufacturing operations. By contrast, a significant number of our competitors are located in geographic locations where energy prices are substantially higher. Second, we are fully backward integrated into several key feedstock materials necessary to produce caprolactam and Nylon 6 resin, particularly phenol, ammonia and oleum/sulfuric acid, which we believe is a unique advantage in our industry. Backward integration contributes to higher operating margins by lowering raw material transportation, handling and storage costs. It also enables us to remain flexible, while optimizing sales from our diverse portfolio of products. Finally, our long-term customer relationships and contracts enable us to maintain high plant utilization rates, which, along with our large scale, provide significant operating and purchasing leverage.
Global Reach. The global reach of our sales and marketing capabilities enables us to compete everywhere nylon resin, caprolactam and ammonium sulfate are consumed. Our sales, marketing, technical and procurement staff reside in eight countries, and in 2016 approximately 18% of our sales were outside the United States. Our freight and logistics capabilities and terminal locations position us well to serve global markets, including the dock and loading facility at our Hopewell facility which is capable of serving ocean-going freight vessels. Our global reach enables us to arbitrage geographic price variations to ensure we are receiving the highest value for our products.

Technical Know-how, Customer Intimacy and Application Development Capabilities. Intimate knowledge of our customers and end-market applications, combined with our technical know-how, enables us to develop specialty products that are often valued higher by customers compared to commodity products. We have an R&D department consisting of nearly 50 scientists and engineers with advanced degrees in polymer synthesis, catalysis and chemical and polymer engineering, who work not only on developing new products for nylon resins but also drive exacting offerings for our chemical intermediates and ammonium sulfate customers. In June 2015, we expanded our capabilities to test and scale production of copolymer Nylon 6/6.6 resin, which is used in food packaging films and other applications. We have also invested in an R&D facility located in Shanghai, China that specializes in working with caprolactam and nylon resin customers to develop products for specialty applications. Further, our agronomists provide the latest scientific information on the importance of sulfur nutrition and how to optimize the benefits of ammonium sulfate fertilizer to our global customers through a variety of channels including webinars, an “Ask the Agronomist” blog, technical training sessions for retailers and direct grower meetings.
Diverse Revenue Sources from the Sale of Fertilizer, Acetone and Other Chemical Intermediates. Due to our specific chemical manufacturing processes, backward integration and scale, we produce ammonium sulfate fertilizer, acetone and a wide range of other chemical intermediates that enable us to diversify our revenue sources. Most significantly, for every pound of caprolactam produced, we produce approximately four pounds of ammonium sulfate, a fertilizer used by farmers around the world. For the past two decades we have employed agronomists to educate growers and retailers in the Americas on the yield value of using ammonium sulfate fertilizer on key crops including corn, coffee, sugar and cotton. Sales of ammonium sulfate in 2016 were $283.4 million and represented 24% of our total sales. Sales of acetone also help us diversify our revenue sources. We are among the most significant suppliers of acetone to a variety of end-markets in North America. Sales of acetone in 2016 were approximately $169 million and represented 14% of our total sales. In addition to fertilizer and acetone, other products from our manufacturing process include merchant phenol, AMS, cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol, sulfuric acid, ammonia, MEKO and carbon dioxide. The diversity of our sales portfolio helps to mitigate, to some extent, the cyclicality in our end-markets.
Business Strategies 
 
Our business strategies include the following:
 
Build on our Low Cost Leadership Position. Through our size, access to low cost raw materials, backward integration and high utilization rates, we intend to continue expanding operating margins by continuing to lower our Nylon 6 resin, caprolactam and ammonium sulfate production costs. Our focus on operational excellence and continuing productivity improvements will be concentrated on the following:

• | Selective investments to increase production volume through asset reliability, flexibility and capacity. For example, by investing in intermediate chemical buffer storage capacity, we can continue to produce Nylon 6 resin, caprolactam and ammonium sulfate even when the targeted production units are offline for routine maintenance or when there is an unplanned interruption in production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Energy and direct material yield reduction initiatives aimed at increasing plant productivity and lowering costs; and 
• | Further deployment of improved procurement processes, competitive bidding and supplier diversification to reduce raw material costs. 

 
Leverage our R&D Investments and Applications Expertise. Our customers typically buy caprolactam and nylon resin for compounding or extruding with additives and other materials, to increase strength or flexibility or to add color to make the resin more suitable for use in their end products such as textiles, packaging and industrial materials. We intend to leverage our R&D investments, customer intimacy and product applications know-how to develop new formulations of resin products to better serve our customers and increase the value of our resin products portfolio. For example, engineered plastics that utilize Nylon 6 and Nylon 6.6 resin are being increasingly used in automobiles to reduce weight as automobile manufacturers strive to meet stricter fuel efficiency standards. We intend to work with our customers serving this market to develop resin products specifically tailored for these product applications. Likewise, we are working to develop and sell nylon resin products with differentiated characteristics for wire and cable applications and flexible food packaging. Another focus of our R&D initiatives will be nylon resin processing technologies that can produce existing types of high value resins at lower costs. Working with existing and potential customers while understanding end-use applications, our R&D team will continue to build application development capabilities to better understand and protect the value proposition of our new products.
 
Selective Investments to Produce Higher Value Products. Historically, a significant portion of the Nylon 6 resin we produced was sold as a commodity product and, as a result, was subject to cyclicality. Over the past several years, we have invested in capabilities to increase the value of our product portfolio. For example, we recently announced the installation of a new production line at our Chesterfield facility that is capable of producing multiple grades of higher value Nylon 6 resin as well as copolymer Nylon 6/6.6 resin, both of which are used in engineered plastics for the automotive industry, films for food packaging, as well as other higher value applications. Similarly, we will explore other investments that will enable us to produce higher value products that meet the exacting specifications of customers in certain high value industries.

Pursue a Highly-Selective Acquisition Strategy. We expect to seek strategic acquisitions and alliances to supplement our organic sales by broadening our customer base, expanding our geographic reach and developing our technology and product portfolios. For example, we intend to evaluate the potential acquisition of, on a select basis, businesses that would enable us to produce higher value resin products, including copolymers, or would improve our access to certain geographic regions.
 
Use of Toll Manufacturers to Produce Higher Margin AdvanSix-Developed Specialty Products. We are adept at using our technical know-how and customer intimacy to develop products that blend our nylon resin with other types of nylon and non-nylon resin products and additives to produce higher value products. Where we do not have the in-house manufacturing capabilities to produce these products, we contract with third-party compounders to toll manufacture for us. By utilizing third-party toll manufacturing arrangements to either divert nylon resin away from more commoditized end-markets or expand the geographic end-markets available to us, we intend to increase sales and expand our operating margins.
Industry Overview 
 
Nylon and Caprolactam. According to PCI Wood Mackenzie, the global demand for Nylon 6 resin as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 5,200 kMT, spanning a variety of end-uses such as engineered automotive plastics, carpets, textiles, industrial filament and food and industrial films. The market growth typically tracks global growth but varies by end-use. Some of these end-markets, such as engineered automotive plastics, are experiencing increased demand due to trends in light weighting to meet stricter fuel efficiency standards. We expect this trend of increasing demand to continue as our customers find new uses for Nylon 6 resin, both within existing and new end-markets.
 
Generally, prices for Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam reflect supply and demand in the marketplace as well as the value of the basic raw materials used in the production of caprolactam, consisting primarily of benzene, and, depending on the manufacturing process utilized, natural gas and sulfur. The price of benzene is a key driver of caprolactam prices because it is the common chemical compound used in the petrochemical derivatives, such as phenol and cyclohexane, which are the key feedstock materials for caprolactam depending on a given plant’s manufacturing technology. As a result, the global prices for caprolactam typically track as a spread over the price of benzene. Generally, Nylon 6 resin prices track the cyclicality of caprolactam prices, although, to the extent Nylon 6 resin producers are able to manufacture specialized nylon resin products, prices set above the spread are achievable.
 
The global market for Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam has undergone significant change in the past five years as Chinese manufacturers have entered the market and increased global supply at a time when demand has remained relatively stable. As a result of the increased capacity and competitive intensity, the margins for Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam have declined in recent years to historic lows in 2016.
 
Ammonium Sulfate and Other Chemical Intermediates. Our ammonium sulfate fertilizer products are primarily sold in North and South America. Ammonium sulfate is used as a nitrogen fertilizer on key crops that benefit from sulfur micronutrients and, as of December 31, 2016, accounts for approximately 4% of the global market for nitrogen fertilizer. Urea is one global price driver for all nitrogen fertilizers, including ammonium sulfate, and urea pricing has been under pressure recently due to the loosening of Chinese government export policies and the growth of both Chinese and broader global production capacity. A second global price driver for ammonium sulfate fertilizer is the price of future deliveries of crops, including corn, wheat and coffee, which are impacted by general trends in the agricultural industry.
 
Our chemical intermediates are used as key inputs for a variety of end-market products including construction materials, paints and coatings, packaging and consumer applications. The prices for our chemical intermediates generally correlate to the prices of their underlying raw materials.
 
Competition 
 
Competition across all of our product offerings is based on a variety of factors such as price, reliability of supply, product innovation and quality. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, R&D efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product classes. The global market for Nylon 6 resin, caprolactam and ammonium sulfate is highly fragmented, and we compete with integrated manufacturers, such as BASF Corporation, Sinopec Limited, DOMO Chemicals GmbH, LANXESS AG and Ube Industries, Ltd. We also compete with manufacturers that only produce polymer resins, such as Li Peng Enterprise Co. Ltd. and Zig Sheng Industrial Co., Ltd. We also compete with synthetic manufacturers of ammonium sulfate, agricultural fertilizers, such as Pasadena Commodities International, and phenol producers, such as Ineos Phenol. A number of our products are sold in a market with many competitors, some of which have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. Additionally, our competitors include companies that have global operations as well as those operating only within specific geographic regions.

We produce and sell our chemical intermediates to a range of customers for use in many different types of end-products. In 2016, our chemical intermediates products generated $368.7 million of sales, of which $281.7 million, or 76%, came from sales of phenol, acetone and AMS, and $86.9 million, or 24%, came from sales of our other chemical intermediates. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, chemical intermediate sales were 31%, 30% and 34% of our total sales, respectively.
 
Phenol is a key chemical intermediate of caprolactam, and we produce all of the phenol we use in our caprolactam manufacturing process at our Frankford plant. Approximately 75% to 80% of the phenol we produce is forward integrated into our production of caprolactam and other chemical intermediates at Hopewell, and approximately 20% to 25% of our production is sold to customers for use in their product applications. Our customers use phenol to produce a variety of end-products such as resins, epoxies and bisphenolA.
 
All of our acetone is sold to customers for use in end-products such as adhesives, paints, coatings, solvents, herbicides and other engineered plastic resins. Acetone is typically used by our customers as a key raw material in the production of a variety of other chemicals, used in the applications above
 
We also produce and sell AMS, MEKO, cyclohexanone, cyclohexanol, acetaldehyde oxime and 2-pentanone oxime. We use some of these products in our manufacturing process and also sell them to customers for use in end-products such as resins, inks, paints, coatings and agricultural chemical intermediates and detergents.
 
Raw Materials 
 
The primary raw material used in our manufacturing process is cumene, which is produced from benzene and propylene by our suppliers. We purchase cumene from a number of suppliers to ensure stability of supply and optimal terms for this key raw material. Other important raw materials we use in our manufacturing process are sulfur and natural gas, which we use to produce ammonium sulfate and caprolactam. We purchase sulfur and natural gas from a diverse set of suppliers. 

9
-


 Historically, we have been able to renew contracts with our suppliers and obtain sufficient quantities of cumene, sulfur, natural gas or any of our other key raw materials. Global supply and demand can significantly impact the price of our key raw materials and historically prices have been cyclical. We continually seek to reduce costs of key raw materials and do not foresee any material constraints in the near term resulting from pricing or availability.
 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
We have a global sales force with long-standing relationships with our customers and deep expertise with our products, product applications and end-markets. We predominantly sell directly to our customers, primarily under contracts but also through spot transactions under purchase orders.
 
All of our products are supported by our global logistics capability that we employ to ensure reliable and timely delivery to our customers while maximizing distribution resources and efficiency.
 
Customers 
 
Globally, we serve approximately 500 customers in a wide variety of industries. In 2016, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 40% of our total sales. Our largest customer is Shaw Industries Group, Inc., one of the world’s largest consumers of caprolactam and Nylon 6 resin. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, our sales to Shaw were 17%, 16% and 19%, respectively, of our total sales. We sell Nylon 6 resin and caprolactam to Shaw under a long-term contract. We typically sell to our other customers under short-term contracts, with one- to two-year terms, or by purchase orders. We have historically experienced low customer turnover.
Seasonality 
 
Except for our ammonium sulfate fertilizer products, which are influenced by seasonal growing patterns in North and South America, sales of most of our products have been subject to minimal or no seasonality. Due to the fertilizer sales cycle, we occasionally build up higher inventory balances because the production volumes are generally steady month to month rather than tied to seasonal demand for fertilizers.
Backlog
 
In general, the Company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Therefore, the Company believes that backlog information is not material to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial return. However, we do have many long-term supply contracts which carry minimum order obligations.
Research & Development and Intellectual Property 
 
We believe success in our industry is driven by technological strength and innovation. Our R&D activities focus equally on improving our chemical manufacturing processes to increase efficiency, capacity and productivity and lower costs and innovating for new product applications.
 
We benefit from numerous patents and trademarks that we own. We sell our Nylon 6 resin under the Aegis® brand name, our nylon films under the Capran® brand name and our ammonium sulfate fertilizer under the Sulf-N® brand name. Chemical intermediates are also sold under the brand names of Nadone®, Naxol® and EZ-Blox™. We also benefit from technology covered by trade secrets, including know-how and other proprietary information relating to many of our products, processes and technologies. We do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We intend to continue taking steps as necessary to protect our intellectual property, including, when appropriate, filing patent applications for inventions that are deemed important to our business.
 
We conduct R&D at technology centers with approximately 50 researchers in total. We lease space at Honeywell’s technology centers in the United States in Colonial Heights, Virginia and in Shanghai, China. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our R&D expenses were approximately $13.8 million, $12.8 million and $13.0 million, respectively.
