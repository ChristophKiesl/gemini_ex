ITEM 1 – Business General Development of Business Founded in 1870 by George H. Tennant, Tennant Company ("the Company, we, us, or our"), a Minnesota corporation incorporated in 1909, began as a one-man woodworking business, evolved into a successful wood flooring and wood products company, and eventually into a manufacturer of floor cleaning equipment. Throughout its history, the Company has remained focused on advancing our industry by aggressively pursuing new technologies and creating a culture that celebrates innovation. Today, the Company is a recognized leader of the cleaning industry. We are passionate about developing innovative and sustainable solutions that help our customers clean spaces more effectively, addressing various cleaning challenges. The Company operates in three geographic business units including the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific (APAC). The Company is committed to empowering our customers to create a cleaner, safer and healthier world with high-performance solutions that minimize waste, reduce costs, improve safety and further sustainability goals. Principal Products, Markets and Distribution The Company offers products and solutions consisting of mechanized cleaning equipment, detergent-free and other sustainable cleaning technologies, aftermarket parts and consumables, equipment maintenance and repair service, and business solutions such as financing, rental and leasing programs, and machine-to-machine asset management solutions. The Company's products are used in many types of environments including: retail establishments, distribution centers, factories and warehouses, public venues such as arenas and stadiums, office buildings, schools and universities, hospitals and clinics, parking lots and streets, and more. The Company markets its offerings under the following brands: Tennant®, Nobles®, Alfa Uma Empresa Tennant™, IRIS®, VLX™, IPC brands, Gaomei and Rongen brands as well as private-label brands. The Company's customers include contract cleaners to whom organizations outsource facilities maintenance, as well as businesses that perform facilities maintenance themselves. The Company reaches these customers through the industry's largest direct sales and service organization and through a strong and well-supported network of authorized distributors worldwide. | Raw Materials The Company has not experienced any significant or unusual problems in the availability of raw materials or other product components, other than those mentioned in Item 1A - Risk Factors. The Company has sole-source vendors for certain components. A disruption in supply from such vendors may disrupt the Company’s operations. However, the Company believes that it can find alternate sources in the event there is a disruption in supply from such vendors. Intellectual Property Although the Company considers that its patents, proprietary technologies and trade secrets, customer relationships, licenses, trademarks, trade names and brand names in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, it does not regard its business as being materially dependent upon any single item or category of intellectual property. We take appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property to the extent such intellectual property can be protected. Seasonality Although the Company’s business is not seasonal in the traditional sense, the percentage of revenues in each quarter typically ranges from 22% to 28% of the total year. The first quarter tends to be at the low end of the range reflecting customers’ initial slow ramp up of capital purchases and the Company’s efforts to close out orders at the end of each year. The second and fourth quarters tend to be toward the high end of the range and the third quarter is typically in the middle of the range. Major Customers The Company sells its products to a wide variety of customers, none of which are of material importance in relation to the business as a whole. The customer base includes several governmental entities which generally have terms similar to other customers.

Competition Public industry data concerning global market share is limited; however, through an assessment of validated third-party sources and sponsored third-party market studies, the Company is confident in its position as a world-leading manufacturer of floor maintenance and cleaning equipment. Several global competitors compete with the Company in virtually every geography of the world. However, small regional competitors are also significant competitors who vary by country, vertical market, product category or channel. The Company competes primarily on the basis of offering a broad line of high-quality, innovative products supported by an extensive sales and service network in major markets. Human Capital Tennant Company has a commitment to our employees to foster a culture of integrity and stewardship. This guides our actions as we manage our business and holds us accountable to our colleagues to care for one another and work together for our mutual safety. To that end, our executive leadership, as well as our Board of Directors, emphasize the importance of positive human capital management. The following are key human capital measures and objectives that the Company currently focuses on: Employee Safety - We prioritize the health and safety of all of our employees. In our manufacturing facilities, we have established safety teams that proactively identify areas of improvement and help to reinforce employee behaviors in order to reduce or eliminate incidents. In our manufacturing facilities, behavioral safety culture is a primary focus, with a specific growing emphasis on “near-miss” reporting and resolution. We define a near-miss event as a situation where no property was damaged, and no personal injury was sustained, but given a slight shift in time or position, damage and/or injury could have occurred. This focus has increased awareness to potential incidents at our facilities. The result is a continuing positive trend in safety issues in our facilities. Additionally, we have an experienced team of Enterprise Health and Safety professionals that provide onsite and corporate level support to our global teams. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - Tennant is proud to be an equal opportunity employer where we foster and maintain an ethical work environment free of discrimination. Employment decisions are made on the basis of individual skill, ability, reliability, productivity, and other factors important to performance. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, national origin, physical or mental disability, age, veteran status, pregnancy, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity, or any other basis protected by state or federal law or local ordinance. | Diversity in Governance - As of December 31, 2020, women represented 29% of our executive management team and 33% of our Board of Directors. Gender Equitable Pay - In 2020, Tennant Company performed a gender wage gap analysis to evaluate any gender differences in pay. The median income for women working full time in the United States was reported to be 99.36% as compared to their male counterparts. In other words, women at Tennant were seen to be making 99.36 cents to every $1 men earned. To put this figure in context, Tennant’s wage gap findings were compared to the national average. According to the national statistics published by Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in 2019, women on average made 81.6% of the earnings made by males. The adjusted pay gap at Tennant was found to be 99.89% after controlling for variables such as title, grade, and work location, that are legitimate and non-discretionary reasons for pay difference. Also, this leftover gap of 0.11% was statistically not significant, suggesting that there is no evidence of pay gap at Tennant Company.

ITEM 1A – Risk Factors The following are material factors known to us that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Macroeconomic Risks We may encounter financial difficulties if the United States or other global economies experience an additional or continued long-term economic downturn, decreasing the demand for our products and negatively affecting our sales growth. Our product sales are sensitive to declines in capital spending by our customers. Decreased demand for our products could result in decreased revenues, profitability and cash flows and may impair our ability to maintain our operations and fund our obligations to others. In the event of a continued long-term economic downturn in the U.S. or other global economies, our revenues could decline to the point that we may have to take cost-saving measures, such as restructuring actions. In addition, other fixed costs would have to be reduced to a level that is in line with a lower level of sales. A long-term economic downturn that puts downward pressure on sales could also negatively affect investor perception relative to our publicly stated growth targets. Uncertainty surrounding the impacts and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The coronavirus ("COVID-19") outbreak that originated in China and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization at the beginning of 2020 continues to cause volatility and economic disruption across the globe. The impact of COVID-19, or any variant thereof, on our business and financial performance depends on evolving factors that we cannot accurately predict, including the duration of the pandemic, restrictions on travel and transportation, the effect on our customers and on the global supply chain, the demand for our products, government actions that have or could result in further closures of or restrictions on our manufacturing plants, and the pace of economic recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. During 2020, certain of our manufacturing plants suspended operations temporarily either due to government restrictions or employee health concerns. There may be a risk of future health concerns and we cannot predict future disruptions of our plants or the duration of such future disruptions. Our customers have been negatively impacted which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our sales. In addition, our suppliers may not have the ability to provide us with parts needed to manufacture our products. This may result in delays in shipments to us and also to our customers, which would affect our results of operations. If the COVID-19 or other health pandemic continues for an extended period of time, we will need to assess our liquidity needs. A sustained disruption in the global economy could materially affect our ability to generate sufficient cash from operations and could require us to seek additional sources of liquidity or take further actions. It could also impact our strategic objectives.

Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk. Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial, tax and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade, tax compliance, data-privacy, labor and safety and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws from other countries. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S., but because we are a U.S.-based company, oftentimes they are also subject to U.S. laws which can create a conflict. Despite our due diligence, there is a risk that we do not have adequate resources or comprehensive processes to stay current on changes in laws or regulations applicable to us worldwide and maintain compliance with those changes. Increased compliance requirements may lead to increased costs and erosion of desired profit margin. As a result, it is possible that the activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Business Ethics Guide. Violations of the U.S. or local laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. Industry Risks We may be unable to take advantage of product pricing due to the competitive marketplace and increased price sensitivity. Simplification of our customer product pricing is a key initiative to reduce the complexity in which we operate. The current competitive landscape, coupled with macroeconomic factors, could impact our ability to achieve our pricing targets. These pressures, along with internal constraints, may limit our ability to sell our products at our expected prices and may result in a change to the mix of product offerings or where we have a competitive advantage. Increasing our prices in this competitive market, where customers are very price sensitive, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We are subject to competitive risks associated with developing innovative products and technologies, including, but not limited to, our inability to expand as rapidly or aggressively in the global market as our competitors, our customers ceasing to pay for innovation and competitive challenges to our products, technology and the underlying intellectual property. Our products are sold in competitive markets throughout the world. Competition is based on product features and design, brand recognition, reliability, durability, technology, breadth of product offerings, price, customer relationships and after-sale service. Although we believe that the performance and price characteristics of our products will produce competitive solutions for our customers’ needs, our products are generally priced higher than our competitors’ products. This is due to our dedication to innovation and continued investments in research and development. We believe that customers will pay for the innovations and quality in our products. However, it may be difficult for us to compete with lower priced products offered by our competitors and there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to choose our products over products offered by our competitors. If our products, markets and services are not competitive, we may experience a decline in sales volume, an increase in price discounting and a loss of market share, which would adversely impact our revenues, margin and the success of our operations. Competitors may also initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or claims, allege that we infringe upon their patents, violate our patents or they may use their resources to design comparable products that avoid infringing our patents. Regardless of whether such litigation is successful, such litigation could significantly increase our costs and divert management’s attention from the operation of our business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. | Increases in the cost of, quality, or disruption in the availability of, raw materials and components that we purchase or labor required to manufacture our products could negatively impact our operating results or financial condition. Our sales growth, expanding geographical footprint and continued use of sole-source vendors, coupled with suppliers’ potential credit issues, could lead to an increased risk of a breakdown in our supply chain. Our use of sole-source vendors creates a concentration risk. There is an increased risk of defects due to the highly configured nature of our purchased component parts that could result in quality issues, returns or production slowdowns. In addition, modularization may lead to more sole-sourced products and as we seek to outsource the design of certain key components, we risk loss of proprietary control and becoming more reliant on a sole source. There is also a risk that the vendors we choose to supply our parts and equipment fail to comply with our quality expectations, thus damaging our reputation for quality and negatively impacting sales. A global semiconductor supply shortage is impacting multiple industries and could have an impact on the production of our products, and in turn, could impact our performance in 2021. Additionally, recent disruptions of transportation, including reduced availability of containers and air transport in addition to port or border congestion, have caused, and may continue to cause, increased costs and delays in certain instances. These pressures on obtaining raw materials and shipping finished goods to customers could adversely impact our financial results. We have and may continue to experience higher than normal wage inflation due to skilled labor shortages. In addition, we have incurred costs associated with tariffs on certain raw materials used in our manufacturing processes. The labor shortages and tariff costs have unfavorably impacted our gross profit margins and could continue to do so if actions we are taking are not effective at offsetting these rising costs. Changes and uncertainties related to government fiscal and tax policies, including increased duties, tariffs, or other restrictions, could adversely affect demand for our products, the cost of the products we manufacture or our ability to cost-effectively source raw materials, all of which could have a negative impact on our financial results. Increasing cost pressures could negatively impact our ability to achieve our strategic objectives and affect our financial results. We are dependent on key suppliers to make certain materials available at a contracted price. If labor, overhead, and material costs increase, we may not be able to offset these increased manufacturing costs with a higher finished product price. We also may not be able to push those direct cost increases onto our customers in a timely manner given the competitive environment. A decline in demand for our products may have a direct impact on our ability to achieve better pricing through volume discounts. We are subject to product liability claims and product quality issues that could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacturing and distribution of our products. If products are used incorrectly by our customers, injury may result leading to product liability claims against us. Some of our products or product improvements may have defects or risks that we have not yet identified that may give rise to product quality issues, liability and warranty claims. Quality issues may also arise due to changes in parts or specifications with suppliers and/or changes in suppliers. If product liability claims are brought against us for damages that are in excess of our insurance coverage or for uninsured liabilities and it is determined we are liable, our business could be adversely impacted. Any losses we suffer from any liability claims, and the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability of our products, may have a negative impact on our business and operating results. We could experience a material design or manufacturing failure in our products, a quality system failure, other safety issues, or heightened regulatory scrutiny that could warrant a recall of some of our products. Any unforeseen product quality problems could result in loss of market share, reduced sales and higher warranty expense. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operational Risks Our ability to effectively operate our Company could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other highly skilled employees, provide employee development opportunities and create effective succession planning strategies. Our growth strategy, expanding global footprint, changing workforce demographics and increased improvements in technology and business processes designed to enhance the customer experience are putting increased pressure on human capital strategies designed to recruit, retain and develop top talent. Our continued success will depend on, among other things, the skills and services of our executive officers and other key personnel. Our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, technical, manufacturing, research, sales and marketing personnel also impacts our ability to effectively operate our business. As companies grow and increase their hiring activities, there is an inherent risk of increased employee turnover and the loss of valuable employees in key positions, especially in emerging markets. We believe the increased loss of key personnel within a concentrated region could adversely affect our sales growth. In addition, there is a risk that we may not have adequate talent acquisition resources and employee development resources to support our future hiring needs and provide training and development opportunities to all employees. This, in turn, could impede our workforce from embracing change and leveraging the improvements we have made in technology and other business process enhancements. We may not be able to develop or manage strategic planning and growth processes or the related operational plans to deliver on our strategies and establish a broad organization alignment, thereby impairing our ability to achieve future performance expectations. We are continuing to refine our global company strategy to guide our next phase of performance as our structure has become more complex due to recent acquisitions. We continue to consolidate and reallocate resources as part of our ongoing efforts to optimize our cost structure and to drive synergies and growth. Our operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to implement new processes and manage organizational changes, which include changes to our go-to-market strategy, systems and processes; simultaneous focus on expense control and growth; and introduction of alternative cleaning methods. In addition, if we do not effectively realize and sustain the benefits that these transformations are designed to produce, we may not fully realize the anticipated savings of these actions or they may negatively impact our ability to serve our customers or meet our strategic objectives. We may not be able to upgrade and evolve our information technology systems as quickly as we wish and we may encounter difficulties as we upgrade and evolve these systems to support our growth strategy and business operations, which could adversely impact our abilities to accomplish anticipated future cost savings and better serve our customers. We have many information technology systems that are important to the operation of our business and are in need of upgrading in order to effectively implement our growth strategy. Given our greater emphasis on customer-facing technologies, we may not have adequate resources to upgrade our systems at the pace which the current business environment demands. Additionally, significantly upgrading and evolving the capabilities of our existing systems could lead to inefficient or ineffective use of our technology due to lack of training or expertise in these evolving technology systems. These factors, among other things, could lead to significant expenses, adversely impacting our results of operations and hindering our ability to offer better technology solutions to our customers. | We may encounter risks to our IT infrastructure, such as access and security, that may not be adequately designed to protect critical data and systems from theft, corruption, unauthorized usage, viruses, sabotage or unintentional misuse. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to IT systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products and its customers. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, react to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. We may be unable to conduct business if we experience a significant business interruption in our computer systems, manufacturing plants or distribution facilities for a significant period of time. We rely on our computer systems, manufacturing plants and distribution facilities to efficiently operate our business. If we experience an interruption in the functionality in any of these items for a significant period of time for any reason, we may not have adequate business continuity planning contingencies in place to allow us to continue our normal business operations on a long-term basis. In addition, the increase in customer-facing technology raises the risk of a lapse in business operations. Therefore, significant long-term interruption in our business could cause a decline in sales, an increase in expenses and could adversely impact our financial results. Our ability to manage the health and safety of our global workforce may lead to increased business disruption and financial penalties. We remain focused on the health and safety measures that impact our business from a manufacturing perspective. The Company had to adjust quickly to new working conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including making enhancements as new health information was received. In the future, the Company may not adapt to new health crises quickly enough, resulting in a decrease in resource capacity and overall health and wellness of our workforce that could cause fines, reputational damage, or business disruptions. Also, there may be further enhancements and costs to the Company related to any new health guidelines and protocols. Our manufacturing teams monitor the effectiveness of our wellness and safety programs, while the Company continues to implement more tailored health initiatives for those working from home. Managing additional health guidelines and protocols for the health and safety of our employees may adversely affect our business, financial conditions or operating results.

We may consider acquisitions of suitable candidates to accomplish our growth objectives. We may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire to achieve operational efficiencies, including synergistic and other benefits of acquisition. We may consider, as part of our growth strategy, supplementing our organic growth through acquisitions of complementary businesses or products. We have engaged in acquisitions in the past and we may determine that future acquisitions may provide meaningful opportunities to grow our business and improve profitability. Acquisitions allow us to enhance the breadth of our product offerings and expand the market and geographic participation of our products and services. However, our success in growing by acquisition is dependent upon identifying businesses to acquire, integrating the newly acquired businesses with our existing businesses and complying with the terms of our credit facilities. We may incur difficulties in the realignment and integration of business activities when assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings, revenue synergies and profit margins. Acquired businesses may not achieve the levels of revenue, profit, productivity or otherwise perform as expected. We are also subject to incurring unanticipated liabilities and contingencies associated with an acquired entity that are not identified or fully understood in the due diligence process. Current or future acquisitions may not be successful or accretive to earnings if the acquired businesses do not achieve expected financial results. In addition, we may record significant goodwill or other intangible assets in connection with an acquisition. We are required to perform impairment tests at least annually and whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows. If we determine that any intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values, this could result in a charge that may be material to our operating results and financial condition. Inadequate funding or insufficient innovation of new technologies may result in an inability to develop and commercialize new innovative products and services. We strive to develop new and innovative products and services to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. New product development relies heavily on our financial and resource investments in both the short term and long term. If we fail to adequately fund product development projects or fund a project which ultimately does not gain the market acceptance we anticipated, we risk not meeting our customers' expectations, which could result in decreased revenues, declines in margin and loss of market share. | ITEM 1B – Unresolved Staff Comments None.
