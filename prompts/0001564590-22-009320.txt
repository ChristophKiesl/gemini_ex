Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts that is entitled to receive up to $450.0 million in contingent milestone payments related to our sale of ONIVYDE® to Ipsen S.A., or Ipsen, in April 2017 and up to $54.5 million in contingent milestone payments related to our sale of MM-121 and MM-111 to Elevation Oncology, Inc. (formerly known as 14ner Oncology, Inc.), or Elevation, in July 2019. We do not have any ongoing research or development activities and are seeking potential acquirers for our remaining preclinical and clinical assets. We do not have any employees and instead use external consultants for the operation of our company.
 On April 3, 2017, we completed the sale of ONIVYDE and MM-436 (the “commercial business”) to Ipsen (the “Ipsen sale”). At the time of the sale ONIVYDE was approved in the United States for the second line treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. In connection with the Ipsen sale, we are eligible to receive up to $450.0 million in additional regulatory approval-based milestone payments.
 The remaining up to $450.0 million in potential milestone payments resulting from the Ipsen sale consist of:
  
• | $225.0 million upon approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, of ONIVYDE for the first-line treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, subject to certain conditions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $150.0 million upon approval by the FDA of ONIVYDE for the treatment of small-cell lung cancer after failure of first-line chemotherapy; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $75.0 million upon approval by the FDA of ONIVYDE for an additional indication unrelated to those described above.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On May 30, 2019, we announced the completion of our review of strategic alternatives, following which our board of directors implemented a series of measures designed to extend our cash runway into 2027 and preserve our ability to capture the potential milestone payments resulting from the Ipsen sale. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our financial resources sooner than we currently expect. In connection with that announcement, we discontinued the discovery efforts on our remaining preclinical programs: MM-401, an agonistic antibody targeting a novel immuno-oncology target, TNFR2; and MM-201, a highly stabilized agonist-Fc fusion protein targeting death receptors 4 and 5. 
 The termination of our executive management team and all other employees was substantially completed by June 28, 2019 and fully completed by July 12, 2019. As of July 12, 2019, we no longer had any employees. We have engaged external consultants to run our day-to-day operations. 
 On July 12, 2019, we completed the sale to Elevation, or the Elevation sale, of our anti-HER3 antibody programs, MM-121 (seribantumab) and MM-111. In connection with the Elevation sale, we received an upfront cash payment of $3.5 million and are eligible to receive up to $54.5 million in additional potential development, regulatory approval and commercial-based milestone payments, consisting of:
 
 
• | $3.0 million for achievement of the primary endpoint in the first registrational clinical study of either MM-121 or MM-111;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | up to $16.5 million in total payments for the achievement of various regulatory approval and reimbursement-based milestones in the United States, Europe and Japan; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | up to $35.0 million in total payments for achieving various cumulative worldwide net sales targets between $100.0 million and $300.0 million for MM-121 and MM-111.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On March 27, 2020, we entered into the Celator Agreement, pursuant to which Celator agreed to purchase certain assets (the “transferred assets”), relating to certain of our preclinical nanoliposome programs, (the “Celator sale”). We completed the Celator sale simultaneously with the execution of the Celator Agreement. Under the terms of the Celator Agreement, Celator paid to us a cash payment of $2.3 million, reimbursed us for $0.2 million related to certain specified expenses and assumed certain liabilities with respect to the transferred assets. We incurred $0.4 million of expenses related to the Celator sale.
 On September 15, 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Option Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Option Agreement”) with a third party (the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which the Purchaser agreed to obtain an exclusive option (the “Option”), to purchase one of our preclinical programs with a consideration of $0.5 million. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Option Agreement, the Purchaser

paid to us the Option fee of $0.1 million. The Purchaser may exercise the Option within 24 months from September 15, 2021. We recognized a gain of $0.1 million related to the Option fee payment for the year ended December 31, 2021. Subsequent to year end, on March 1, 2022 the Purchaser exercised the Option for consideration of $0.5 million.
 We previously devoted substantially all our resources to our drug discovery and development efforts, including conducting clinical trials for our product candidates, protecting our intellectual property and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We have financed our operations primarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock, collaborations, public offerings of our securities, secured debt financings, sales of ONIVYDE and the Ipsen sale.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $14.2 million. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 will be sufficient to continue our operations into 2027, which we estimate is the latest date when the longest term potential milestones might be achieved.
We have a history of losses from our continuing operations. We do not expect to be profitable from our continuing operations in the future. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $546.1 million. Our net loss from our continuing operations was $2.5 million and $3.0 million for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We do not expect to incur any research and development expenses going forward.
 Asset Purchase Agreements
 We are party to certain asset purchase agreements which provide for potentially significant milestone payments. We consider the following agreements to be material to our business.
Ipsen
 On April 3, 2017, we completed the Ipsen sale. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2017, or the Ipsen sale agreement, between us and Ipsen, Ipsen acquired our right, title and interest in the commercial business. Pursuant to the Ipsen sale agreement, we received $575.0 million in cash, plus a working capital adjustment of $5.7 million, and are eligible to receive up to $450.0 million in additional regulatory approval-based milestone payments. Ipsen has agreed pursuant to the Ipsen sale agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop ONIVYDE in connection with obtaining the regulatory approval by the FDA of ONIVYDE for certain indications. 
Elevation 
 On July 12, 2019, we completed the sale to Elevation, or the Elevation sale, of our anti-HER3 antibody programs, MM-121 (seribantumab) and MM-111. In connection with the Elevation sale, we received an upfront cash payment of $3.5 million and are eligible to receive up to $54.5 million in additional potential development, regulatory approval and commercial-based milestone payments, consisting of:

• | $3.0 million for achievement of the primary endpoint in the first registrational clinical study of either MM-121 or MM-111;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | up to $16.5 million in total payments for the achievement of various regulatory approval and reimbursement-based milestones in the United States, Europe and Japan; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | up to $35.0 million in total payments for achieving various cumulative worldwide net sales targets between $100.0 million and $300.0 million for MM-121 and MM-111.

Intellectual Property
 We own or control a very limited number of U.S. patents and patent applications and several corresponding foreign patents and patent applications. This intellectual property relates to several early stage programs that we are no longer advancing on our own, but that may be of value to one or more potential buyer or licensees. During 2022, we will continue to evaluate the usefulness of maintaining the current patent portfolio to our business.

Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, biological products and medical devices, which does not relate directly to us, however could have an impact on Ipsen and Elevation.
Data Protection
 We are subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. We could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information in a manner that is not authorized or permitted.
Employees
 The termination of our executive management team and all other employees was substantially completed by June 28, 2019 and fully completed by July 12, 2019, subject to certain severance obligations which were paid in full in 2020. Since July 12, 2019, we no longer have any employees. We have engaged external consultants to run our day-to-day operations.
