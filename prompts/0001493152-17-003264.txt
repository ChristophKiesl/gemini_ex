ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Surna develops, designs, and distributes cultivation technologies for controlled environment agriculture (“CEA”). The Company’s customers include state-regulated cannabis cultivation facilities as well as traditional indoor agricultural facilities, including organic herb and vegetable producers.
 
Surna’s technologies include a comprehensive line of optimized lighting, environmental control, air sanitation and cultivation facilities. These technologies are designed to meet the specific environmental conditions required for indoor cultivation and to dramatically reduce energy and water consumption.
 
In addition, Surna offers mechanical design services specific to hydronic cooling including mechanical equipment and piping design.
 
Products and Services
 
Surna Chillers
 
Surna’s liquid-based process cooling system provides a more reliable and efficient thermal cooling solution compared to typical air conditioning products:
 

● | Liquid-based cooling systems are more efficient. Surna’s hydronic cooling systems and proprietary technologies rely on liquid, instead of air, as a medium for heat exchange. Surna’s systems can dramatically reduce the costs associated with cooling indoor cultivation facilities compared to traditional air conditioning products, depending on the specific environment and system design. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Redundancy is essential. Due to the high value of indoor crops like cannabis, Surna’s systems are designed to mitigate crop loss due to equipment failure. Surna’s chillers are easily scalable and allow for redundant system design for a nominal increase in cost relative to ducted systems. 
● | Closed-loop cooling systems reduce opportunities for contamination. Surna’s system provides for room isolation during the heat exchange process, thereby reducing the risk of cross-contamination between rooms. Surna’s system uses chilled water delivered through a closed loop and does not require ducting. Traditional air conditioning systems use ducted air for heat removal, which disseminate contaminants between rooms. This greatly increases the risk of spreading the contamination throughout the entire grow space. 

Surna Reflectors
 
Surna’s reflector optimizes light delivery to the plant canopy. Thanks to the reflector’s internal technology, the bulb is able to produce up to 9.1% more usable light without any increase in energy consumption. Light-on-target reflectivity is also increased due to the unique design and shape of the reflector, eliminating light wasted illuminating walls and aisles. The water-cooled version uses a unique automation protocol to employ “point-source” heat removal drastically reducing the energy required to capture and remove the heat generated by the bulb.
 
Bio-Security
 
Surna offers a full-service air sanitation technology program for mold and mildew risk mitigation to cultivators. This program uses a combination of site monitoring and photocatalytic oxidation equipment to maintain facility standards while destroying harmful airborne microbes without the production of byproducts.

Services
 
Surna provides a full-service engineering package for designing and engineering commercial scale thermodynamic systems specific to indoor grow facility conditions. Once the design is complete, Surna’s project management team oversees its customers’ installation through system commissioning. Surna’s on-site commissioning program is designed to ensure that the target environment is achieved. Surna then offers an ongoing maintenance plan to maintain the integrity of the system through regularly scheduled visits with a goal of keeping its customers’ system operating at peak performance.
Automation
 
Surna understands the importance of maintaining a consistent grow environment and as such seeks to provide “smart” equipment with onboard intelligence allowing the cultivator the ability to automate its system. Employing a number of technologies, Surna’s building automation controls can be scaled to address a variety of customer needs and expectations. From simple environment measuring devices to full scale system automation, Surna believes it understands the needs of the cultivator.
Hybrid Building
 
Surna’s comprehensive cultivation facility (“Hybrid Building”) combines the advantages of a greenhouse with those of an indoor grow operation for indoor cultivators seeking efficiency and accelerated time to market. The Hybrid Building uses the sun as its primary light source and high power LED lights for supplemental lighting while maintaining the environmental and security controls of an indoor facility. Surna’s technology is employed into this one fully operational building seeking to give the grower the best technology available on the market today.
Product Development
 
Surna places a priority on new product development and improvement both through its internal product development staff and in partnerships with other commercial entities. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Company spent $349,000 towards the development of new products in the areas of lighting, climate control, bio-security, water purification, system automation and the hybrid building.
Intellectual Property
 
Surna relies on a combination of patent and trademark rights, trade secrets, laws that protect intellectual property, confidentiality procedures, and contractual restrictions with its employees and others to establish and protect its intellectual property rights. As of March 31, 2017, the Company has eight pending patent applications and four issued patents. The pending patent applications are a combination of PCT, utility and design patent applications that are directed to certain core Company technology. The Company’s four issued patents are U.S. design patents related to the Company’s reflector. The U.S. design patents provide protection for 14 years from the date of issue. Utility patents provide protection for 20 years from the earliest non-provisional application filing date. The Company has registered trademark registrations around its core brand (“Surna”) in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions, as well as the Surna logo and the combined Surna logo and name in the United States. Our wordmark is also registered in the European Union and is pending registration in Canada. These are contained in three trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). Subject to ongoing use and renewal, trademark protection is potentially perpetual.
 
Operating segments
 
Surna currently operates in one primary business segment, which encompasses designing, manufacturing, and distributing indoor climate control systems, including but not limited to chillers, lights, reflectors, and irrigation systems, for use in conjunction with the state-regulated cannabis and CEA industry.
 
Competition
 
Surna’s chilled water system products and services compete with various national and local HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) providers who traditionally resell, design, and implement climate control systems for comfort cooling of schools, offices, or other large buildings. Surna differs from these competitors by providing hydronic cooling systems tailored specifically for managing the distinct challenges in connection with the significant heat and humidity loads associated with cultivation of indoor crops.
 
Surna’s dehumidification products face competition from other dehumidification manufacturers. Surna provides its customers and clients with dehumidification options that it believes are more cost effective and more efficient at removing humidity than its competitors in the indoor cultivation space.

Surna believes that few manufacturers of these products have expertise in the cannabis market and understand the needs of growers. Surna, however, is equipped to customize products for the cannabis market and advise growers on appropriate products to maximize crop yield. The Company expects increased competition in both the climate control and services divisions in the cannabis sector as an increasing number of states legalize the cultivation, distribution, and consumption of the crop.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2017, Surna has 28 full-time employees. The Company may, however, utilize and has in the past utilized the services of a number of consultants, independent contractors, and professionals. Additional employees will be hired in the future depending on need and the Company’s expansion.
Government Regulation
 
Surna’s chillers are subject to state and municipal regulations regarding energy-efficiency standards often incorporated into building codes. Many states and municipalities have adopted some version of Standard 90.1 as published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (“ASHRAE”); however, some states and municipalities have or may in the future adopt alternative standards that may be more or less restrictive than Standard 90.1. Similarly, Standard 90.1 is itself regularly updated—most recently in 2013. Each update of the standard generally reflects the availability of increasingly efficient technologies, resulting in stricter energy-efficiency requirements. The Company anticipates that its products will comply with these standards. With every product line, Surna offers a product that meets or exceeds the Standard 90.1.
 
Otherwise, the Company is subject substantially to the same government regulations that affect businesses generally. See, however, Item 1A - Risk Factors – “U.S. Federal and foreign regulation and enforcement may adversely affect the implementation of marijuana laws and regulations may negatively impact our revenue and profit or we could be found to be violating the Controlled Substances Act or other U.S. federal, state or foreign laws,” “Litigation by states affected by marijuana legalization,” “Variations in state and local regulation and enforcement in states that have legalized cannabis that may restrict marijuana-related activities, including activities related to cannabis, may negatively impact our revenue and profit,” and “We and our customers may have difficulty accessing the services of banks, which may make it difficult to sell our products and services.”
