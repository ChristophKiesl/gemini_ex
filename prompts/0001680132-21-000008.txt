Stock Transfer Agreement

On May 31, 2019, the President of the Company, Suneetha Nandana Silva Sudusinghe, on behalf of the Company entered into a Stock Transfer Agreement with Cecillia Merige Jensen whereby the Company acquired through merger all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Cannabis Suisse LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company (Subsidiary). In exchange, Ms. Jensen received 10,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company from Mr. Sudusinghe. Mr. Sudusinghes share ownership in the Company has been reduced from 17,400,000 to 7,400,000 shares. Immediately prior to the above-mentioned transaction, the Company had 34,500,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and immediately after the above-mentioned transaction, the Company had 34,500,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

The Subsidiary owns all of the capital stock of Grow Factory GmbH (Grow Factory), a limited liability company incorporated in Zurich, Switzerland March 13, 2017. Its registered office space is located at Lerzenstrasse 12, 8953 Dietikon, Switzerland. Grow Factory is a fully licensed cannabis cultivation and distribution company in Switzerland for recreational tobacco products and medical CBD oils and commenced its operations in March 2018. 

Product Overview

The main business of the Company is cultivation and distribution of cannabis and the related products. Switzerland has the highest allowed legislative Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content in Europe (1%) for sales of cannabis products in retail outlets (without medical receipt). This condition makes Switzerland a perfect geographic location for manufacturing cannabis products and intending to scale the business into worldwide distribution.

Various diluted sequences of THC/CBD ratio can be produced to match legislation and regulation on individual markets with other permitted levels of THC. It enables worldwide production of OTC (over-the-counter) products - for example CBD oils, as well as retail branded cannabis cigarettes, and other health related supplements. 

The growing process has been streamed online on the website https://www.cannabissuisse.com since June 25, 2019.

Grow Factory is distributing 4 gr. and 12 gr. flowerhead packages under the brand name of Alpine Cannabis. They are distributed to 40 CBD sales places in Switzerland and various tank stations on the border between Italy and Switzerland. There are two different forms of packaging: a 12-gr box for the price of 44 CHF and a 4-gr box for the price of 22 CHF. A 12-gr box is specially made for about 40 special CBD stores in Switzerland, where the product is scheduled to come into immediately after production. A 4-gr box is meant for selling in tank stations on the border between Switzerland and Italy. 

Another line of products is Alpine Cannabis CBD Pure Base being an e-liquid base for electronic cigarettes. It provides a boost of CBD to any favorite e-liquids and is available with various degrees of CBD strengths. Alpine Cannabis CBD Pure Base provides: certified CBD concentration in 10 ml bottles; guaranteed absence of THC & totally nicotine-free e-liquid base; no alcohol and no animal extracts; U.S. pharmacopeia/food grade ingredients; tamper-proof and childproof package; diacetyl free and quality-controlled production. The product contains 100% of propylene glycol and various levels of CBD, such as 100mg, 300mg and 500mg per 10 ml bottle, and 200mg, 500mg and 1000mg per 30 ml bottle. The prices range from ˆ19.00 for Alpine Cannabis CBD PURE BASE 100 mg 10 ml bottles to ˆ89.00 for Alpine Cannabis CBD PURE BASE 1000 mg 30 ml bottles. 

The Company is also engaged in production of pre-rolled cannabis joints based on the V1 Cannabis Strain. They are wrapped in premium quality paper from RAW (rolling papers) brand and are made only of quality fresh buds (no leaves) cultivated with non-pesticide fertilizers and biological control agents. The new product line of handmade pre-rolled CBD joints contains no additives. They are free from pesticides, fungicides, heavy metals or nicotine. Cannabis Suisse is the first company in Switzerland to offer this uniquely blended fusion of organic cones with optimally boosted CBD content. The THC level is naturally kept under 1%. CBD flower pre-rolled joints are an all-natural alternative to CBD oil products. They offer pain-relieving, calming, and anti-inflammatory properties.

Market background 

In August 2018, Forbes magazine listed Switzerland as the third most overlooked marijuana market in the world.

Cannabis users from California, Colorado, Arizona, Oregon, and Washington spent around $36 million in pre-rolled joints only in May of 2019 according to the report introduced by BDS Analytics. (https://bdsa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/CPI-Template-May.pdf) Apart from that, at the end of 2019, the Swiss government finally removed the 25% tobacco tax which was a significant event for the country. In five years from now, Europe is expected to become the largest legal cannabis market in the world. In 2019, the industry there has grown more than in the last six years together.

Some European countries like Germany, Denmark, Malta, Greece, and Italy discussed the possibility of creating a completely regulated cannabis market by 2028. Furthermore, Luxembourg intends to introduce a regulated market for adult use of cannabis by 2023.

The research conducted by the Brightfield Group, and based on impending regulatory changes in EU, indicates that the European CBD market is expected to be worth $1.7 billion by 2023. The cannabis market in general is also set to experience rapid growth, from $318 million in 2018 to nearly $8 billion by 2023.

Competition

We acknowledge the market of CBD-related items is rather competitive. There are several companies that offer comparative items and we have to compete with them. We see the main competitive advantage of our competitors is the established customer base and marketing outlets. Nevertheless, we arrange on a wholesale exchange, for the most part, so we have capacity to offer our items for extensive organizations in huge amounts. Therefore, we believe our item is more extensive, the quality is better, and our ways to deal with business are more flexible.

The Swiss market has a few big competitors now, the rest are small farms with under 1,000 plants in production and mostly outdoor. The big farms have more than 20,000 plants in indoor growing and from 10 to 50 Acres of outdoor growing. With the indoor growing, it is very difficult to get good quality harvest, so a lot of small farms were closed in 2018 as it was difficult to make a profit with farms of 1,000 -3,000 plants. 

Grow Factory has growers with many years of indoor growing experience. This results in the Company making about 20-grams of high-quality flower heads per plant over an 8-week period. It is quite difficult to find a landlord in Switzerland for indoor grow who accepts CBD production. Currently Grow Factory rents the territory of 400 m2. It is not enough for the further development so the Company needs an approval for the new 4000 m2 place which is planned to be available soon.

The prices on weed have been decreasing in Switzerland, so in order to get a part of the market, Grow Factory has to reduce the price and produce more hemp. A 12 gr flowerhead box generally costs 50 CF, so Grow Factory will sell 1 gr more than their competitors do for 50 CF and we believe the product is of a much higher quality. We believe Grow Factory will get a huge part of the CBD market when it is known by the customers. A 4 gr flowerhead box costs 22 CF. Competitors sell 3 or 3.5 gr boxes at the same price. Sales price for Grow Factory products will not increase a lot. It is more important for the Company to get well-known and branded in Switzerland.

Marketing

We use marketing strategies such as web advertisements, press releases, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We attract traffic to our website by a variety of online marketing tactics, such as registering with top search engines, using selected key words and meta-tags, and utilizing link and banner exchange options. 

The website related to cannabis cultivation is https://www.cannabissuisse.com. The growing process is streamed online on this website. Also, it includes the information about the main Companys products, our team and our plans for further development.

We will intend to continue our marketing efforts during the life of our operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and more importantly retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue and to successfully protect ourselves against those risks, then it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed.
