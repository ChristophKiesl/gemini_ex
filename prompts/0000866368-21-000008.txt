The Company

PS Business Parks, Inc. (“PSB”) is a fully-integrated, self-advised and self-managed REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant industrial, flex and office space. As of December 31, 2020, PSB owned and operated 27.7 million rentable square feet of commercial space, comprising 98 business parks and 675 buildings located in California, Texas, Virginia, Florida, Maryland, and Washington. PSB focuses on owning concentrated business parks, which provides us with the greatest flexibility to meet the needs of our customers. PSB also held a controlling interest in the following joint venture arrangements, both located in Tysons, Virginia: a 95.0% interest in Highgate at the Mile, a 395-unit multifamily apartment complex, and a 98.2% interest in Brentford at the Mile, a 411-unit multifamily apartment complex development. PSB manages 0.4 million rentable square feet on behalf of Public Storage (“PS”).

Substantially all of PSB’s assets are held, and its business is conducted, through PS Business Parks, L.P. (the “OP”), a California limited partnership. As of December 31, 2020, PSB owned 79.0% of the common partnership units of PS Business Parks, L.P. (the “OP”). The remaining common partnership units are owned by PS. PSB, as the sole general partner of the OP, has full, exclusive and complete responsibility and discretion in managing and controlling the OP. PS also owns 7.2 million common shares and would own 41.6% (or 14.5 million shares) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock if it redeemed its common partnership units for common shares. 

Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references to “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and similar references mean PS Business Parks, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the OP and our consolidated joint ventures.

History of the Company: The Company was formed in 1990 as a California corporation. Through a series of transactions between January 1997 and March 1998, the Company was renamed “PS Business Parks, Inc.” and became a publicly held, fully integrated, self-advised and self-managed REIT having interests in commercial real estate held through our OP.

Principal Business Activities

We are a commercial property landlord, with 98 business parks consisting of multi-tenant industrial, flex and office space. The Company owns 18.4 million square feet of industrial space that is primarily configured as warehouse space with ample dock access. We own 6.2 million square feet of flex space, representing industrial buildings that are 

 
configured with a combination of warehouse and office space that can be designed to fit a wide variety of use types. The warehouse component of the flex space has a number of uses including light manufacturing and assembly, storage and warehousing, showroom, laboratory, distribution and research and development activities. The office component of flex space is complementary to the warehouse component by enabling businesses to accommodate management and production staff in the same facility. In addition, the Company owns 3.1 million square feet of low-rise office space, generally either in business parks that combine office buildings with industrial and/or flex buildings or in submarkets where the market demand is more office focused.

We generally seek to own and operate multi-tenant buildings in multi-building business parks which accommodate various businesses and uses. Our business parks average 14 buildings and 0.8 million rentable square feet per park, located on parcels of various sizes, ranging from 1 to 49 buildings and 12,000 to 3.5 million square feet of rentable space. Parking at most of our parks is open but in some instances is covered. The ratio of parking spaces to rentable square feet generally ranges from two to six per thousand square feet depending upon the use of the property and its location. Office space generally requires a greater parking ratio than most industrial uses. 

The customer base for our facilities is diverse. For certain operational performance metrics, we bifurcate our facilities into those with average unit sizes over 5,000 square feet and those with average unit sizes under 5,000 square feet given that the nature of the customer base and use types differ between the two, which can result in varying performance. Approximately 35.9% of in-place rents as of December 31, 2020 were derived from customers at properties with average unit sizes under 5,000 square feet. The remaining 64.1% of in-place rents came from customers at properties with average unit sizes over 5,000 square feet. The Company also has several customers that lease space in multiple buildings and locations. As of December 31, 2020, the U.S. Government is the largest customer with 21 separate leases encompassing approximately 657,000 square feet and 3.8% of the Company’s annualized rental income. 

We operate in six states and we may expand our operations to other states or reduce the number of states in which we operate. Properties are acquired for both income and capital appreciation potential, and we place no limitation on the amount that can be invested in any specific property. 

The Company owns approximately 14.0 acres and 6.4 acres of land in Dallas and Northern Virginia, respectively, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as land and building held for development. The Company will seek to develop these parcels and possibly seek redevelopment of other assets in the future. 

During 2020, we developed an 83,000 square foot shallow-bay industrial building at our Freeport Business Park in Irving, Texas, on 4.0 of the 14.0 acres located in the Dallas submarket. As of December 31, 2020, $7.8 million of the estimated $8.1 million total development costs had been incurred and was reflected under land and building held for development, net on our consolidated balance sheets. The remaining $0.3 million of development cost was incurred subsequent to December 31, 2020 and construction was completed in January 2021.

See “Objectives and Strategies” below for further information.

Recent Company Developments 

Acquisition of Real Estate Facilities: On October 28, 2020, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial park comprising approximately 246,000 rentable square feet in Alexandria, Virginia, for a total purchase price of $46.6 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of three buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 7,000 to 75,000 square feet.

On January 10, 2020, we acquired a multi-tenant industrial park comprising approximately 73,000 rentable square feet in La Mirada, California, for a total purchase price of $13.5 million, inclusive of capitalized transaction costs. The park consists of five buildings and was 100.0% occupied at acquisition with suites ranging from 1,200 to 3,000 square feet. 
‎


Development of Multifamily Real Estate: In 2019, we successfully rezoned our 44.5 acre office and multifamily park, known as The Mile, located in Tysons, Virginia. The rezoning will allow us to develop, at our election, up to 3,000 additional multifamily units and approximately 500,000 square feet of other commercial uses. We leveraged the expertise of a well-regarded local developer and operator of multifamily real estate to develop our first multifamily development at The Mile, a 395-unit multifamily property known as Highgate at The Mile, which completed in 2017. In August 2020, the Company entered into a new joint venture agreement with the same well-regarded local developer for the purpose of developing our second multifamily property, Brentford at The Mile, a planned 411-unit multifamily apartment complex. Construction of Brentford at The Mile commenced in August 2020 and is anticipated to be completed over a period of 24 to 36 months at an estimated development cost of $110 million to $115 million, excluding land cost. There could be several phases of the development at The Mile beyond that, but the scope, timing and construction of all future phases of development of The Mile are subject to a variety of uncertainties, including site plan approvals and building permits. See “Objectives and Strategies” below for further information regarding our development and redevelopment activities.

Sales of Real Estate Facilities: On September 16, 2020, the Company sold two industrial buildings totaling 40,000 square feet located in Redmond, Washington, which were subject to an eminent domain process for net proceeds of $11. million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $7.7 million. 

On January 7, 2020, the Company completed the sale of a single-tenant building totaling 113,000 square feet in Montgomery County, Maryland, for net sale proceeds of $29.3 million, which resulted in a gain on sale of $19.6 million. 


Tax and Corporate Structure

For all periods presented herein, we have elected REIT status under the Code. For each taxable year in which we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our “REIT taxable income” (generally, taxable income subject to specified adjustments, including a deduction for dividends paid and excluding our net capital gain) that is distributed to our shareholders. We believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to qualify as a REIT. 

PSB is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), with substantially all of our activities conducted through the OP. We acquired interests in certain properties from PS during PSB’s initial formation in exchange for operating partnership units, which allowed PS to defer the recognition of a tax gain on the contributed properties. 

We are the sole general partner of the OP, which has equity in the form of common partnership units and preferred partnership units. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 79.0% of the common partnership units of the OP and 100% of the preferred partnership units. The remainder of the common partnership units are owned by PS. The common units owned by PS may be redeemed, subject to certain limitations, for shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis or, at our option, an equivalent value in cash. 

The Company’s interest in the OP entitles it to share in cash distributions from, and the profits and losses of, the OP in proportion to the Company’s economic interest in the OP (apart from tax allocations of profits and losses to take into account pre-contribution property appreciation or depreciation). The Company, since 1998, has paid per share dividends on its common and preferred stock that track, on a one-for-one basis, the amount of per unit cash distributions the Company receives from the OP in respect of the common and preferred partnership units in the OP that are owned by the Company. 

As the general partner of the OP, the Company has the exclusive responsibility under the Operating Partnership Agreement to manage and conduct the business of the OP. 

Common Officers and Directors with PS

Ronald L. Havner, Jr., Chairman of the Company, is also the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of PS. Joseph D. Russell, Jr. is a director of the Company and also President and Chief Executive Officer of PS. Kristy M. Pipes, an independent director of the Company, is also a trustee of PS and Gary E. Pruitt, an independent director of the Company, was also a trustee of PS until he retired from the Board of Trustees of PS in January 2021. Other employees of PS render services to the Company pursuant to a cost sharing and administrative services agreement.‎

 

Services Provided to and by PS

We manage industrial, office, and retail facilities in the United States for PS under either the “Public Storage” or “PS Business Parks” names (the “PS Management Agreement”). Under PS’s supervision, we coordinate and assist in rental and marketing activities, property maintenance and other operational activities, including the selection of vendors, suppliers, employees and independent contractors. Management fee revenue derived from the PS Management Agreement totaled $0.3 million, $0.3 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. These amounts are included in “interest and other income” on our consolidated statements of income.

PS also provides property management services for the self-storage component of two assets owned by the Company. Management fee expenses under the contract were $0.1 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. These amounts are included under “cost of operations” on our consolidated statements of income.

Pursuant to a cost sharing agreement, we share certain administrative services, corporate office space, and certain other third party costs with PS which are allocated based upon fair and reasonable estimates of the cost of the services expected to be provided. We reimbursed PS $1.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 for costs paid on our behalf, while PS reimbursed us less than $0.1 million for costs we incurred on their behalf for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Competition

Our properties compete for tenants with similar properties located in our markets primarily on the basis of location, rental rate, services provided and the design and condition of improvements. Competition in the market areas we operate in is significant and has from time to time negatively impacted occupancy levels and rental rates of, and increased the operating expenses of, certain of our properties. The demand for space in our markets is impacted by general economic conditions, which can affect the local competition for tenants. Sublease space and unleased developments have from time to time created competition among operators in certain markets in which the Company operates. Refer to “Management Discussion and Analysis—Analysis of Net Income” for a discussion of trends in our occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses. 
Objectives and Strategies

Our primary objective is to grow shareholder value in a risk appropriate and stable manner by maximizing net cash flow generated by our existing properties, as well as prudently seeking opportunities for growth through acquisitions and development with attractive risk-adjusted returns on invested capital. 

We seek to maximize net cash flow of our existing properties by optimizing occupancy levels and rental rates, while minimizing capital expenditures and leasehold improvements. Below are the primary elements of our strategy:

Concentration in favorable markets: We believe that our properties generally are located in markets that have favorable characteristics such as above average population, job, and income growth, as well as high education levels. In addition, we believe our business parks are generally in markets with higher than average barriers to entry that are close to critical infrastructure, middle to high income housing or universities and have easy access to major transportation arteries. We believe that these characteristics contribute to property operating cash flow stability and growth. 

‎


Standard build outs and finishes: We generally seek to configure our rentable space with standard buildouts and finishes that meet the needs of a wide variety of tenants, minimizing the need for specialized and costly tenant improvements and enabling space to be “move-in ready” quickly upon vacancy. We believe this makes our space more attractive to potential tenants, allows tenants to move in quickly and seamlessly, and reduces the cost of capital improvements, relative to real estate operators that offer specialized finishes or build outs. Also, such flexibility facilitates our ability to offer diverse sizes and configurations to meet potential customer’s needs, as well as to change space sizes for existing customers when their needs change. 

Large, Diverse Parks: Our business parks are generally concentrated in large complexes of diverse buildings, with a variety of available space sizes and configurations that we can offer to tenants. We believe that this allows us to attract a greater number of potential tenants to our parks and minimizes the loss of existing customers when their space requirements change. 

Smaller tenants and diverse tenant base with shorter-term leases: By concentrating on smaller spaces, we seek to reach a large number of smaller tenants in the market. We believe this focus gives us a competitive edge as most institutional owners focus primarily on large users. Small users perceive more incremental value from the level of customer service that we offer. We also believe having smaller tenants improves our diversity of tenants across industries, which improves the stability of our cash flows. In addition, our lease term tends to be short, generally an average of three and a half years, which we believe allows us to more quickly capture increases in market rents in our high-growth markets. At December 31, 2020, our average suite size was approximately 5,000 rentable square feet and we had only four customers – the U.S. Government, Amazon Inc., KZ Kitchen Cabinet & Stone, and Luminex Corporation – representing more than 1% of our annualized rental income. 

Decentralized operating strategy: Our local management teams are empowered, within a prescribed decision and metrics framework, to make many leasing and capital decisions in a manner which we believe maximizes the return on investment on lease transactions. We believe this decentralized approach allows us to be more nimble and efficient in our decision making, and more effectively price and market our space, relative to a more centralized approach. 

Superior Service to Customers: We seek to provide a superior level of service to our customers in order to maintain occupancy and increase rental rates, as well as minimize customer turnover. The Company’s property management offices are located on-site, helping the Company maintain its properties and providing customers with convenient access to management, while conveying a sense of quality, order and security. We believe that our personnel are among the most experienced and effective real estate professionals in our markets. The Company has significant experience in acquiring properties managed by others and thereafter improving customer satisfaction, occupancy levels, retention rates and rental income by implementing established customer service programs. 

In addition, we seek to expand through acquisitions or development activities that generate attractive returns on invested capital, as follows:

Acquire facilities in targeted markets at prudent price levels: We have a disciplined capital allocation approach, seeking to purchase properties at prices that are not in excess of the cost to develop similar facilities (i.e. replacement cost), which we believe reduces our risk and maximizes long term returns. We seek generally to acquire in our existing markets, which we believe have favorable growth characteristics. We also believe acquiring in our existing markets leverages our operating efficiencies. We would consider expanding to additional markets with similar favorable characteristics of our existing markets, if we could acquire sufficient scale. 

Redevelop existing real estate facilities: Certain of our existing business parks were developed in or near areas that have been undergoing gentrification with an influx of residential development, and, as a result, certain buildings in our business parks may have higher and better uses. We will seek to identify potential candidates for redevelopment within our portfolio, and where appropriate will leverage the expertise and scale of existing operators and developers should we pursue redevelopment of any of our properties. For example, at The Mile in Tysons, Virginia, we demolished an existing building and developed Highgate at The Mile, a 395-unit apartment building, with a joint venture partner. In 2019, we successfully rezoned the remainder of The Mile, allowing us to pursue the development of additional multifamily and mixed use projects. In 2020, we demolished a vacant office building and began developing our second multifamily property, Brentford at The Mile, a planned 411-unit multifamily apartment complex with the same joint venture partner. There can be no assurance as to the level of additional redevelopment opportunities throughout our portfolio in the future.

‎


Financing Strategy

Overview of financing strategy and sources of capital: As a REIT, we generally distribute all of our “REIT taxable income” to our shareholders each year, which relative to a taxable C corporation, limits the amount of cash flow from operations that we can retain for investment purposes. As a result, in order to expand our asset base, access to capital is important. 

Our financial profile is characterized by strong credit metrics, including low leverage relative to our total capitalization and operating cash flows. Our credit profile and ratings enable us to effectively access both the public and private capital markets to raise capital. We will seek to maintain our current credit profile and ratings. 

Sources of capital available to us include retained cash flow, the issuance of preferred and common equity, the issuance of medium and long-term debt, joint venture financing, the sale of existing properties, and borrowing off our revolving line of credit. 

Historically, we have financed our cash investment activities primarily with retained operating cash flow and the issuance of preferred equity. 

We select from the sources of capital available to us based upon relative cost, availability, desired leverage levels, nature of the investment opportunities for which the capital will be used, as well as other factors such as the impact of covenants in the case of debt. 

Retained Operating Cash Flow: Although we are required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our “REIT taxable income” each year, we have nonetheless been able to retain operating cash flow to the extent that our tax depreciation exceeds our capital expenditures. In recent years, we have retained between $40 to $60 million in operating cash flow per year. 

Preferred Equity: We view preferred equity as an important source of capital over the long term. We have historically favored preferred equity as a source of capital due to the low interest rate and refinancing risk as the dividend rate is fixed for life and it never matures. In addition, the consequences of defaulting on required preferred distributions are less severe than with debt. However, rates and market conditions for the issuance of preferred securities can be volatile or inefficient from time to time. As of December 31, 2020, we have $944.8 million in preferred securities outstanding with an average coupon rate of 5.10%.

Medium or long-term debt: In addition to borrowing from our revolving line of credit, we may seek to issue term debt in the future in an effort to diversify our sources of capital. We may consider issuance in the public bond market or private placement of senior unsecured debt depending on the nature and timing of the associated use of capital.

Common equity: We believe that the market for our common equity is liquid and, as a result, common equity is a viable potential source of capital. 

Tax advantaged equity: As noted above, we have the ability to offer common or preferred operating partnership units with economic characteristics that are similar to our common and preferred stock, but provide the seller the opportunity to defer the recognition of a tax gain. 

Credit Facility: We have a $250.0 million unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Credit Facility”), which we use from time to time as temporary financing, along with short-term bank loans when necessary, until we are able to replace it with longer-term capital. As of December 31, 2020, there was no balance outstanding on our Credit Facility and we had no short-term bank loans. 

Investments in Real Estate Facilities

As of December 31, 2020, the Company owned and operated 27.7 million rentable square feet comprising 98 business parks in six states compared to 27.6 million rentable square feet comprising 97 business parks in six states as of December 31, 2019. The Company also held a 95.0% interest in a 395-unit multifamily apartment complex as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, and a 98.2% interest in a 411-unit multifamily apartment complex development as of December 31, 2020.

‎


Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates

The Company’s Restated Bylaws provide that the Company may engage in transactions with affiliates provided that a purchase or sale transaction with an affiliate is (i) approved by a majority of the Company’s independent directors and (ii) fair to the Company based on an independent appraisal or fairness opinion.

Insurance

The Company believes that its properties are adequately insured. Facilities operated by the Company have historically been covered by comprehensive insurance, including fire, earthquake, wind damage and liability coverage from nationally recognized carriers, subject to customary deductibles. 
Compliance with Government Regulations

We are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including various federal, state and local regulations that apply generally to the ownership of real property and the operation of such properties. These include various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters, labor matters and employee safety and health matters. Further, all of our properties must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and with related regulations, which generally requires that buildings be made accessible to persons with disabilities. Various state laws impose similar requirements. In addition, we must operate our properties in compliance with numerous local fire and safety regulations, building codes, zoning requirements and other land use regulations. We are not aware of any government regulations that have resulted or that we expect will result in compliance costs that had or will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. See “We must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, fire and safety regulations and zoning requirements, which can require significant expenditures” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further information regarding our risks related to government regulations. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, our properties and our customers have been subject to public-health regulations that have impacted our operations and our business. See “We are subject to risks from the COVID-19 pandemic and we may in the future be subject to risks from other public health crises.” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further information regarding these regulations. We are also subject to the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which amends and expands the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). The CPRA, which goes into effect on January 1, 2023, provides new rights and amends existing rights found in the CCPA and also creates a new privacy enforcement authority, the California Privacy Protection Agency (“CalPPA”). The CPRA grants the Attorney General and the CalPPA the authority to issue regulations on a wide range of topics. We are not aware of any current privacy requirements that have resulted or that we expect will result in compliance costs that had or will have a material effect on our business practices that could increase costs or reduce revenues. Other states have also considered or are considering privacy laws similar to those passed in California. Similar laws may be implemented in other jurisdictions that we do business in and in ways that may be more restrictive than those in California. See “We are subject to laws and governmental regulations and actions that affect our operating results and financial condition.” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further information regarding our risks related to this regulation.

We are committed to a long-term environmental stewardship program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment and the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns, including environmentally-friendly capital initiatives and building and operating properties with a high structural resilience and low obsolescence. We accrue environmental assessments and estimated remediation costs when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. Our current practice is to conduct environmental investigations in connection with property acquisitions. Although there can be no assurance, we are not aware of any environmental contamination of any of our facilities, which individually or in the aggregate would be material to our overall business, financial condition, or results of operations. Compliance with laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those regarding the discharge of material into the environment, has not had any material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company. See “We may incur significant environmental remediation costs” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further information regarding our risks related to government regulations.

Human Capital Management 

The Company’s human capital management objectives are to attract, retain, and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company develops its employees to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future and fosters a team-oriented culture aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive. The Company works to acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing and diverse workforce that is empowered to make thoughtful decisions, eager to collaborate, and motivated to provide a high level of service to our customers. The Company employed 155 people as of December 31, 2020, comprised 

 
primarily of personnel engaged in property operations. Our Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee oversees our sustainability efforts, including our environmental, social, and governance initiatives.

Diversity and Inclusion: At PSB, we strive to create a diverse and inclusive environment where all employees feel valued, included, and excited to be part of our team. For example, we strive to include a subset of diverse candidates as we seek to fill open positions. With team members from all different races, backgrounds, and life experiences, we celebrate inclusion and value the diversity each person brings to PSB. Our employee population is approximately 50% female, with 30% in a supervisory role, and approximately 43% have self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander, Asian, Black or African American, or of two or more races, with 24% in a supervisory role. Our workforce also has generational diversity: 54% millennials (aged 24-42), 25% generation X (aged 43-54), and 21% baby boomers (aged 55-73).

Compensation Policies: PSB believes in aligning employee compensation with our short- and long-term performance goals and to provide compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate, and retain employees who are crucial to our success. We tailor our compensation programs to each employee group to ensure competitiveness in the market and to drive employee engagement. The Company provides the opportunity for employees to own a part of the Company through equity grants for senior members of our team, with nearly 65% of our exempt employees having received equity grants in the form of restricted stock units or stock option awards. 

Health and Wellness: PSB is committed to its employees’ overall health and well-being. We want to help them feel happy, healthy, socially connected, and purposeful. Our goal is to provide tools and resources to help empower our employees to explore what they need and to evaluate for themselves what makes sense in achieving a healthy and balanced lifestyle. We partner with our health care provider to promote health and wellness programs to incentivize our employees to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle.

We provide benefits to all of our employees and dependents, including medical, dental, vision, flexible and health savings accounts, and income protection plans. We also offer a 401(k) plan with matching employer contributions to help our employees prepare for retirement. 

Supporting Our Employees During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The COVID-19 pandemic brought varying challenges to each of our team members. We took a multipronged approach in providing resources, tools and added protocols that focused on the safety of employees and their families while still allowing us to support the customers we serve during these unprecedented times. For example, our field operations and business park protocols were quickly modified to ensure a safe workspace. Additionally, we had a swift transition to work-from-home for our entire workforce, where applicable, by utilizing various existing technology platforms and implementing new technologies necessary to accommodate the situation. We provided additional incentive pay for certain personnel. Additionally, we provided an employee assistance program, which offers employees mental health, financial, and legal support to assist them in their well-being during these unique times. 

Training, Development, and Recognition: We hire and develop outstanding team members to lease and manage all of our properties and deliver market-leading service to our customers. Our decentralized, vertically integrated platform gives us the flexibility to meet the needs of our customers, react quickly to local market dynamics, and contain operating expenses and capital expenditures, and allows us to keep all property management and leasing activity in-house, maximize cost efficiencies, and speed up decision making. 

We offer training programs for new team members and ongoing training and development programs for our entire workforce. We are able to accomplish this, in part, by utilizing an online platform that provides a central repository for accessing training courses and reference materials. We also reinforce our Company culture by celebrating major accomplishments, stand-out performances, and individual milestones through various recurring recognition programs and events throughout the year, and offer incentive programs designed to recognize and reward outstanding achievements. We work towards development of our employees and creating opportunities for them to advance. For example, where and when possible, we seek to fill open positions with internal candidates. 

Communication and Engagement: Given our decentralized platform, it is important for us to ensure that team members feel they are informed and included. We communicate through various channels such as recurring meetings, frequent email communications and updates from management, Company intranet postings, and engagement surveys. Employee engagement is instrumental in understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of our strategies. We actively solicit input from our employees on how the Company can better achieve its goals, including through employee surveys that give us feedback and help us measure commitment, motivation and engagement. 



Community and Social Impact: We encourage employees to give back to our communities by providing two “volunteer” days to all employees annually which can be used by participating in group volunteer events or individually. We also offer a charitable gift matching program, providing a donation match up to the preset limit per employee annually to qualifying 501(c)(3) organizations.
