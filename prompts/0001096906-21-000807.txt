Item 1. Description of Business
Company Background
 
Cannabis Sativa, Inc., formerly named Ultra Sun Corporation, was incorporated under laws of Nevada in November 2005.  In 2019, we conducted our operations through our subsidiaries PrestoCorp, Inc. (“PrestoCorp”), a 51% owned Delaware corporation engaged in the telemedicine business, and GK Manufacturing and Packaging, Inc., a 51% owned California corporation that serves as a contract manufacturer of products containing hemp-based CBD. We also own 51% of i-Budtender and 100% of the following subsidiaries: Wild Earth Naturals, Inc. (“Wild Earth”), a Nevada corporation, Eden Holdings LLC (“Eden”), a Virginia limited liability company, Kubby Patent and Licenses, Limited Liability Company (“KPAL”), a Texas limited liability company and Hi Brands International Inc. (“Hi Brands”), a Nevada corporation. I-Budtender, Wild Earth, Eden, KPAL, and Hi Brands are currently inactive. Our business strategy is discussed below.
 
Our common stock is quoted for trading on the OTCQB Market under the symbol CBDS.
 
We currently maintain virtual principal executive offices with our staff and contractors located remotely and typically working out of their homes. Our mailing address is 450 Hillside Drive, #A224, Mesquite, Nevada 89027. Our telephone number is (702) 763-3123.
 
Business Strategy
 
In 2021, we intend to focus on continuing to grow our business in three divisions, telemedicine, contract manufacturing, and brand development and marketing of products and services to the cannabidiol (“CBD”) and marijuana industries.
Telemedicine
 
PrestoCorp (“PrestoDoctor”), offers an 
online telemedicine platform providing customer access to knowledgeable physicians to obtain a medical marijuana recommendation. PrestoDoctor uses secure video conferencing technology (https://prestodoctor.com) to provide a safe and confidential forum for the Doctor patient interview in accordance with state regulations governing issuance of medical marijuana cards. Appointments through PrestoDoctor's website generally take 10-15 minutes and can be scheduled and completed in the same day. This convenience eliminates the need for patients to travel to a clinic. More than 100,000 users have registered to consult with PrestoDoctor's 15+ licensed physicians across the United States. PrestoDoctor currently offers services in California, Nevada, New York, Missouri, and Oklahoma, and is actively targeting expansion into multiple additional states in the coming months.
 
Management is currently evaluating opportunities to expand the platform for medical marijuana evaluations into other states and is reviewing other telemedicine applications. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a catalyst for expansion 

4

of telemedicine services across the United States, and our existing systems and infrastructure are well suited to provide other similar medical evaluations. The continuing growth of wearable devices and remote monitoring capabilities are further evidence that telemedicine will continue to grow in the coming periods. Growth of the platform to take advantage of these opportunities will require capital for development of new features and capabilities necessary to provide a new service, expansion of personnel and expansion of our contracted physician pool. No assurances can be given that our efforts to expand into new areas and/or provide new services will be successful. 
 
Contract Manufacturing
 
Early in 2020, we completed the acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment and inventory to commence operations as a contract manufacturer of products containing hemp-based CBD. Our 51% owned subsidiary, GK Manufacturing and Packaging, Inc. (“GKMP”) leases a 16,000 square foot facility in Anaheim, California. GKMP recently completed its certification process as an ISO9000 manufacturer, which the Company expects will allow GKMP to attract new and higher volume customers for its contract manufacturing capabilities. GKMP is currently working with several larger customers to complete test runs that may lead to new contracts later this year.
 
Contract manufacturing is a competitive sector, particularly in the CBD and marijuana space. GKMP intends to differentiate its business model by providing significant product formulation capabilities and expertise, and by providing best in class customer service. The on-site management team has experience in developing successful proprietary products and in working with customers to produce and package customer specified products that conform exactly to the customers’ expectations. We expected stronger operating results in 2020, but our start-up of the facility coincided with the economic impact from COVID-19, and the resulting uncertainty delayed a number of orders that we anticipated would generate revenue in 2020. The delay from COVID-19 has pushed out our time table for the start-up phase and we will continue to evaluate the business as the economy begins to pick up.
 
Brand Development and Product Marketing
 
We have assembled a portfolio of brands, products, intangible assets, and expertise to allow research, development, acquisition and licensing of specialized cannabis and CBD related products, including cannabis and CBD formulas, edibles, topicals, strains, recipes and delivery systems.  We also are engaged in marketing and branding within the cannabis and CBD spaces, including our trademark pending "hi" brand and others. We hold a license for a proprietary cannabis lozenge delivery methodology, and a proprietary cannabis trauma cream formula.  We received a U.S. patent for a strain of cannabis plant named Ecuadorian Sativa (also referred to as CTS-A or CTA).  We also have U.S. patents pending on cannabis-based composition and methods of treating hypertension. In 2019, we were not able to focus on further development of these assets due to limitations on availability of capital and the need to devote our energies to growth in the telemedicine space and efforts to acquire contract manufacturing capabilities. 
 
In 2021, we plan to begin to license our intellectual property, including patents, branding and know-how to companies licensed under, and in full compliance with, state regulations applicable to cannabis businesses. Descriptions of our brand portfolio follow:
 
Wild Earth Naturals, Inc. Wild Earth Naturals, Inc. is an herbal skin care products formulation and marketing company that targets the growing natural health care products market in the United States and abroad.  We intend to develop and manufacture high-quality, herbal based skin care products providing healthier choices to consumers.  We use specialized ingredient mixing processes to produce plant glycerite/mineral herbal blends and oil extractions, which we believe will be unique to the natural health products industry.  The ingredients for our products are selected to meet a number of criteria, including, but not limited to, safety, potency, purity, stability, bio-availability, and efficacy.  We plan to control the quality of our products beginning at the formulation stage and continuing through controlled sourcing of raw ingredients, manufacturing, packaging, and labeling.
Hi Brands International Inc. On February 6, 2015, the Company formed Hi Brands International Inc., a Nevada Corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Hi Brands").  Hi Brands entered into a Purchase, Supply and Joint Venture Agreement (the "Agreement"), with Centuria Natural Foods, Inc. ("Centuria") to develop a supply of proprietary CBD (Cannabidiol) Rich Hemp Oil products, but the agreement was never implemented and no business was ever transacted. As a result, Hi Brands International, Inc. has been inactive for the last several years. Although the Hi Brands business has been inactive, the Company believes that there is value in the name and that it may afford 

5

a sound outlet for the Company’s products as we build out our product portfolio and as we bring our contract manufacturing capabilities on-line in 2021.
 
In order to capitalize on the Hi Brands concept, the Company will require capital for a virtual storefront design, online web presence, virtual shopping cart and e-payment capabilities. The concept may also be an attractive base for physical locations, which would then require capital for facilities, physical storefront and interior design, staffing, inventory, and marketing. Until a suitable capital formation plan can be developed and funded, the Hi Brands concept is likely to remain inactive.
 
Patents and Intangible Assets. The Company holds a U.S. plant patent (PP 27,475) for a strain of cannabis plant named "Ecuadorian Sativa" (also known as CTS-A and CTA). The patent is assigned to our wholly owned subsidiary, Kubby Patent and Licenses Limited Liability Company. The CTA strain has unique energizing and motivating properties rather than creating the lethargy, sleepiness and increased food consumption common from use of other cannabis plant products. The Company believes products derived from Ecuadorian Sativa may be particularly suited to members of the baby boom generation that want to experience the benefits of marijuana use without the incapacitating high common with more psychoactive strains. The aging population has shown a willingness to use marijuana to address aches and pains caused by normal aging but may be unwilling to have their faculties significantly impaired in the process. The Company is currently evaluating Ecuadorian Sativa for further development and expects the evaluation to continue in 2020. The patented strain is also licensed on a non-exclusive basis to Kush, Inc., formerly a subsidiary of the Company that was spun out as a separate entity in 2017. The Company and Kush are working together on plans for further development of products utilizing the patented strain, but it is possible that Kush could become a competitor of ours at some point in the future.
 
The Company is also pursuing additional patents and proprietary formulations on cannabis-based compositions and methods of treating hypertension and lozenge delivery systems. These proprietary products will be added to the overall product portfolio and branding platform at an appropriate future date. 
 
iBudtender. We have also been developing proprietary software, and an application (the “iBudtender App”) focused on sharing information between cannabis products, patients and businesses. iBudtender's software has been designed to help cannabis patients find cannabis products that are right for them via patient reviews, to provide nutritional information, directions, warnings and information on local availability, and to order products locally for pickup or delivery. The iBudtender business platform for dispensary owners, delivery services owners and manufacturers is designed to increase business as well as promote data sharing in an effort to help patients find the best and most effective products. The development of the iBudtender App was stopped in 2020 by limited availability of growth capital and limited resources. While we believe there is still a need for the iBudtender App, as the marijuana market has matured, competition has intensified, and the window of opportunity has narrowed. Further evaluation will take place in the second quarter of 2021 and a decision will be made then on further development of the iBudtender App.
 
Other Opportunities. In addition to licensing, branding and technology, we have the ability to offer, free of charge to patients, mainstream medical prescription discount cards, for which the Company will receive a small percentage on each prescription refill with the hi Benefits Discount Pharmacy Card. This concept has not been implemented and is likely to be a lower priority than the other opportunities mentioned above.
 
The Company continues to seek the acquisition of companies, intellectual property and other assets that fit within the company's strategic plan of assembling a portfolio of cannabis industry related businesses that have a high growth potential and are accretive to shareholder value.
 
Perceived Cannabis Industry Trends
 
We believe the cannabis industry will be characterized by the following principal trends: an increased emphasis on high quality products; an increased emphasis on scientific validation for products in the market place; more liberal regulation in regard to cannabis, even under the current administration as states' rights continue to emerge; more consolidation, take-over, and buy-out of companies in the retail, wholesale, and supply side channels; more mainstream companies entering the marketplace; and more funded research on the potential long-term health benefits of cannabis as well as its potential curative properties.

Vision
 
Our vision is to become a highly visible, diversified, international business promoting superior quality branded products and services and offering effective customer service, fair compensation, sound management and a great working environment. Over time, we plan to expand our branding, research and development, intellectual properties and licensing activities to reach markets worldwide covering telemedicine, education (through the iBudtender App or some other framework).  In order to achieve this vision, our goal is to develop and/or acquire manufacturing capabilities, intellectual property, and brands which will allow our licensees to provide innovative and effective medicinal cannabis products and cost-effective alternatives for customers seeking quality, affordable natural health products to aid in wellness and appearance.  In conducting our day-to-day operations, we will strive to:
 
·
Treat all colleagues and co-workers with respect & fairness. 
 
·
Follow a philosophy that says, "Delivering quality and customer satisfaction is our business." 
 
·
Develop and enhance the skills of our associates with the intention of providing financially rewarding business opportunities. 
 
Through a long-term commitment to this vision statement, we hope to become known as a company that is committed to its customers, associates, and communities.
 
Products
 
Online Telemedicine. Through PrestoDoctor we provide access to knowledgeable physicians for a safe and confidential way to get a medical marijuana recommendation using secure video conferencing technology. Our online telemedicine generates over 95% of our revenues. 
Contract Manufacturing Services. Through GK Manufacturing and Packaging, Inc., we are beginning to provide contract manufacturing capabilities to a wide range of customers for a wide range of products for the hemp based-CBD market sector. We did not generate significant revenues from contract manufacturing in 2020 but are evaluating steps to increase revenues and cash flows in this operating division so that this division is cash flow positive in 2021.
Consumer Products. Through December 31, 2020, the products discussed in this section are conceptual and have produced no significant revenues. We had intended to pursue the strategy described below in 2020, but the COVID-19 impacts largely shifted our strategic implementation plans to 2021. In the remainder of 2021, we expect to begin production on some of these products using our contract manufacturing arm for manufacturing when feasible. Our goal for 2021 is to solidify the branding and product marketing programs for the following products:
 
·
Proprietary Cannabis Strain. The Company owns a patented cannabis sativa plant strain known as Ecuadorian Sativa or "CTA".  The Company intends to further research the CTA strain and to ultimately monetize this intellectual property through licensing agreements in conjunction with state medical marijuana laws as well as establish business relationships with scientific research organizations to develop agricultural biologic applications based upon specific plant strain research and development methodologies. 
 
·
Lozenges and Edibles. The Company owns intellectual property (recipes and process/methods) for use in medical marijuana edibles and lozenges.  The Company's proprietary lozenge offers rapid relief, unlike other edibles of which may take up to an hour or more to take effect. Based upon preliminary results, our lozenges generally take effect within a period of five to 15 minutes.  We believe the rapid acting characteristics of our lozenges will overcome a major issue with cannabis consumption, which has been the need to inhale cannabis in order to receive a rapid response.  In addition to the lozenges, we have other forms of edibles under development. 
 
·
Recover. Recover Deep Penetrating Healing Balm is a fast-acting anti-inflammatory pain reliever for sore muscles, joints, arthritic and back pain. Organic with hemp seed oil, menthol, capsicum, and black pepper. 

7

·
Trauma Cream. Developed for blended infusion of cannabinoids and THC; Arnica is a primary ingredient for its numbing effect. 
 
·
Face Garden.  An antioxidant, moisturizing cream for the face.  The ingredients in this formula include DMAE, Vitamins Ester C, B5, Oils of Evening Primrose and Borage Seed, which are believed to firm the skin and reduce puffiness and wrinkles, while restoring the skin to a natural glow and supple appearance. Hempseed, Neem, and Jojoba Oils are added to lock in moisture. 
 
·
Body Garden.  A moisturizing body lotion designed to relieve itchy dry skin and protect against sun damage.  The ingredients in this formula include Hempseed Oil, Green Tea, and Blue Green Algae. The organic herbs, essential oils, butters, and minerals used in "Body Garden" have been formulated to provide nutrition to the skin which we believe encourages the dermis to remain healthy or return to health. 
 
·
Lip Garden.  An emollient balm containing Vitamin E and Hemp Butter that we believe can assist with healing of the lips while keeping them supple and moist. 
 
·
Clothing and Merchandise. We offer Wild Earth Naturals and "hi" branded logo men's and women's fashion tee shirts and sweatshirts from American Apparel, as well as caps and coffee mugs through the Company's www.wildearthnaturals.com website. However, as of the date of this filing the website is not operational. We expect that it will be operational again later in 2021. 
 
·
Cut Cream. Through the acquisition and initiation of operations of GK Manufacturing and Packaging, we acquired a cut cream product formulation that has proven effective at healing the effects of bare knuckle fighting, boxing and MMA fighting. We also recently retained Stitch Duran, a preeminent cut man with a world-wide reputation in the fight industry, to promote the product. 
Objectives
 
Our current strategy is to continue to promote and grow the telemedicine business under our PrestoDoctor brand, while also focusing on the start-up and ramp up of operations in our contract manufacturing business. We also intend to develop and acquire new patents when warranted, as well as developing or acquiring trade secrets, trademarks and other intellectual property that extends our reach in our targeted markets. In addition, we will seek new branding and licensing opportunities for our intellectual property, and we will seek strategic corporate and product acquisitions.
Marketing & Distribution
 
Market Conditions in the Cannabis Industry. Our target markets are located in states that have legalized the production and use of cannabis.  Eleven states plus the District of Columbia have approved measures to legalize cannabis for adult recreational use.  Thirty-three states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico have legalized the use of cannabis for medical use in some form. However, it may take multiple years for a state to establish regulations and for cannabis businesses to begin generating revenue from operations in a given state.
 
Non-Infused Products and Merchandise. We launched our www.wildearthnaturals.com website in August 2013, employing high quality graphic artists and designers. We intend to use social media, primarily Facebook, to drive traffic to our websites.  Our online stores at www.wildearthnaturals.com are not producing revenue at this time, but the website is active and ready to process sales orders once the Company rolls out the brand development and product marketing plan for our consumer products lines. 
 
During 2021, we plan to utilize direct business to business sales, internet advertising, social media market, and trade show participation to generate sales leads, orders and to entry into leading retailers and wholesalers throughout the U.S.  No assurances can be given that we will be successful in such efforts.
 
Infused Products. For cannabis infused products, we are developing our customer base through licensing agreements with third parties who are compliant with state cannabis laws in the states in which they conduct business.

8

We plan to build brand awareness by utilizing a mix of social media, trade shows, education efforts, and direct marketing to targeted businesses.
 
Geographic Presence. We plan to build brand awareness for our products in states where medical cannabis is legal, and to sell non-infused products throughout the United States.
 
Competition
 
Cannabis Industry. While we do not sell cannabis, we expect to license our intellectual property to others in the future to businesses that will sell cannabis in states where medicinal cannabis is legal.  Therefore, we look to the participants in the medical cannabis market for information on competition, as such competition will have an effect on our ability to license our branding and other intellectual property.
 
We believe the competition in the cannabis market will include numerous cannabis product companies that are highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels and product categories – with companies taking a state by state approach.  We believe that competition is principally based upon price, quality, efficacy of products, branding, marketing, customer service, and trade support.  We anticipate that large pharmaceutical companies will eventually begin to more aggressively compete in the cannabis product market. These companies and certain larger entities may have broader product lines and/or larger sales volumes than companies such as ours our those of our licensees.  Larger entities entering this market may have significantly greater financial and other resources available to them and possess extensive manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities. We anticipate that many of the larger competitors will be able to compete more effectively due to a greater extent of vertical integration. The entry of larger competitors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Skin Care. Our competition includes numerous skin care companies that are highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage, distribution channels, and product categories. In addition, large pharmaceutical companies compete with us in the skin care market.  These companies and certain large entities have broader product lines and larger sales volumes than us and have greater financial and other resources available to them and possess extensive manufacturing, distribution and marketing capabilities. Among our more prominent competitors are: Earthly Body, Burt's Bees, Melaleuca and Clarins, all of which have substantially longer track records and greater financial resources and operating efficiencies than do we. As a company with limited capital resources, we believe we will be at a competitive disadvantage until such time as we develop a broad portfolio of products that are known and accepted in the industry and we are able to demonstrate a history of financial stability. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in the market.
Technology. The competition against our information technology platform iBudtender.com and the iBudtender App, both of which we had hoped to release in 2020, include companies such as Weedmaps, Leafly, MassRoots, and Leafstrain.  Competition in the information technology market for cannabis is growing rapidly and many of our competitors have more experience and greater financial resources than do we. As a company with limited capital resources, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in a rapidly changing information technology market.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
Our products are produced using ingredients that we believe to be readily available from several sources. We purchase our raw materials from a number of different vendors. Our apparel and merchandise are procured through Printful.com. While we expect the raw materials we use to be readily available in normal times, the current COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted elements of the supply chain and we cannot determine the effect such disruptions may have on the availability of raw materials in future periods.

Intellectual Property
 
We hold certain intellectual property (the "IP") consisting of recipes and process/methods to maximize the cannabinoid concentrations to be used to make a medical marijuana ("MMJ") edible or to make a MMJ lozenge.  We also hold rights to a proprietary recipe and process/method to maximize the cannabinoid concentrations to be used to make a salve/ointment containing CBD and Arnica Montana.
 
We also hold the rights of a patent for the CTA strain of cannabis and we hold two patent applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with regard to use of the CTA strain in a lozenge and as a treatment for hypertension. We are continuing to pursue these applications; however, no assurances can be given that the remaining patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents.
 
We are also pursuing the "hi" mark in several categories filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. An objection has been filed by Tweed Corporation which wishes to use the mark on apparel. Settlement talks are ongoing.  The Company uses (or licenses) the "hi" branding for skin care products, edibles (infused and non-infused), apparel and branded merchandise.
 
We hold a Federal trademark on the name and stylized branding of "Wild Earth Naturals".  We have acquired the following registered U.S. Trademarks: Cannabis*Sativa(R), DISPENSARxY(R), and CannaRx(R). The IP identifiers are Cannabis*Sativa(R), Registration Number 4,868,622, DISPENSARxY(R), Registration Number 4,642,830 and CannaRx(R), Registration Number 4,725,687. The Marks are registered in CL 35 under Goods and Services.  No assurance can be given that such steps as the company has and will take will provide sufficient protection against potential competitors and we may be unable to successfully assert our intellectual property rights or these rights may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.  Any such invalidity, particularly with respect to our product names, or a successful intellectual property challenge or infringement proceeding against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business
 
Currently, our products consist of a telemedicine service and we are establishing contract manufacturing capabilities for products containing Hemp-based CBD. We do not, at this time cultivate, process or sell products derived from cannabis plants or products containing THC. We do hold patents and intellectual property relating to cannabis and cannabis derived products, and our business plan envisions that we may seek to begin selling cannabis or cannabis derived products at some point in the future. Accordingly, while the following discussion on governmental regulation is not directly applicable to the Company today, we may become subject to these regulations in the near future.
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") defines Schedule I controlled substances as "the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence." If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine, even though these persons are in compliance with state law.
 
In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. Any change in the federal government's enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not currently harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement policies of the federal government.

10

The Company and our licensed products will also be subject to a number of other federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.  We anticipate that our licensees and vendors will be required to manufacture our products in accordance with the Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines and will be subject to regulations relating to employee safety, working conditions, protection of the environment, and other items.  The current administration has indicated that it will closely scrutinize the cannabis industry, in particular, recreational marijuana.  Changes in laws, rules and regulations or the recall of any product by a regulatory authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
In addition to cannabis related regulations, our skincare and nutraceutical products are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.  We are required to manufacture our products in accordance with the Good Manufacturing Practices guidelines and we are also subject to regulations relating to employee safety, working conditions, protection of the environment, and other items.  Changes in such laws, rules and regulations or the recall of any product by a regulatory authority, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
Justice Department Position on Marijuana Enforcement
 
Because of the inconsistencies in federal and state law, on January 4, 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a memo on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing what it deemed to be a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous guidance documents, including the so called Cole Memorandum. Since the passage of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, Congress has generally prohibited the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana. There continues to be uncertainty respecting the enforcement of prohibitions against cultivation, distribution and possession of marijuana and the Company is monitoring the situation closely. In the event a change is announced, the Company will consider taking actions to protect its business if warranted.
 
We intend to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the enforcement priorities of the Department of Justice.
 
COVID-19
 
COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its rapid spread around the world and throughout the United States prompted many countries, including the United States, to institute restrictions on travel, public gatherings and certain business operations. These restrictions significantly disrupted economic activity in the United States and Worldwide. In retrospect, the pandemic did have a negative impact on the contract manufacturing business start-up (primarily delay) and had a positive impact on our telehealth business through loosening of regulations allowing telehealth services and an increase in persons seeking telehealth services to avoid in person visits to doctors offices. ON a combined basis, the COVID-19 disruption did not materially impact the Company’s financial statements. It now appears that the impacts from COVID are lessening and we anticipate a general improvement in the contract manufacturing space in 2021.
 
Research and Development
 
We plan to conduct research, develop products and engage in development activities with an initial focus on the following:
 
·
Consider and research telemedicine platforms and expansion opportunities that can supplement or enhance the PrestoDoctor platform and business operations; 
 
·
Identify and research Hemp derived CBD oils and related products to determine quality, availability, and efficacy in order to formulate and manufacture new CBD products; 
 
·
Identify and research new strains of cannabis and combinations of cannabis and cannabinoid nutrients that may be candidates for new products; 
 
·
Identify and research products, including intellectual property, that will benefit enhance or benefit the cannabis industry, from cultivation to consumers; 

11

·
Introduce new herbal ingredients for use in supplements; 
 
·
Study the metabolic activities of existing and newly identified ingredients; 
 
·
Enhance existing products, as new discoveries in cannabis are made; 
 
·
Formulate products to meet diverse regulatory requirements across all of its markets; 
 
·
Investigate processes for improving the production of its formulated products; and 
 
·
Investigate activities of natural extracts and formulated products in laboratory and clinical settings. 
 
It is through our internal research and development efforts and our relationships with outside research organizations and health care providers that we believe we will be able to develop high quality products. We plan for our research and development activities to include developing products that are new to the industry, updating existing formulas to keep them current with the latest science, and adapting existing formulas to meet ever-changing regulations in new and existing domestic markets.  We will select our ingredients to meet a number of criteria, including, but not limited to, safety, potency, purity, stability, bioavailability, and efficacy. We will require our licensees and vendors to control the quality of our products beginning at the formulation stage and maintain quality control through controlled sourcing of raw ingredients, manufacturing, packaging, and labeling.  Going forward, we intend to increase our spending and resources for research and development.
Environmental Laws
 
We have no known costs, and none are anticipated, from environmental laws, rules and regulations.
 
Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees
 
As of April 1, 2021, we have no employees in Cannabis Sativa, Inc. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had independent contractor arrangements with five officers and directors, and eight outside service providers. PrestoCorp has six employees, including two officers of PrestoCorp, and GK Manufacturing and Packaging, Inc. has a variable workforce, including two officers of GK.  Our employees are not represented by unions and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. The Company also has relationships with several independent contractors who provide services to the Company on a regular and on-going basis.
Facilities
 
During all of 2020, CBDS operated out of virtual offices maintained by our officers, directors and contractors. 
 
Our subsidiary PrestoDoctor leases an office in New York on a month-to-month basis for $2,444 per month. Our subsidiary GK Manufacturing and Packaging Inc. operates out of a 16,000 square foot facility in Anaheim, California. The monthly lease for the office, manufacturing and warehouse space in Anaheim is $20,000 per month plus triple net charges of $2,120 per month or $11,120 per month total. The Anaheim lease term runs from April 1, 2020, through March 31, 2021.
