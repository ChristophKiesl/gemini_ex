ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
History



We were initially organized on November 18, 2013 as a Nevada limited liability company under the name Global Energy Express LLC by the filing of articles of organization with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. On December 18, 2015, we converted from a Nevada limited liability company under the name Global Energy Express LLC to a Nevada corporation under the name All Soft Gels Inc. by the filing of articles of conversion and articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. On September 18, 2018, we changed our name from All Soft Gels Inc. to Brain Scientific Inc. and changed our ticker symbol on the OTC Pink market to “BRSF”.



On September 21, 2018, we entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with MemoryMD, Inc. and AFGG Acquisition Corp. to acquire MemoryMD, Inc. (the “Acquisition”). The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were consummated on September 21, 2018 and, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, all outstanding shares of MemoryMD were exchanged for shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we acquired 100% of Memory MD, Inc. in exchange for the issuance of shares of our common stock and MemoryMD, Inc. became our wholly-owned subsidiary. In conjunction with the Acquisition, we ceased all direct operations and assigned all of our assets and liabilities from prior to the Acquisition, and assumed and commenced the business of MemoryMD as the sole business of the Company.



On June 11, 2021, we entered into another merger agreement (the “Piezo Merger Agreement”) with Piezo Motion Corp. and BRSF Acquisition Corp. to acquire Piezo. (the “Piezo Acquisition”). The transactions contemplated by the Piezo Merger Agreement were consummated on October 1, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the Piezo Merger Agreement, all outstanding shares of Piezo were exchanged for shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we acquired 100% of Piezo in exchange for the issuance of shares of our common stock and Piezo became our wholly-owned subsidiary.



Our principal executive office is located at 6700 Professional Parkway, Lakewood Ranch, Florida 34240 and our telephone number is (917) 388-1578. Our website address is www.brainscientific.com. The information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



The Company



We are a MedTech company with two innovative product lines: neurology and motion products. Since October 1, 2021, we have had two direct subsidiaries, each of which is focused on one of our complimentary product lines.



The products of our subsidiary Memory MD, Inc., hereinafter referred to as the Neurology Products, are medical devices designed for the neurology market. The products of our subsidiary Piezo Motion Corp., hereinafter referred to as the Motion Products, are small piezoelectric motors which are designed for and expected to have valuable and beneficial uses as motors within medical devices and devices outside of the MedTech industry.



Since the merger between Brain Scientific Inc. and Piezo Motion Corp., we have focused on building an experienced team and platform to grow revenues from existing products and introduce new technologies to the market while leveraging our store of intellectual property.



The following diagram illustrates our legal structure for our two primary revenue streams.






To date, substantially all of our revenues have been derived from our Russian subsidiary, Memory MD Russia (“MMDR”), a subsidiary organized by prior management, which has operated as a distributor of third-party medical devices within Russia. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 negatively impacted the operation of MMDR. With the uncertainty raised due to the continued Russian invasion of Ukraine, and with such operations no longer part of the Company’s business plan, the Company began winding down the operations of MMDR. Accordingly, during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, MMDR satisfied its last distribution obligations and laid off all of its employees. Since then, no work has been conducted by MMDR, and the Company has no ongoing operations or employees in Russia. MMDR has no assets or liabilities and is currently a legal entity, waiting to be dissolved by Russian authorities, which we expect will occur during 2023. The Company does not currently sell, import, or export any of its products in, to or from Russia, nor does it plan to engage in such activities in the future. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issues advisories to the public on important issues related to the sanctions programs it administers, including with regards to the Ukraine/Russia related sanctions program. The Company has been monitoring the situation, and none of the customers, vendors and distributors the Company previously worked with in Russia, is currently being sanctioned by the U.S. government, nor were any of its former employees. The Company continues to maintain full compliance with all U.S. Federal laws with regards to the situation and it does not expect things to change in that regard.

Products 



The two lines of products that we currently sell are (i) Neurology Products and (ii) Motion Products.



Neurology Products



The Neurology Products of our subsidiary Memory MD, Inc. are medical devices and software products designed for the neurology market. We believe our Neurology Products represent a step forward in EEG technology and may be used in a wider range of applications beyond the traditional hospital or neurologist office.



Electroencephalography, or EEG, is a method to identify and to evaluate the electrical activity of the brain. An EEG could be beneficial, when used with other tools in the diagnosis of brain-related issues, including epilepsy, brain activity after a stroke, and sleep disorders. An EEG may also be used to determine the electrical activity of a comatose individual.



Our initial Neurology Products are intended to allow for simplifying and making more ambulatory the completion of EEG. Further, the NeuroCap™ and NeuroEEG™ Products, both 510K FDA cleared and available for sale, are focused on providing efficient tools to the EEG medical market. Our technology allows a miniature, wireless, clinical device capable of recording an EEG and provides the data to medical staff without the bulky hardware or necessitating a neurology technician to place the cap. The NeuroEEG™ amplifier and desktop software used to store and analyze data captured from the NeuroCap™ are anticipated to have strong margins, utilizing a distribution network to provide access to hospitals, neurologists, and general practitioners as well as the various telehealth and tele-neurology companies.






NeuroCap™



The NeuroCap™ is an FDA-cleared disposable, soft layered cap with an integrated electrode circuit that is designed to address existing problems of conventional EEG systems. The silver embedded wiring is pre-gelled, so it requires no prepping of the skin before application. NeuroCap™ makes it possible for medical staff of all levels to perform EEG tests, without having to laboriously apply electrodes one-by-one or spend considerable time cleaning an EEG headset after each use.





2







The NeuroCap™ works in parallel with the NeuroEEG™ amplifier device to successfully carry out EEG tests. However, the NeuroCap™ can also work with other EEG devices in addition to our NeuroEEG. The NeuroCap™’s electrode placement follows standard alignment pursuant to the international 10-20 system. The acquisition of electrical brain activity is carried out by non-invasive pre-gelled passive Ag/AgCl scalp (cutaneous) electrodes, ensuring maximum comfortability for the wearer. Benefits of NeuroCap™ include:




● | 22 electrodes and 19 active EEG channels for performing high-quality routine EEG tests; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | disposable EEG headset for reducing the risk of contagion and cross-contamination; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pre-gelled electrodes for reducing patient discomfort and concern over messy gels; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | malleable structure and adjustable Velcro straps allowing full adjustability during placement in patients with head injuries. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Expanding its potential uses, the NeuroCap™’s easy to follow numbered straps makes application easy by healthcare workers of all skill levels. We estimate preparation for the EEG can be completed in approximately 5 minutes. It is user-friendly and requires minimal training. It can be utilized for EEG testing for up to 4 hours. A routine EEG is reimbursable under several Current Procedural Terminology (CPT®) codes referring to a routine EEG.



To date, initial sales of NeuroCap™ have been made direct to a small number of hospitals and clinics. In February 2022, we entered into a manufacturing agreement which has allowed us to begin providing NeuroCap™ for broader sale in December 2022. Our strategy is to expand to indirect sales through representatives and distributors.






NeuroEEG™



The NeuroEEG™ connects wirelessly to the computer, allowing freedom of movement for the patient and enabling telemedicine applications. Currently, we believe a shortage of EEG testing equipment and technicians exists in some areas. Other technology may require a specialized technician to apply the gel and electrodes individually. A neurology technician may be more expensive and in shorter supply. They may not be staffed and available 24/7 for some hospitals.



NeuroCap™ and NeuroEEG™ can be used for recording EEGs in neurology clinics, urban and rural ED’s, ICU’s, urgent care clinics, nursing homes and assisted living facilities, sports facilities, remote clinical research studies and a variety of other settings.





3







We received our CE certification in August 2022, which will certify that our NeuroCap™ meets all sales requirements in the European Union and European-Economic Area countries.



NeuroHub™



NeuroHub™, fka NeuroNet Cloud, is being developed to collect and aggregate data from current and future Company devices like the NeuroCap™ and NeuroEEG™ and from external sources such as research and medical data banks, 3rd-party devices, and clinical-use applications. We believe that NeuroHub™ will allow for comprehensive monitoring and facilitate collaborative diagnosis, analysis, research, treatment, and prevention by employing sophisticated Artificial Intelligence or AI and machine learning or ML algorithms utilizing historical and current patient, device and platform data.



We anticipate that NeuroHub™ will allow white-labeling to provide facilities, physicians, and patients with a HIPAA-compliant branded portal for Tele-neurology/Tele-medicine services, enabling secure access to patient data for evaluation and assessment by internal and external clinical specialists and neurologists. The platform will also integrate with Electronic Medical Records or EMRs and other external medical record databases to ensure up-to-date and complete access to patient information.



We anticipate that NeuroHub™ will allow users to access patient and clinical data to evaluate patient conditions remotely. We believe that such an infrastructure removes the need for direct contact with the patient, opening up underserved geographic locations with an undersupply of physicians to meet the growing demand for neurological care as aging patient populations continue to grow.



As designed, we anticipate that NeuroHub™ will allow for cross-referencing multiple points of data to aid with the following:




● | EEG data and biomarker analysis; 
--+-------------------------------------


● | Pharmacology studies; 
--+--------------------------


● | Neurological disorders (Seizure, Sleep, Tumors, Infection/ Injury (TBI), Dementia, Stroke); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Structural Injury Classifier (SIC), Brain Function Index (BFI), and Concussion Index (CI); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Neurocognitive Assessments (Attention, behavioral, developmental); and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Neurofeedback analysis and Neurofeedback Training (NFT) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------

Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure



Our infrastructure is also being designed to gather and mine brain-imaging data. Clinicians and researchers will be able to access data profiles of their patients and generate risk assessment and treatment plans to address neurological conditions. This data could also be useful in establishing correlations between a myriad of brain scans, allowing us to further understand connections about the brain that have not been discovered.



Artificial intelligence infrastructure in the Company cloud refers to all modules used to perform automatic analysis of patient data. This infrastructure can receive inputs from many different sources such as medical databases, normative data sets, and other patient health information. By using machine-learning algorithms, the system is being designed to improve accuracy, providing for more advanced diagnostics as additional brain images are acquired.



The infrastructure is being designed to combine neural networks with state-of-the-art tree search and pattern classification systems to build robust neurological health profiles of patient brain scans. These models are expected to be self-learning, so the more data supplied to it, the more “educated” it is expected to be.



Our objective is to achieve better patient outcomes at a reduced cost through robust modelling and correlational analysis of brain imaging and other biometric data. Significant patterns recognized by the system are designed to help medical professionals detect nuances in an individual’s brain, allowing them to tailor more personalized treatment plans for their patients. NeuroHub is being designed to handle millions of brain images to create robust models that correlate health records, behaviors, and other neurological factors.



NeuroHub™ remains in development and is not currently integrated into our NeuroCap™ or NeuroEEG™.

Market Overview



We compete within the domestic and global medical device industry, referred to as the “MedTech” industry, which industry, on a global scale, is expected to reach an estimated $594.5 billion by 2024, and it is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate or CAGR of 5.3% from 2020 to 2024, according to Statista.



The MedTech industry is characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. We believe that U.S. medical device companies are highly regarded on a global scale for their innovations and high-technology products, which innovations and products are produced due to a significant investment in research and development.



Between both of our product lines, Neurology Products and Motion Products, there is a significant opportunity for growth. The primary market for our Motion Products is within MedTech. However, they can be used in multiple other businesses including drones, robotics, and automotive industries. As we continue to expand, based upon the availability of funds to do so, we anticipate pursuing these additional markets.



The global EEG system and device market is expected to reach $1.59 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 8.7% during the forecast period according to Grand View Research. We believe the increasing incidence and prevalence of neurological disorders, rising awareness about neurodegenerative disorders, high incidence of epilepsy, sleeping disorders, Parkinson’s, and the increasing applications of brain monitoring in clinical trials are driving the growth of this market. In 2018, standalone devices were estimated to generate the most revenue as they gained adoption in hospitals and specialized centers. These customers are the primary target market for our neurology devices.



The U.S. had the highest revenue share of the EEG system/device market according to Grand View Research. It is our plan to target the US market primarily, though we are pursuing sales globally through our master agent LOK Corporation as well. Statista estimates the U.S. EEG market size at $355M in 2024, growing at a 5.6% CAGR over the forecast period.



Brain monitoring is a complex process, requiring expensive and advanced devices and equipment that are mainly found only in hospitals. Hospitals also see a considerably larger inflow of patients as compared to small clinics and other end users. Additionally, brain monitoring devices can pose a considerable burden in terms of maintenance expenses on healthcare facilities; we believe that in general hospitals, more than other end users, are able to bear such costs. Hence, brain monitoring devices are mostly used in hospitals, which consequently account for the largest market share.



U.S. Healthcare Market



The National Health Expenditure Accounts or NHEA are the official estimates of total health care spending in the U.S. U.S. health care spending grew 9.7 percent in 2020, reaching $4.1 trillion or $12,530 per person. As a share of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product, health spending accounted for 19.7%.



Digital health innovations are driving growth and opportunity in three major verticals of healthcare:




● | Remote Patient Monitoring. Devices and applications that allow care providers to keep tabs on chronically ill, recently released, and overall “high-risk” patients (also referred to as remote patient management, or RPM). Wearable patches that diagnose heart conditions, sensors that monitor asthma medication intake, and glucose monitors that send diabetics’ data straight to their smartphones are just a few examples. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Telehealth. Doctor access and advise, from outside the confines of an office visit. It could be mental health counselling from across the country, diagnosis and prescription writing in pediatrics without taking a sick child to the office, alternatives to primary care physician visits, and other, similar events. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Behavior Modification. Platforms that help patients change their habits and adopt healthier lifestyles, with the primary aim of preventing illness and a clinically validated methodology of doing so. That includes smoking cessation tools and diabetes prevention through digital weight loss and coaching, among other technologies. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neurology Reimbursement



Coverage in the U.S.



Reimbursement from private third-party healthcare payors and, to a lesser extent, Medicare will be an important element of our success. Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, or CMS, and third-party payors have adopted coverage policies for our targeted indications, there is no guarantee this will continue at the same levels or at all in the future.



The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition, or ICD-10 is a clinical cataloging system that went into effect for the U.S. healthcare industry on October 1, 2015, after a series of lengthy delays. Accounting for modern advances in clinical treatment and medical devices, ICD-10 codes offer many more classification options compared to those found in its predecessor, ICD-9. Within the healthcare industry, providers, coders, IT professionals, insurance carriers, government agencies and others use ICD codes to properly note diseases on health records, to track epidemiological trends and to assist in medical reimbursement decisions.



We believe that many of the indications we are pursuing with our technologies are currently reimbursed on a widespread basis by Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance companies. 



Coverage Outside the U.S.



If we seek to commercialize our products in countries outside the U.S., coverage may be available from certain governmental authorities, private health insurance plans, and labor unions. Coverage systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. If we seek to commercialize our technology, if approved, outside the U.S., coverage approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country, region-by-region or, in some instances, a case-by case basis. Based on our ongoing evaluation, certain countries reimburse more highly than others.



Athletic Performance Market



Athletic performance encompasses the treatment and prevention of injuries related to athletics and exercise. Our business plan includes positioning our products and services as a go-to-choice in diagnostic tools for brain-related sports injuries. The EEG with cortical brain maps is highly capable of identifying post-concussion syndrome. Concussions and traumatic brain injuries caused by contact sports are a growing and significant issue among athletes. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that 1.6 million to 3.8 million concussions occur each year, and UPMC Sports Medicine estimates 5 in 10 concussions go unreported or undetected with 2 in 10 high school athletes who play contact sports getting a concussion in a given year.
Other Markets



Our business plan includes positioning our products and services as a go-to-choice in diagnostic tools for brain-related sports injuries.




● | Education Enhancement: Analysis of EEGs may be useful in recognizing cognitive differences. The brain scans of potential customers in this space can be a steppingstone for further research. The goal of selling to the education market is to have the opportunity to measure baseline EEGs of students. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clinical Trials: Clinical trials assess the safety and efficacy of a new drug, therapy, surgical procedure, medical device, or other intervention and are essential tools in conducting research. When used in clinical trials, we expect our products and services will give a fast and accurate analysis that may speed up the clinical trial process. Moreover, clinical imaging is the technique and process of capturing images of the human body for clinical purposes to reveal, diagnose or examine diseases. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Dynamics



Driver: Growing incidence of traumatic brain injuries



A traumatic brain injury or TBI is non-degenerative, non-congenital damage to the brain from an external mechanical force, possibly leading to permanent or temporary impairment. TBI is a major public health concern. According to the Journal of Neurosurgery, TBI is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with approximately 69 million people suffering TBI annually worldwide. Estimated incidence is highest in regions with good data such as North America and Europe, indicating that better testing would likely uncover a higher global TBI incidence. 



Opportunity: Increasing and expanding therapeutic applications of brain monitoring devices



Apart from applications in neurological disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders, brain monitoring devices are also used in other therapeutic areas like insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, and sleep apnea. Quantitative EEG analysis is widely used to investigate the neurophysiological characteristics of insomnia. EEG biofeedback is a training process that has been scientifically proven to aid in the management of PTSD.



A number of research studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of neurofeedback for PTSD in adults. For instance, a research study published by the NCBI, or National Center for Biotechnology Information, in 2016 demonstrated that 24 sessions of neurofeedback significantly reduced PTSD symptoms in adult sample populations. Similar studies are also being conducted in children. Such positive research outcomes suggest that neurofeedback is a promising approach in the treatment of PTSD. This is especially important because existing treatments can be quite difficult to tolerate and have limited effectiveness for many individuals with PTSD. In addition, EEG is routinely used to measure and record brain wave activity for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea. These extended applications of brain monitoring devices are expected to provide growth opportunities for players operating in this market.



Challenge: Shortage of trained professionals



Trained medical personnel are required to effectively operate devices involved in the complex process of brain monitoring. The positioning of electrodes on the scalp and the insertion of muscular needles require accuracy and can be performed only by highly trained personnel. In addition, the results generated by brain monitoring machines are complex and can only be interpreted by qualified technicians or skilled professionals. Without these fundamental skills, end users will face difficulties in maximizing the utility of their brain monitoring equipment. The presence of highly skilled medical personnel and staff is, therefore, vital for the effective use of brain monitoring equipment.



Currently, there is a shortage of skilled medical personnel in both developed and developing countries. The AAMC, or Association of American Medical Colleges, estimates that the U.S. will see a shortage of up to nearly 122,000 physicians by 2032 as demand for physicians continues to grow faster than supply, Furthermore, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, there is a projected shortage of registered nurses in the US, and it is expected to intensify by 2030. Moreover, the shortage of trained and experienced neurodiagnostic technologists globally has compelled hospitals to cross-train other allied health professionals to perform neurodiagnostic examinations. This presents a key challenge for the growth of the global brain monitoring devices market.



Market Application



For neurologists and other health providers, we aim to provide a solution for monitoring patient health and safety across a variety of locations including the hospital, specialized clinics, and home settings. In managing patients with epilepsy, providers can improve in areas concerning patient re-admittance, patient mortality and morbidity. Providers can also proactivity prevent the onset of negative chronic health conditions by engaging with at-risk populations at a fraction of the cost by implementing our affordable EEG solutions.



For health providers, our offering of an EEG monitoring solution could ease data collection efforts. By providing an accurate and consistent stream of EEG data, our products and services are being designed to allow physicians and other health professionals to make use of newly available bio-metric data to improve diagnosis, treatment, and management of various neurological illnesses, effectively increasing the quality and value add of medical services.



Our portability and integration potential augment the existing suite of remote monitoring solutions, allowing physicians to differentiate between nuanced neurological conditions happening more accurately within and outside the hospital setting. An example includes helping neurologist’s contrast nocturnal epilepsy patterns across other sleep disorders such as parasomnia where individuals engage in abnormal movements during sleep.

Motion Products



Piezo Motion is a provider of piezo motor technology with significant investment in research and development of affordable piezoelectric motors to meet, and exceed, the needs of today’s global markets. We are committed to the development of innovative piezoelectric technology and motion products that enhance their functionality in a multitude of applications. We work with startups, OEMs, research institutions and industrial companies from around the world empowering the visionaries behind their products.



Piezo Motion’s piezoelectric motors are currently divided into two main series (the Blue Series and the Imperial Series) based on design and construction methodology.



Blue Series




LCS | RBS | LAS | RAS
----+-----+-----+----

Imperial Series




PM-22R | LPM-50
-------+-------




Piezo Motion completed an extensive engineering program culminating in the development and initial launch of a unique line of small rotary and linear piezo motor products hereinafter referred to as the Blue Series, control electronics and associated software. Piezo Motion’s motor product line utilizes engineering polymers making them suitable for equipment and for high volume OEM applications. While there are several types of piezo motors on the market, the design and technology employed by Piezo Motion is new and combines what we perceive to be key advantages, such as superior precision and power density with affordability and ease-of-manufacture.



Piezo Motion’s Blue Series piezo motors are available in a variety of sizes and configurations and are divided into twelve core motor platforms which include rotary motors (Models RBS, RAS) and linear motors (Models LCS, LBS and LAS). These core motor models differ in output specification and are further divided into variants/versions which include versions having hollow-shaft and solid-shaft rotors, versions having integrated magnetic and/or optical encoders and versions which are non-magnetic and suitable for use within medical MRI. For each motor product line Piezo Motion has developed hardware control electronics together with motion control software including firmware and operating software. 



The second series of motors available is the Imperial Series which employs a unique piezoelectric drive system, in which a ring-shaped piezo resonator with a peripheral vibration shell is directly coupled to an array of radially positioned stainless-steel pushers. This unique rotary motor design enables a substantial increase in the coupling efficiency between the stator and the rotor, which increases overall motor efficiency and provides superior resolution and torque. The Imperial Series includes powerful motors capable of extremely faster response times, coupled with submicron-level angular steps and exceptional torque. The range includes both bidirectional (reversible) and unidirectional PCB-mounted piezo motor models, like the Blue Series.

We believe that the piezoelectric motors of the Blue Series are unique because they combine the key performance benefits of a piezo motor with the price point of traditional precision direct current or DC motors. The Blue Series motor utilizes engineering polymers, making them very lightweight and suitable for equipment and high-volume OEM applications. Unlike the classic DC motor (e.g., BLDC and stepper motors), the versatile design employed by the Blue Series enables rotary and linear piezo motors consisting of very few parts, enabling economical manufacturing volume yielding a stable and reliable final result. Piezo technology is inherently non-magnetic which enables motor designs for specialized applications where traditional DC motors cannot be used. Piezo motors are also immune from electromagnetic or EM and radio frequency or RF interference and generate no emissions which can aid original equipment manufacturer or OEM product compliance and reduce or eliminate shielding costs.



We also believe that the Piezo-electric motors of the Imperial Series are unique because they provide the highest level of precision performance within a robust metal enclosure. Imperial Series motors are rotary and available in both reversible and non-reversible designs. These motors offer a much higher range of torque outputs compared to the Blue Series and provide higher precision for the most demanding positioning applications. Like the Blue Series, the piezo technology employed is inherently non-magnetic which enables motor designs for specialized applications where traditional DC motors cannot be used. They are also immune from EM and RF interference and generate no emissions which can aid OEM product compliance and reduce or eliminate shielding costs.



We believe that our propriety piezo technology may be up to 1,000 times more precise and up to 100 times faster to respond than the DC competitors. A typical rotary stepper motor might be configured to make up to 200 – 500 steps in each rotation. By comparison, our Blue Series rotary motors provide over 600,000 steps per full rotation and our Imperial Series can achieve over 2.5 million steps per full rotation. These performance attributes provide smoother and more precise motion. Our technology is also extremely scalable, enabling manufacture of very compact motors with our smallest being the length and width of a thumbnail.



Piezo Motion’s target markets include industries such as:




● | Medical Technology (“MedTech”) – Medical devices, whether surgical robots, infusion MRI pumps, wearable drug dispensers, syringe pumps, or a number of other applications often require efficient, lightweight, and very precise motion. Our motors can be made to avoid electromagnetic interference, which traditional motors cannot though it is a requirement for MRI and some other MedTech applications. From precise brain incisions to being able to release a nanoliter of drug from a wearable dispenser, our motors bring the precision needed for MedTech products today and into the future. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pharmaceutical – Interlinked to the Medical Technology industry, the pharmaceutical industry relies on precise testing and measurement of substances in order to provide patients and experiments with the correct dosage. Our motors’ smooth motion and high precision have applications in pharmaceutical testing, manufacture, and patient use, especially given the rising use of wearable drug dispensing and micro dosing. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aerospace (including Drones) – Aerospace provides many applications for our small motion solutions. While our motors would not be ideal to power the blades flying a drone or aircraft, they are ideal for the small, precision movements used to control the cameras on drones (e.g., gimbals), internal movement such as valves for larger aircraft, and many other precise control and use-case related applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Industrial Automation – With industry trends towards automation and miniaturization, the need for precise movements with relation to robotic appendages, fluid control, and other fine movements will be a tailwind for our precision motion products. Increased industrial automation also implies increased use of small sensor equipment, including optical and laser sensors, for which our motor’s compact size, efficiency, and precision are ideal. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Autonomous Vehicles – Similar to industrial automation, autonomous vehicles require many small sensors, cameras, and other equipment that often requires precision motion. Our motors, which can be as small as a human thumbnail, are well-placed for such applications. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Laser and Photonics – We have active customers in the laser and photonics space, where a micro-scale linear or angular movement can create a significant change to a beam’s path. From controlling the directionality of lasers themselves to adjusting mirrors and lenses used alongside them, our motors can provide the precision and smooth motion that may be able to help this industry move forward.

Precision Motion Market



We compete within the domestic and global precision micro motor and piezoelectric motor industries which combined are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2021 to 2026 to an estimated $34.3B by 2026. The precision motion market is defined primarily by costly, high-precision piezoelectric motors and lower-end DC precision motors. These are the motors that guide lasers, satellites, Mars rovers, and small cameras, among other things. This market continues to value more compact, precise, efficient motors to address the trends of miniaturization and portability. These motors are used across many industries, including aerospace, robotics, manufacturing, drones, telecommunications, and the medical field. We believe that we are uniquely positioned with our patented technology to sell piezo precision at a price point that can compete with precision DC motors.
Medical Technology Market



The primary focus for our piezoelectric motors remains on the medical technology, or MedTech, market. Use cases for precision motion products in this space vary from lab equipment to surgical robotics to drug delivery systems, to give a few examples. The MedTech industry is an optimal target because it increasingly requires higher precision than DC motors can offer, low electromagnetic interference, and often an affordable price point to reduce system costs. We believe that our products’ unique advantages will play well into this space.
Markets and Customers



Driver: Trends toward miniaturization and portability



Creating increasingly small and mobile devices requires not just smaller and more energy-efficient motors within those devices but also more precise machinery to manufacture said devices.



According to Machine Design, the need for miniature motors is itself being expanded by trends towards the invent of collaborative robotic applications, robustness and extended life, safety and analytics through encoders and other feedback devices, and autonomy through multi-axis control. Smaller drones, smaller assembly lines, more complex smartphones and cameras, and more precise robotics all push the demand for miniaturized motors forward.



Portability has long been a trend for convenience, but an interconnected global world, increasingly complex robotic systems, and an increasingly mobile workforce all speak to the need for micro-sized motors to be more energy and weight efficient than before. According to an article from ISA (International Society of Automation), increased human-robotics interactions and systems is a primary driver behind the trend of compact portability for robotics and motion systems. These trends are likely to support market growth for our products.



Opportunity: Increased need for small precision motion systems



To drive progress in current hardware systems and robotics, and to keep pace with software and analytical developments, we believe increased motion precision is needed. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2025 humans will create 463 exabytes of data each day globally. For context, one exabyte is equal to 1 million terabytes. This predicted influx of data creation data will likely drive more precise analytics, predictions, and recommendations – but to drive change in the physical world we believe will require motion systems capable of such high precision.



Piezoelectric motors are generally more precise than DC motors, so they stand to benefit from demand for greater precision. The primary historic limitation of piezoelectric motion for precision applications has been their cost.

Challenge: The cost of piezoelectric motion systems



Piezoelectric systems can often cost 10x as much as a precision DC motor of a comparable size. For most precision use cases outside of the highest-cost, highest-precision applications, precision DC motors are used today. We believe that piezoelectric motion can be far more affordable while still maintaining advantages in precision, efficiency, simplicity, and weight compared to precision DC motors.



We believe that our patented technology makes us unique in this ability and will help us maintain pricing levels comparable to precision DC motors while offering piezoelectric motor performance.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NeuroEEG™ is compatible with our NeuroCap™ device via a cable and any computer with Bluetooth capabilities. This allows for freedom of movement of the patient while undergoing an EEG exam. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The compact size of the NeuroEEG™, roughly the size of a human palm, allows for field, ambulatory, and remote use settings more than the larger traditional EEG devices commonplace today. When paired with the NeuroCap™, it can allow for non-specialized healthcare personnel to conduct EEG exams remotely from a neurologist or hospital. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Motion Products




● | High Performance: Technology that provides up to 1000 X’s Better Resolution, up to 100 X’s Faster Reaction Time and up to 10X’s Greater Specific Power Stall Torque/Force compared to conventional DC motors (e.g., precision BLDC motors and Stepper motors. A typical commercial rotary stepper motor provides between 200-500 steps to complete a full rotation, whereas our rotary motors can provide over 600,000 steps per full rotation, making them extremely precise.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Energy & Cost Savings: Our piezo motors operate at low voltage (e.g., 5.0 VDC to 12 VDC) and have increased energy efficiency. They consume zero power in the hold position while still maintaining full torque. They are typically used in direct-drive applications where the need for a gearhead and electrical brake is eliminated altogether.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unique Properties: Our piezo motors are scalable in design (rotary and linear), can be operated silently and provide a very smooth vibration-free rotation. Their non-magnetic design eliminates problems caused by electromagnetic interference.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Non-magnetic: Our piezo motors are also available in completely non-magnetic (non-ferrous) configurations making them ideal for specialized applications where traditional DC motors cannot be used (e.g., medical MRI)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lightweight: Our piezo motors are between 50-75% less weight than comparable DC motors (e.g., BLDC & Stepper motors)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Low Cost: Modern engineered thermoplastic design enables our piezo motors to be manufactured at low cost and priced extremely competitively compared to other brands and technologies. The simplified electronic driver design lowers ownership cost further.

Intellectual Property



Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets as well as nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements, confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.



Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process. Patent protection restricts competitors from duplicating unique designs and features. To protect our proprietary secrets and competitive technologies, we have obtained and are seeking to further obtain patents, trade secrets, trademarks, and other intellectual property protection on our products whenever appropriate.



As of the date of this filing, we have obtained a total of sixteen (16) U.S. nonprovisional patents and thirteen (13) foreign patents including European, Japanese, and Chinese patents related to our NeuroCap™ and piezoelectric technologies. These patents are to protect our existing products for both neurology and piezoelectric motors. For our piezoelectric motors, we currently exploit four of our relevant US patents. The remainder may be used for future development.



We have one European patent application pending titled “Liner Piezoelectric Actuator on Rail System” (Application No. 18761639). We have also applied for one provisional U.S. patent application titled “Integrated Brain Machine Interface Platform with Graphene Based Electrodes” (Application No.: 63/070,749) in the name of Memory MD, Inc.



We also own four registered trademarks (Neuro EEG, NeuroCap, NeuroHub, Brain Scientific).



In May 2018, we entered into a Patent Assignment and License Back Agreement with Boris Goldstein, our then Chairman, Secretary and Executive Vice President, Dmitriy Prilutskiy, Stanislav Zabodaev and Medical Computer Systems Ltd. Pursuant to the agreement, among other things, Messrs. Goldstein, Prilutskiy and Zabodaev assigned all of their rights to a patent entitled “Apparatus And Method For Conducting Electroencephalography” (Application No.: 15/898,611), to us, and in return, we granted to Medical Computer Systems Ltd., an unaffiliated entity which also provides manufacturing services to us, a limited, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, nonexclusive license (without the right to sublicense or assign), to the patent, to practice, make and use the inventions, ideas and information embodied therein, and to make, use, offer to sell, sell, lease or import products, services, processes, methods and materials embodying or deriving from the inventions, ideas and information from the patent and any activities derived directly therefrom; provided, however, that if and upon FDA approval of a product, Medical Computer Systems’ aforementioned rights shall be limited to manufacturing and selling NeuroCap™ products solely to us or on our behalf provided that we purchase from Medical Computer Systems (and Medical Computer Systems makes available for sale) a minimum of 20,000 units of NeuroCap™ products per calendar year on reasonable terms and conditions to be determined by the parties in good faith; and provided further, however, that Medical Computer Systems can without any limitation sell NeuroCap™ products embodying or deriving from the inventions, ideas and information from the patent in (i) the territories that made up the former USSR (excluding the Baltic countries) and (ii) Japan. In furtherance of the foregoing first proviso, in the event we fail to purchase the annual minimum order for a particular calendar year, Medical Computer Systems’ limitation to manufacture and sell NeuroCap™ products only to us pursuant to this proviso will be suspended for the next calendar year.

Competition



All of our products face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products and services.



Many of the competitors whom we directly compete with include companies who develop or intend to develop products which have capabilities similar to ours in both the neurology and motion products markets. Similar competitive pressures on efficiency, quality and simplicity are shared by both of our product lines.



The MedTech industry is moving rapidly with wearable technology, robotic surgery, and telemedicine. In the current environment of managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among health care providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, we anticipate an increasing need to compete on the basis of price and quality. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into our current and future proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes, and successfully market these products. Some of these initiatives include, but are not limited to, creating integrated cloud solutions that connect specialists with generalists for simple data transfer and analysis, streamlining clinical diagnoses with new medical devices, and opening revenue streams from secondary healthcare markets, such as primary care medical professionals who utilize EEG analyses in their practices.



The major U.S. medical device companies who we deem as competitors include Baxter International Inc., Beckman Coulter Inc., Becton Dickinson and Company, Boston Scientific Corporation, General Electric Company’s GE Healthcare, Johnson & Johnson, St. Jude Medical, Inc., Stryker Corporation, and Medtronic plc. Many of the companies which we presently compete against or may compete against in the future have or will have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do or will. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our development.



Our motion products and services compete against a range of competitors spanning large, established manufacturers with many product lines to startups with only a few employees doing custom projects. Most of the competitors we directly compete with sell either piezoelectric motors at a higher price point than us or precision DC motors at a similar price point but with lower precision and efficiency. Our indirect competitors sell other types of small, precise motors or motion systems that may be able to fulfill some of the same use cases outside of the target focus of our products. Meanwhile our Micro Dosing Pump competes for sale to labs and researchers against microinjectors and micropumps since our product fulfills the use cases of both current product categories.



The trends of miniaturization and portability are putting pressure on manufacturers of motion systems to design smaller, more efficient, and more precise motors. In addition, the manufacturing systems and robotics used to serve these trends also need increasingly precise motors. These trends play well into the advantages of piezoelectric motors, which have traditionally come at a cost point prohibitive to many use cases outside of advanced aerospace, optics, and defense industries. When piezoelectric motors are too expensive, precision DC motors, with poorer efficiency and precision, are the general solution. Now we have invented piezoelectric motion systems that are significantly more affordable than traditional piezoelectric systems while maintaining the unique advantages of piezoelectric technology. There are a couple of other small manufacturers attempting more affordable piezoelectric motors as well but most focus on the high-end, ultra-precise applications piezoelectric motors are traditionally known for.

Sales and Marketing



We have commenced the commercial roll-out of the neurology products in 2018 and the Blue Series in 2020. For our neurology products we are initial targeting the U.S. market. For our motion products, we intend to market on a global basis with business representatives in the U.S., Europe, and Asia.



Our marketing organization operates as a shared service across both product lines. Marketing focuses on digital platforms, support of marketing partners and participation in trade shows. We are identifying additional long-term partners to accelerate market penetration, product diversification, and ultimate survivability across targeted verticals. Through new implementations of our products and services, we expect to retain and capture additional market share through continuous enhancements. Our neurology products are sold initially through distribution partners or directly to hospitals and neurology clinics. Our motion products sales strategy focuses on OEM product manufactures where size, precision and scale are key characteristics of their product needs. We provide resources online that allow OEM’s to learn and incorporate our motor into their product designs. We offer evaluation kits direct from our website and through our partner network.



We plan to utilize partner relationships and co-marketing opportunities as the initial driver of our marketing efforts, thereby benefiting from increased speed-to-market, as well as the ability to leverage a pre-existing audience/customer base and communications channels. We expect to offer to early adopters our products and services at preferential rates in exchange for expediting development, distribution, and sales of such products and services.



Our linear and rotary motion products are commercially available directly from Piezo or from one of our worldwide distribution partners. We market our solution through an integrated digital marketing program and in-person trade shows and conferences. Our partners market our products directly to their customers in their local markets.



Since 2019 and until the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, we have acted as a distributor of third-party medical devices in Russia. With the uncertainty raised due to the continued Russian invasion of Ukraine, and with such operations no longer part of the Company’s business plan, the Company began winding down the operations of MMDR. MMDR completed all distribution agreements and terminated all employees in May 2022.



Manufacturing, Supply and Quality Assurance



Our manufacturing is a combination of outsourced and in-house for our two product lines.



We currently outsource the supply and manufacture of all components of our neurology products. For our neurology products, we plan to continue with an outsourced manufacturing arrangement for the foreseeable future. We expect that our third-party manufacturers will be competent to manufacture our products and have quality systems established that meet FDA requirements. We believe that the manufacturer which we currently utilize or those manufacturers that we may utilize in the future have or will have sufficient capacity to meet our launch requirements when and if our technology under development is approved and are or will be able to scale up their capacity relatively quickly with minimal capital investment. We have also identified capable second source manufacturers and suppliers in the event of disruption from any of our primary vendors.



Our piezoelectric motors are currently fully assembled and tested in-house. The material components used in the assembly process include plastics, piezoceramics and metals. The main housing for our motors is produced from engineered thermoplastic. We currently use two plastics companies to produce these injection molded parts. One of these companies is located locally in Florida, the other company is located overseas. Our assembly area consists of a localized storeroom, a site for fabrication, subassembly manufacturing, final assembly, and test/quality verification. We continue to look to enhance our processes by focusing on automation and lean initiatives.



Our piezoelectric motor materials from suppliers are routinely inspected for quality and conformance against documented specifications. We are in the process of securing certification for ISO 9001 quality management systems. Our piezoceramics are currently sourced from two suppliers, one is located in the US, the other is overseas. The vast majority of all other components, including electronic components used in the assembly of our motors and associated electronics, are available off-the-shelf from various suppliers sourced within the U.S.





15







We believe that the suppliers we currently utilize or that we may utilize in the future have or will have sufficient capacity to meet our launch requirements and are or will be able to scale up their capacity relatively quickly as demand for our product grows. We believe that with increased future demand, our per unit costs will decrease materially. Our suppliers meet the quality management systems for ISO 13485 or 9001 as required by the product. As a medical device developer, the facilities of our sterilization and other critical suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. We plan to audit our suppliers periodically to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies, and procedures for our devices. We have also identified capable second source suppliers in the event of disruption from any of our primary vendors.



Research and Developments



Our research and development programs are performed in the U. S., Ukraine and internationally. Our research and development is generally pursued by engineers and scientists employed by us on a full-time basis or hired as per diem consultants or through partnerships with industry leaders in manufacturing, design, research, and academia. We are also working with subcontractors in developing specific components of our technologies. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, our personnel in Ukraine have been able to work from the office. They are currently working in the office and remotely; however, may not be able to return consistently to an office location during the foreseeable future.



The primary objective of our research and development program is to advance the development of our existing and future products and technologies. This work includes studies focused on topics such as:




● | Solid-state physics of piezoelectric materials;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | Materials Research;
--+--------------------


● | Electromechanical properties of piezoceramic materials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------

Government Regulation



Our operations are subject to comprehensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we or our manufacturing and research and development partners do business. The laws and regulations governing our business and interpretations of those laws and regulations are subject to frequent change. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our manufacturing and research and development partners and affiliates, to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The laws and regulations relating to medical products that apply to our business and that of our partners and affiliates continue to evolve, and we must, therefore, devote significant resources to monitoring developments in legislation, enforcement, and regulation in such areas. As the applicable laws and regulations change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. We cannot provide assurance that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations.

U.S. Healthcare Regulation



Our NeuroEEG™ and NeuroCap™ are each a medical device subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Centers for Medicare& Medicaid Services, or CMS, the European Commission, and regulatory bodies in other countries. Regulations cover virtually every critical aspect of a medical device company’s business operations, including research activities, product development, quality and risk management, contracting, reimbursement, medical communications, and sales and marketing. In the U.S., the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the implementing regulations of the FDA govern product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, product manufacturing, quality systems, import and export, product labeling, product storage, recalls and field safety corrective actions, advertising and promotion, product sales and distribution, and post-market clinical surveillance. Our business is subject to federal, state, local, and foreign regulations, such as ISO 13485, ISO 14971, FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, contained in 21 CFR Part 820, and the European Commission’s Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices and its amendments.



The FDA characterizes medical devices into one of three classes. Devices that are considered by the FDA to pose lower risk are classified as Class I or II. Class I devices and are subject to controls for labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to the FDA’s QSR. This pertains to manufacturers’ methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, and shipping of products, but are usually exempt from premarket notification requirements. Class II devices are subject to the same general controls but may be subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling, and may also require clinical testing prior to clearance or approval. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, including devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury.



Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the pre-market notification requirement under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, and the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. However, a pre-market approval, or PMA application, is required for devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices, or those that are “not substantially equivalent” either to a device previously cleared through the 510(k) process or to a “preamendment” Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 when PMA applications were not required. The PMA approval process is more comprehensive than the 510(k) clearance process and typically takes several years to complete. While the 510(k) process is typically shorter than a PMA process, both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be expensive and lengthy.



Our current devices NeuroCap™ and NeuroEEG™ devices are classified as Class II medical devices by the U.S.FDA.



FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:




● | the device may not be safe, effective, reliable or accurate to the FDA’s satisfaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If an FDA evaluation of a PMA application is favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter, or approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of a device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted, and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.





17







New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.



Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), to the FDA. An IDE allows the investigational device to be used in a clinical study in order to collect safety and effectiveness data. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. The FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. Clinical trials must be entered into the clinical trials registry at clintrials.gov.



The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:




● | the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | patients, sponsors, or study sites do not comply with trial protocols;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | patient follow-up is not at the rate expected;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | patients experience adverse side effects;
--+------------------------------------------


● | patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of our trial;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices, or other FDA requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the sponsor or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to the sponsor or the study that the FDA deems to make the study results unreliable, or the company or investigators fail to disclose such interests;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA concludes that our trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and Similar Foreign and State Laws and Regulations Affecting the Transmission, Security and Privacy of Health Information



We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as service providers of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from HIPAA and each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.



Foreign data privacy regulations, such as the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC), the country-specific regulations that implement Directive 95/46/EC, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also govern the processing of personally identifiable data and may be stricter than U.S. laws.



Post-Marketing Restrictions and Enforcement



After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:




● | submitting and updating establishment registration and device listings with the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, record maintenance, including maintenance of complaint and related investigation files, and other quality assurance controls during the manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | unannounced routine or for-cause device facility inspections by the FDA, which may include our suppliers’ and manufacturer’s facilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved (or “off-label”) uses and impose other restrictions relating to promotional activities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In addition, under the FDA medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device of such manufacturer were to recur. The decision to file an MDR involves a judgment by the manufacturer. If the FDA disagrees with the manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can take enforcement action.



The MDR requirements also extend to health care facilities that use medical devices in providing care to patients, or “device user facilities,” which include hospitals, ambulatory surgical facilities, nursing homes, outpatient diagnostic facilities, or outpatient treatment facilities, but not physician offices. A device user facility must report any device-related death to both the FDA and the device manufacturer, or any device-related serious injury to the manufacturer (or, if the manufacturer is unknown, to the FDA) within 10 days of the event. Device user facilities are not required to report device malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur but may voluntarily report such malfunctions through MedWatch, the FDA’s Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program.





19







The FDA also has the authority to require the recall of commercialized medical device products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. The authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any distributed devices fail to meet established specifications, are otherwise misbranded or adulterated under the FDCA, or if any other material deficiency is found. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within ten working days after the recall is initiated.



The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:




● | warning letters, fines, injunctions or civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | recalls, detentions or seizures of products;
--+---------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions;
--+------------------------


● | delays in the introduction of products into the market;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | total or partial suspension of production;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | delay or refusal of the FDA or other regulators to grant 510(k) clearance, PMA approvals, or other marketing authorization to new products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | withdrawals of marketing authorizations; or
--+--------------------------------------------


● | in the most serious cases, criminal prosecution.
--+-------------------------------------------------




To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors.



Federal Trade Commission Regulatory Oversight



Our advertising for our products and services is subject to federal truth-in-advertising laws enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, as well as comparable state consumer protection laws. Under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act, the FTC is empowered, among other things, to (a) prevent unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce; (b) seek monetary redress and other relief for conduct injurious to consumers; and (c) gather and compile information and conduct investigations relating to the organization, business, practices, and management of entities engaged in commerce. The FTC has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by the substantive requirements of the FTC Act and other consumer protection laws can result in administrative or judicial penalties, including civil penalties, injunctions affecting the manner in which we would be able to market services or products in the future, or criminal prosecution.
International Healthcare Regulation



International sales of medical devices are subject to local government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, U.S., Canada and various other industrialized countries.





20







The primary regulatory body in Europe is that of the European Union, the European Commission, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of these relevant directives will be entitled to bear the Conformité Européenne (CE) conformity marking (as the logo ), indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed anywhere in the European Union and European Economic Area (EEA).



The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body.” This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. Additional local requirements may apply on a country-by-country basis. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval would need to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our Products.



Medical devices in Europe are classified into four primary categories. They are as follows:




● | Non-invasive devices;
--+----------------------


● | Invasive medical devices;
--+--------------------------


● | Active medical devices; and
--+----------------------------


● | Special Rules (including contraceptive, disinfectant, and radiological diagnostic medical devices)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Devices are further segmented into the classes noted below. In Vitro Diagnostic devices (IVDs) have their own classification scheme and while active implantable devices do not follow the same classification system as provided by the Medical Device Directive (MDD), they are subject to similar requirements as Class III devices:




● | Class I – Provided non-sterile or do not have a measuring function (low risk)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class I – Provided sterile and/or have a measuring function (low/medium risk)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class IIa (medium risk)
--+------------------------


● | Class IIb (medium/high risk)
--+-----------------------------


● | Class III (high risk)
--+----------------------




We have a wholly-owned subsidiary in Europe (Poland) for current product distribution.



Other Regulatory Requirements



Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:




● | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, risk management, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations that prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising, and promotion;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






21








● | Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and could be a risk to health; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post-market surveillance studies or establish and maintain a system for tracking our Products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA enforces regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors.



Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. These may include any of the following sanctions or consequences:




● | warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------


● | unanticipated expenditures;
--+----------------------------


● | delays in approving or refusal to approve future products; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries;


● | suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearance or approval;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | product recall or seizure;
--+---------------------------


● | interruption of production;
--+----------------------------


● | operating restrictions;
--+------------------------


● | injunctions; and
--+-----------------


● | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------




Our contract manufacturers, specification developers and some suppliers of components or device accessories, also are required to manufacture our Neurology Products in compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down such manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.

Fraud and Abuse Laws



In addition to FDA restrictions, there are numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Our relationships with healthcare providers and other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.



Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws



The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a review of all its relevant facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of (or purchases, or recommendations related to) federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been implicated and potentially violated.



The penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which do not have the same exceptions and apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA. Specifically, as noted above, under the Anti-Kickback Statute, the government must prove the defendant acted “knowingly” to prove a violation occurred. The PPACA added a provision to clarify that with respect to violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute, “a person need not have actual knowledge” of the statute or specific intent to commit a violation of the statute. This change effectively overturns case law interpretations that set a higher standard under which prosecutors had to prove the specific intent to violate the law. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 



We plan to provide the initial training to providers and patients necessary for appropriate use of our technology either through our own educators or by contracting with outside educators that have completed an appropriate training course. Outside educators are reimbursed for their services at fair market value.



Noncompliance with the federal anti-kickback legislation could result in our exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and civil and criminal penalties.



Federal law also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law,” which prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services,” including a company that furnishes durable medical equipment, in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. We believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements.





23







Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.



Additionally, as some of these laws are still evolving, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider and training arrangements may ultimately be found to be not in compliance with applicable federal law.



Federal False Claims Act



The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against companies under the Federal False Claims Act. Penalties include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.



There are other federal anti-fraud laws that that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.



Additionally, HIPAA established two federal crimes in the healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.



Civil Monetary Penalties Law



In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute and the civil and criminal False Claims Acts, the federal government has the authority to seek civil monetary penalties, or CMPs, assessments, and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a wide variety of prohibited conduct. For example, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the imposition of substantial CMPs against an entity that engages in activities including, but not limited to: (1) knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or which is otherwise false or fraudulent in any way; (2) knowingly giving or causing to be given false or misleading information reasonably expected to influence the decision to discharge a patient; (3) offering or giving remuneration to any beneficiary of a federal health care program likely to influence the receipt of reimbursable items or services; (4) arranging for reimbursable services with an entity which is excluded from participation from a federal health care program; (5) knowingly or willfully soliciting or receiving remuneration for a referral of a federal health care program beneficiary; or (6) using a payment intended for a federal health care program beneficiary for another use. Noncompliance can result in civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.





24







State Fraud and Abuse Provisions



Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and a false claims act. We believe that we are in conformance to such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Physician Payment Sunshine Act



Transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers and teaching hospitals may also impact our business practices. The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires most medical device manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of Human Health Services financial arrangements, payments, or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. The payment information is made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Over the next several years, we will need to dedicate significant resources to establish and maintain systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties. Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration in foreign jurisdictions.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act



The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making corrupt payments, gifts or transfers to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the U.S., can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.

25
--







The debentures contain mandatory and voluntary conversion features as follows:



(a) Mandatory Conversion.



In the event a Qualified Offering is consummated prior to June 10, 2023, the debentures automatically convert into shares of Common Stock, immediately upon the occurrence of a Qualified Offering. The exercise price per share of Common Stock pursuant to the warrant shall mean, in the case of a mandatory conversion, the price of the Common Stock (or unit, if units are offered in the Qualified Offering) in the Qualified Offering.
(b) Voluntary Conversion.



The Holders of the debentures have the right (subject to the conversion limitations set forth therein) from time following the maturity date and prior to a mandatory conversion to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal and interest then due under the debentures into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock. The exercise price per share of Common Stock pursuant to the warrant shall mean, in the case of a voluntary conversion, the lower of (i) $0.25 per share or (ii) 75% of the average of the VWAP of the Company’s Common Stock during the ten (10) Trading Day period immediately prior to the maturity date.



In connection with the March 2023 PPO, on the Effective Date, the Company and the Holders entered into a letter agreement (the “March 2023 Letter Agreement”) whereby the company agreed, in order to induce the Holders to participate in the March 2023 PPO, to (i) modify that certain security agreement, dated June 10, 2022 (the “Security Agreement”) entered into by and among the Company, the Company’s subsidiaries and the investors in the Company’s June 2022 private placement offering (the “June 2022 PPO Offering”) to provide that the indebtedness reflected by the debentures and the Company’s obligations with respect thereto are included under the Security Agreement and covered by the security interest granted thereby; and (ii) provide the opportunity for all other participants in the June 2022 PPO Offering to participate in the March 2023 PPO.



Pursuant to the Security Agreement, the Company agreed to grant each of the Holders a security interest in all of the assets of the Company, to secure the prompt payment, performance and discharge in full of all of the Company’s obligations under the debentures.



On March 31, 2023, the Company consummated the second closing of the March 2023 PPO whereby the Company sold to the Holders, for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000, (i) 50% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debentures in the principal amount of $200,000; and (ii) 59,988 warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock.

On June 16, 2022, the Company received a written consent in lieu of a meeting by the Majority Stockholders authorizing the Increase in Authorized Shares. The Increase in Authorized Shares shall become effective upon the filing of a certificate of amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. We filed the certificate of amendment on August 12, 2022.





26







Adoption of the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan



On May 21, 2022, the Board approved, authorized, and adopted the Brain Scientific 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”) and certain forms of ancillary agreements to be used in connection with the issuance of stock and/or options pursuant to the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 12,500,000 shares of Common Stock through the grant of non-qualified options (the “Non-qualified Options”), incentive options (the “Incentive Options” and together with the Non-qualified Options, the “Options”) and restricted stock (the “Restricted Stock”) restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and other equity-based awards to directors, officers, consultants, attorneys, advisors and employees.



On June 16, 2022, the Company received a written consent in lieu of a meeting by the Majority Stockholders approving the adoption of the 2022 Plan.



PPO Debenture/Warrant Offering



On June 13, 2022, the Company entered into that certain securities purchase agreement (the “PPO SPA”) with thirteen accredited investors (the “PPO Holders”) pursuant to which the Company and the PPO Holders consummated a private placement offering (the “June 2022 PPO Offering”) whereby the PPO Holders purchased from the Company, for an aggregate purchase price of $5,110,000 (the “Purchase Price”) (i) 10% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $5,659,500 (the “PPO Debentures”); and (ii) warrants (the “PPO Warrants”) to purchase 222,311 shares of Common Stock.



The PPO Debentures are due, subject to the terms therein, 12 months from their date of issuance unless extended pursuant to the terms thereunder (the “Maturity Date”). The PPO Debentures contain mandatory and voluntary conversion features as follows:



In the event a Qualified Offering (as defined below) is consummated prior to the Maturity Date of the PPO Debentures, the PPO Debentures automatically convert into shares of Common Stock, immediately upon the occurrence of such offering (the “Mandatory Conversion”). The conversion price per share of Common Stock pursuant to the PPO Debentures means, in the case of a Mandatory Conversion, the lesser of (i) $21.25 per share and (ii) 70% of the offering price of the securities in a Qualified Offering. In addition, the PPO Holders shall have the opportunity to force redemption of up to 45% of principal amount, together with accrued interest (but excluding OID) in connection with a Qualified Offering (the “PPO Redemption”). For these purposes, a registered offering of our securities for aggregate gross proceeds to us of at least $5,000,000, resulting in the listing for trading of the Common Stock on the NYSE American or The Nasdaq Capital Market shall be deemed a “Qualified Offering” . See “Letter Agreements with the PPO Holders” above for agreements reached with the holders of PPO Debentures with respect to the PPO Redemption provisions.



The holders of the PPO Debentures have the right from time to following the Maturity Date and prior to a Mandatory Conversion to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal and interest then due under the PPO Debentures into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (the “Voluntary Conversion”). The conversion price per share of Common Stock pursuant to the PPO Debentures means, in the case of a Voluntary Conversion, the lower of (i) $21.25 per share or (ii) 75% of the average of the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of the Common Stock during the ten-trading day period immediately prior to the applicable conversion date.



The PPO Warrants are exercisable for a period of five years and six months commencing upon the earlier of (i) the Maturity Date or (ii) the closing of a Qualified Offering. The exercise price of the PPO Warrants is (i) the Qualified Offering price per share, or (ii) if no Qualified Offering has occurred prior to the Maturity Date then the lower of (i) $21.25 per share or (ii) 75% of the average of the VWAP of the Company’s Common Stock during the ten (10) Trading Day period immediately prior to the Maturity Date (on an as adjusted basis giving effect to any splits, dividend and the like during such ten (10) Trading Day period). See “Letter Agreements with the PPO Holders” above for agreements reached with the holders of PPO Warrants with respect to changes to the exercise price of the PPO Warrants.





27







The PPO Warrants contain a cashless exercise provision if at any time after 180 days following the closing of the Qualified Offering there is no effective registration statement registering, or no current prospectus available for, the resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder. The Company has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the filing of a registration statement with the SEC covering the resale of the shares issuable upon conversion of the PPO Debentures and exercise of the PPO Warrants at the same time as the Qualified Offering and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective at the time of the Qualified Offering. The Company shall cause any registration statement filed pursuant to this section to remain effective for a period of at least twelve (12) consecutive months after the date that the registration becomes effective.



In connection with the June 2022 PPO Offering, our subsidiaries Piezo Motion Corp., and Memory MD, Inc., executed guarantees in favor of the PPO Holders, under which they have jointly and severally, unconditionally, and irrevocably, guaranteed to the PPO Holders the prompt and complete payment and performance when due of our obligations pursuant to the securities purchase agreements executed in connection with the June 2022 PPO Offering.



In connection with the June 2022 PPO Offering, we also entered into that certain Security Agreement by and among us, each of the PPO Holders, Piezo Motion Corp., and Memory MD, Inc., whereby we granted each of the PPO Holders a security interest in all of our assets to secure the prompt payment, performance and discharge in full of all of the our obligations under the PPO Debentures and the obligations of Piezo Motion Corp., and Memory MD, Inc., under the Guarantee.



Additionally, in connection with the June 2022 PPO Offering, holders of certain of our convertible notes (the “Prior Convertible Notes”) converted the Prior Convertible Notes (including principal and interest) into an aggregate of 641,606 shares of Common Stock based on a conversion price of $21.25 per share. To incentivize such noteholders to convert, we increased the principal amount of the Prior Convertible Notes by $1,175,741 resulting in the approximate aggregate principal amount of $12,933,155 being converted into equity, plus interest of $700,988. In connection with their original investment, these holders were entitled to warrants (the “Original Warrants”) based on 50% coverage of their original investment amount. On November 15, 2022, the Company issued a total 276,648 of Original Warrants to such holders. The Original Warrants are for a term of four years with an exercise price of $21.25 per share. The holders of the Prior Convertible Notes and Original Warrants also agreed to waive and forgo the rights to the registration of the securities underlying the Prior Convertible Notes and Original Warrants. See also “Letter Agreements with Holders of Prior Convertible Notes” above.



Russian Invasion of Ukraine



On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. Our Piezo research and development group in Kyiv has not been able to consistently work from the offices since that time. The team from Kyiv work from the office and remotely. We do not know when they will have consistent access to the office. Further, we have engineering resources capable of performing the work done in Kyiv from the United States.



In 2019 and until the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, MMDR acted as a distributor of third-party medical devices in Russia, which resulted in substantially all of our revenue for 2020 and 2021. The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 negatively impacted the operation of MMDR. With the uncertainty raised due to the continued Russian invasion of Ukraine, and with such operations no longer part of the Company’s business plan, the Company began winding down the operations of MMDR. Accordingly, during the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, MMDR satisfied its last distribution obligations and laid off all of its employees. Since then, no work has been conducted by MMDR, and the Company has no ongoing operations or employees in Russia. MMDR has no assets or liabilities and is currently a legal entity, waiting to be dissolved by Russian authorities, which we expect will occur during 2023. The Company does not currently sell, import, or export any of its products in, to or from Russia, nor does it plan to engage in such activities in the future. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issues advisories to the public on important issues related to the sanctions programs it administers, including with regards to the Ukraine/Russia related sanctions program. The Company has been monitoring the situation, and none of the customers, vendors and distributors the Company previously worked with in Russia, is currently being sanctioned by the U.S. government, nor were any of its former employees. The Company continues to maintain full compliance with all U.S. Federal laws with regards to the situation and it does not expect things to change in that regard.
