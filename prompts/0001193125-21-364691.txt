ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General 
 We are a Delaware corporation structured as a blank check company formed on August 24, 2020, for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. 
 We seek to leverage our management team’s proprietary global network of strong relationships with private equity sponsors, entrepreneurs, venture and growth capital funds, family offices, large corporations, sovereign wealth funds and their owners and most senior officers to identify, structure, finance, acquire and support the operation of a business combination target. In pursuing our strategy we intend to take advantage of our management team’s extensive experience in investing in and operating businesses across a wide range of sectors and geographies. 
 While we may pursue an initial business combination with any target business and in any sector or geographical location, we have initially focused our search on companies operating in the TMT and fintech sectors that are headquartered in Europe, Israel, the Middle East or North America. 
 We believe that this combination of relationships, experience and expertise puts us in a strong position to source an attractive target and complete an initial business combination and makes us a preferred partner for potential business combination targets. 
 In September 2020, we issued 7,187,500 founder shares to our sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. In November 2020, our sponsor transferred to our independent directors an aggregate of 150,000 founder shares at the same price originally paid for such shares. In December 2020, we effected a stock dividend of 1,437,500 shares with respect to our Class B common stock, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 8,625,000 founder shares. 
 The registration statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-251058 and 333-251448) for our initial public offering were declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 17, 2020. On December 22, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering of 34,500,000 units, including the issuance of 4,500,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ full exercise of their over-allotment option, with each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The units in our initial public offering were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $345,000,000. 
 Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering and the full over-allotment option, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 8,900,000 private placement warrants to our sponsor at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $8,900,000 (the “private placement”). 
 A total of $345,000,000 (or $10.00 per unit sold in our initial public offering) of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement was placed in the trust account, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and has been invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination within the required time period and (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below, except that interest earned on the trust account can be released to pay our taxes payable and for dissolution expenses up to $100,000, as applicable.

   Transaction costs amounted to $19,455,706, consisting of $6,900,000 of underwriting fees, $12,075,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $480,706 of other offering costs. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had cash of $990,870 outside of the trust account and cash and marketable securities held in the trust account of $345,009,370. 
 Our units began trading on December 18, 2020 on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “GFX.U.” Commencing on February 8, 2021, the shares of Class A common stock and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on the NYSE under the symbols “GFX” and “GFX WS,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “GFX.U.” 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that can benefit from: (i) the global capital markets and operating experience of our management team and strategic advisory group, (ii) additional capital to achieve its growth strategy and (iii) access to public securities markets. 
 Our management team has access to a wide range of companies operating in TMT and fintech sectors that are headquartered in Europe, Israel, the Middle East or North America. 
 Our executive officers’ combined experience includes over 100 years of investment banking, private equity and executive management experience and over 440 transactions with an aggregate value of over $550 billion globally. Our management team’s network has been developed through its: 
 

• | experience in sourcing, structuring, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | relationships with business owners, financing providers and target management teams; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extensive experience in both investing in and operating businesses across a wide range of sectors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our management team leverages these capabilities, networks and expertise together with those of our strategic advisory group. 
 We have chosen our independent board members and established a strategic advisory group for the purposes of assisting our executive officers with sourcing and evaluating business combination opportunities and developing plans and strategies to optimize any business that we acquire. 
 Our independent board members have extensive sector and geographic expertise, operating experience, access to proprietary deal flow, strong relationships with business leaders and entrepreneurs and the ability to source an attractive target and assist us in implementing our business combination strategy. They have held senior leadership positions with companies where they have a proven strong track record of creating shareholder value, organically and through transformational acquisitions or corporate restructurings, as well as extensive relationships with owners and operators of companies within their respective industries. 
 Our strategic advisory group consists of individuals who have complementary sourcing and operational expertise in our sectors of focus. Specifically, they have experience in: 
 

• | operating companies, devising and implementing strategies and identifying, monitoring and recruiting world-class talent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing and growing companies organically by expanding their product range and geographic footprint;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | acquiring companies, leading transformational transactions or corporate restructurings and managing corporate integration with success;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



5 

   
• | investing in equity and fixed income assets in both public and private markets across various sectors, jurisdictions and economic cycles; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing and maintaining extensive relationships with owners and operators of companies, as well as with a wide range of financial and legal advisers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our strategic advisory group currently includes: 
 

• | Francois Barrault, Chairman & Founder, FDB Partners; formerly CEO, BT Global Services; President, BT International; President & CEO, Lucent EMEA; CEO, Lucent Mobile International; Founder, DigiWorld Summit;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Joseph Berardino, Managing Director, Alvarez & Marsal; formerly Partner, Arthur Andersen; CEO, Andersen

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We may add additional members to the strategic advisory group from time to time. Unlike our management team, members of our strategic advisory group are not responsible for managing our day-to-day affairs and have no authority to engage in substantive discussions with business combination targets on our behalf. Members of our strategic advisory group are not paid, but may be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them, in connection with the search for business combination targets before or after the consummation of our initial business combination. We have not currently entered into any formal arrangements or agreements with the members of our strategic advisory group to provide services to us and they have no fiduciary obligations to present business opportunities to us. 
 To align the incentives of members of the strategic advisory group with our stockholders, a majority of the members of the strategic advisory group have invested in our sponsor and are eligible to share in a portion of the appreciation in founder shares and private placement warrants, provided that we successfully complete a business combination. 
 We believe that the combination of our management team and strategic advisory group is an innovative approach to identifying potential high quality business combination targets and aligns incentives with our stockholders, providing us with distinctive and differentiated capabilities to create stockholder value. 
 
6 

   We also have access to the advisory and other resources and strategic capabilities of Full Circle Capital, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in our acquisition strategy and our ability to identify and implement value creation initiatives. Full Circle Capital was founded by Makram Azar in 2019 as a private investment and advisory group that provides financial and strategic advice to key partners and select clients within its network, leveraging its global reach and experience across a broad range of sectors and geographies, to source direct principal investment opportunities across the spectrum of private equity, including venture and buy-outs, in the UK, continental Europe, North America and the Middle East, with an emphasis on cross-sector tech, media, telecom, consumer and impact and sustainability. 
 In addition, target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. 
 We have strong relationships on both sides of the Atlantic and believe that the networks and experience of our management team and strategic advisory group provide us with specific competitive advantages over other blank check companies in sourcing attractive targets based in Europe, Israel or the Middle East. We believe that these regions provide a compelling market opportunity for the following reasons: 
 

• | Attractive valuation: stocks in these markets tend to trade at lower valuations, enhancing the multiple arbitrage available by listing the target in the U.S.;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Underpenetrated: equity markets in Europe, Israel and the Middle East are comparatively more thinly capitalized relative to the U.S. in terms of GDP, suggesting a large number of high-quality private companies that could benefit from going public; furthermore, there have been comparatively few business combinations between U.S.-listed blank check companies and targets located in Europe, Israel and the Middle East – just 18, compared to 110 with U.S. targets, from January 1, 2019 to November 30, 2020;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Underrepresented: Europe is second only to China as an exporter of goods and services to the U.S., reflecting substantial economic output and a nexus to the U.S., whereas relatively few European companies have completed initial public offerings in the U.S.;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our knowledge and experience: our executive officers, board of directors and strategic advisory group have substantial experience in, and relationships with, the most senior decision makers across these regions, which we believe gives us substantially greater access to opportunities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Access to family or founder owned businesses: we have strong ties with prominent families (particularly, but not exclusively, based in Europe, Israel and the Middle East) and have a history of working constructively and collaboratively with family and founder-owned businesses, which is a point of differentiation in negotiating a business combination with these companies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technology and innovation: these regions have emerged as technology hubs in their own right, outside of Silicon Valley; for instance, at the time of our initial public offering, there were over 60 “unicorns” – private companies valued at $1 billion or more – based in Europe, Israel and the Middle East;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | US stock exchanges’ increasing attractiveness: at the time of our initial public offering, over 200 companies from Europe, Israel and the Middle East had their primary listings on NYSE or Nasdaq, compared to fewer than 20 in 2010; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Limited competition: our on-the-ground presence in Europe as well as well as our knowledge of, relationships in, and experience investing in, Europe, Israel and the Middle East are key differentiators for us as compared to other blank check companies, the vast majority of which we believe are seeking business combinations exclusively in the U.S.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Combination Criteria 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We have used these criteria and guidelines 
 
7 

   in evaluating business combination opportunities, although we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 
 We view ourselves as rigorous, disciplined and valuation-centric investors, with a keen understanding of market value, upside and potential downside risks. 
 

• | Business with significant revenue and earnings growth potential. We seek to acquire one or more businesses that we believe will have multiple organic and M&A-driven growth opportunities over time and are well positioned to take advantage of secular, macroeconomic and credit trends, endure economic downturns, changes in the industry landscape and respond to evolving customer, supplier and competitor preferences. We search for attractive, growth-oriented businesses that exhibit sound, underlying fundamentals as well as demonstrated revenue growth and an existing or a clear path to attractive profitability. This includes such potential targets that are currently, or have the potential to be, category leaders with long-term growth potential.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Targets that can benefit from our relationships and experience. While we may pursue an initial business combination opportunity in any industry or sector, we continue to capitalize on our management team’s domain expertise acquired through decades of strategic deal-making in our targeted sectors. We believe our management team’s deep network of senior management, owners of businesses, board relationships and sophisticated private and public market investors give us a number of competitive advantages and present us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Our management team will leverage the broad spectrum of skills and expertise of our strategic advisory group, all of whom have extensive deal making, management and operational experience. We believe our team represents an exceptionally attractive combination of investing, capital markets, and operational experience that potential combination candidates will find highly desirable and complementary to their growth plans and will have the potential to substantially enhance shareholder value.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Companies with potential to benefit from the fourth industrial revolution. We seek to acquire one or more businesses which currently, or have the potential to, benefit from digital disruption positioning them to disintermediate or disrupt in their industry vertical, driven by the exponential increase in data generation, advances in artificial intelligence and robotics, rising processing power and/or ubiquitous global connectivity through smartphones, among other technologies. The technological impact of COVID-19 has been to accelerate trends that were already underway before the pandemic arose, including in the areas of remote working and learning, migration to cloud computing and productivity, mobile and interactive entertainment and transition from brick-and-mortar businesses to e-commerce. We believe that these trends are generating a significant market opportunity across our areas of focus in TMT and fintech.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Businesses with a strong transatlantic nexus. We have initially focused on companies in Europe, Israel and the Middle East whose current or future businesses have a nexus to the United States. These companies would benefit from having access to the deep public capital markets in the U.S. associated with a listing on the NYSE and access to capital to pursue accretive acquisitions, fund capital projects, pursue their growth strategies and/or strengthen their balances sheets. At the same time, we believe we are an attractive partner for those companies headquartered in North America seeking access and growth in Europe, Israel and the Middle East as we leverage our relationships with corporate customers and business partners to help expand their geographical footprint.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC. In addition to any 
 
8 

   potential business candidates we may identify on our own, other target business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds, and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 Pursuant to the NYSE listing rules, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Additionally, pursuant to the NYSE rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the NYSE, these rules will not be applicable to us. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own or acquire shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post- transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, including an Affiliated Joint Acquisition as described above. However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for the post-transaction company not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post- transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post- business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired by us is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair 
 market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. 
 We may, at our option, pursue an acquisition opportunity jointly with members of our management team (or their affiliates), which we refer to as an “Affiliated Joint Acquisition.” Any members of our management team or their affiliates may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of our initial business combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by undertaking a specified future issuance to such parties. 
 The amount and other terms and conditions of any such specified future issuance would be determined at the time thereof. We are not obligated to make any specified future issuance and may determine not to do so. Pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Class B common stock, any such specified future issuance would result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio such that our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees, if any, would retain their aggregate percentage ownership at 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon completion of our initial public offering plus all shares issued in the specified future issuance (excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued or issuable to any seller in the initial 
 
9 

   business combination), unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock agreed to waive such adjustment with respect to the specified future issuance at the time thereof. We cannot determine at this time whether a majority of the holders of our Class B common stock at the time of any such specified future issuance would agree to waive such adjustment to the conversion ratio. If such adjustment is not waived, the specified future issuance would not reduce the percentage ownership of holders of our Class B common stock, but would reduce the percentage ownership of our public stockholders. If such adjustment is waived, the specified future issuance would reduce the percentage ownership of holders of both classes of our common stock. 
 Our Acquisition Process 
 We believe that conducting comprehensive due diligence on prospective investments is important. We utilize the diligence, rigor, and expertise of our management team to evaluate potential targets’ strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities to identify the relative risk and return profile of any potential target for our initial business combination. Given our management team’s extensive investment experience, we may often be familiar with the prospective target’s end-market, competitive landscape and business model. 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspections of facilities, as well as reviewing financial and other information which will be made available to us. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Employees 
 We currently have three officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they have and intend to continue to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. 
Our Website 
 Our corporate website address is www.goldenfalconcorp.com. The information contained on, or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 We have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 
10 

  We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. We cannot assure you that any particular target business selected by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or IFRS and PCAOB standards or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP or IFRS and PCAOB standards. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements on our internal control over financial reporting. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
