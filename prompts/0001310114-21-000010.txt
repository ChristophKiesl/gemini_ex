About ServiceSource
ServiceSource is a leading provider of BPaaS solutions that enable the transformation of go-to-market organizations and functions for global technology clients. We design, deploy, and operate a suite of innovative solutions and complex processes that support and augment our clients’ B2B customer acquisition, engagement, expansion and retention activities. Our clients - ranging from Fortune 500 technology titans to high-growth disruptors and innovators - rely on our holistic customer engagement methodology and process excellence, global scale and delivery footprint, and data analytics and business insights to deliver trusted business outcomes that have a meaningful and material positive impact to their long-term revenue and profitability objectives. Through our unique integration of people, process and technology - leveraged against our more than 20 years of experience and domain expertise in the cloud, software, hardware, medical device and diagnostic equipment, and industrial IoT sectors - we effect and transact billions of dollars of B2B commerce in more than 175 countries on our clients’ behalf annually. 
Our services are delivered globally by approximately 2,800 professionals speaking 45 languages. Our net revenue was $194.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our Market Opportunity
Our clients operate in rapidly changing and dynamic environments where they face increasing pressure to gain market share, expand globally, accelerate revenue growth, and streamline operating expenses. In an era of more intense competition, rapid technology disruption, and lower customer switching costs, the most successful B2B companies are recognizing the imperative of a customer-centric mindset. Enabling and delivering a superior customer experience is mission-critical for these companies, yet many lack the appropriate internal resources and capabilities required for longstanding success. Increasingly, they are seeking strategic partners and thought leaders who possess the requisite expertise and proven competencies to enhance the loyalty and lifetime value of their customers by accelerating their go-to-market transformation strategies. Against this market opportunity backdrop, we believe ServiceSource is uniquely positioned and competitively differentiated to benefit from the following dynamics:
•Consumerization of B2B commerce. In today’s hyper-connected digital economy, individuals have become accustomed to engaging with B2C brands through channels and interactions that are efficient, effective and effortless. These individuals are bringing their consumer expectations into the workplace, fundamentally reshaping how companies market, sell to and engage with their business customers. The majority of business buyers expect their B2B customer experiences to mirror their B2C encounters and are willing to award a greater share of wallet and higher loyalty to vendors who can meet these raised expectations. While factors such as price, quality and feature functionality remain important considerations, leading B2B companies recognize that durable competitive advantage is increasingly based on facilitating interactions that are proactive, predictive and personalized across all touchpoints of the customer journey. We believe more companies are turning to external specialists like ServiceSource to structure, 
deploy and operate integrated solutions and processes that can holistically address and serve the unique and heightened demands of this emerging consumerization trend. 
•Deployment of customer-centric models that disrupt legacy go-to-market channels. Technology companies have relied for decades on a variety of third-party intermediaries to reach their mid-market customers. For many companies, 50% - 75% or more of their revenue has historically been attributed to indirect channels, including distributors, resellers, system integrators, and managed service providers, among others. These legacy routes to market are rapidly losing relevance due to the consumerization of IT, the growth of as-a-service offerings, the proliferation of cloud delivery and distribution models, and the rapid adoption of subscription and consumption-based billing plans. In light of these shifts and driven by a growing desire for greater customer insight and intimacy, more companies are deprioritizing investments away from these indirect channels, while assigning more focus to direct-to-consumer pathways. We believe these organizations are looking to strategic thought leaders such as ServiceSource who can help them reimagine their go-to-market strategies, accelerate their channel transformation initiatives, and design and manage new customer-centric operating models that will enable them to grow closer to their customers.
•Emergence of customer experience as a competitive differentiator. Increased global competition, lower barriers to entry and shortened product lifecycles are prompting technology companies to reassess their competitive advantage and reevaluate their core competencies. While areas such as intellectual property, engineering, research and development, and product development still remain core, successful forward-thinking organizations realize and appreciate the positive impact of a well-orchestrated customer experience on their revenue and profitability objectives. While these companies are attempting to allocate greater resources to build internal customer-facing capacity in areas including demand generation and conversion, account management, and customer success management, they are often encumbered by pre-existing organizational dynamics, departmental silos, and corporate inertia. We believe more companies will increasingly seek to partner with differentiated BPaaS providers like ServiceSource who can help them to more rapidly scale their customer experience initiatives with a value-driven and outcomes-based business case. Our clients choose us to help them drive greater customer engagement, trust, and loyalty given our integrated solution suite, demonstrable track record, proven process improvement methodology, global scale and infrastructure, and data expertise and insights.
Our Strategy and Solutions
Our strategy is to drive client success by bringing the world’s greatest brands closer to their customers through people-powered, digitally-enabled solutions and data-driven insights. We are pioneers in the CJXTM market and believe our solution scope, process expertise and global operating scale position us as a category leader. Our unified CJXTM solution suite spans the pre- and post-sale B2B customer journey and is deployed through a holistic model that enables our clients to more efficiently and effectively identify, land, adopt, expand and renew their customers and end-users.
The ServiceSource CJXTM solution suite has been built on three primary solution pillars, encompassing digital sales, customer success, and channel management, all underpinned by enabling competencies centered around our highly trained people, proprietary processes, and best-in-class technologies. Depending on our clients’ needs, we can provide our solutions and motions on a fully integrated basis or we can design and deploy them on a discrete, á la carte basis to address our clients’ unique requirements.
Digital sales. Through our digital sales solution, we help our clients accelerate their acquisition and expansion efforts across both net-new and installed-base customer accounts. Our core motions of demand qualification, demand conversion, and account management are designed to drive higher quality leads, improved pipeline hygiene, greater marketing and sales funnel velocity, better sales conversion rates, higher net expansion rates, and increased consumption for our clients’ products and services.
•Demand qualification. We serve as a seamless extension to our clients’ advertising, marketing, and digital demand generation activities. Through proactive customer interaction and leveraged with our data analytics expertise, our business development reps digitally engage with marketing-generated leads to evaluate and score their budget, authority, need, and timing to progress them through the funnel into sales-qualified and sales-accepted leads. 
•Demand conversion. We serve as a high velocity augmentation to our clients’ inside sales teams, allowing for enhanced coverage and increased conversion of their sales pipeline. Our sales development reps are extensively trained on our clients’ products, services, and features, and are experts at value- and persona-based selling. Through omnichannel media - including voice, chat, email, video, and social - our teams nurture leads, educate prospects, and conduct sales demos to convert qualified opportunities into confirmed orders and closed bookings for our clients.
•Account management. We serve as a natural complement to our clients’ installed-based account management sales motions. Our highly-skilled digital sales professionals develop, formulate, and implement account-based sales plans to identify and execute expansion selling opportunities, driving high margin incremental revenue for our clients through higher cloud consumption levels, upsell and cross-sell rates, multi-year conversions, and service and support attach rates. 
Customer success. Through our customer success solution, we are an integrated component of our clients’ customer experience strategies and engagement efforts. Our core motions of onboarding, adoption, and renewals management are uniquely tailored and customized to improve the satisfaction, referenceability, loyalty, retention and lifetime value of our clients’ customers. 
•Onboarding. Our onboarding experts engage and communicate with our clients’ new customers to ensure they are positioned for success from the first day of their relationship. We confirm subscriptions were successfully activated, downloads were successfully installed, assets and entitlements were successfully provisioned, and payments and credits were successfully applied. Where required, we further triage and support the coordination of our clients’ technical support and professional services resources to drive higher initial customer satisfaction and issue resolution outcomes.
•Adoption. Our adoption specialists are thoroughly trained and well-versed in the full range of features and functionality of our clients’ products, services and solutions. Leveraging telemetry from a variety of data feeds complemented with proactive real-time customer interaction, we ensure that our clients’ customers are appropriately educated, informed and empowered on how they can best achieve faster speed-to-value and return-on-investment for their subscription or purchase.
•Renewals management. Our renewals representatives are equipped with our industry-leading high-performance sales methodology and complemented by best-in-class technology and processes to manage revenue that may be at risk of loss for our clients. Our systems and global teams cleanse, validate, enhance and supplement our clients’ CRM and ERP data in order to proactively configure, price, quote and sell customer contracts that are nearing expiration or cancellation. Through extensive integration with our clients’ internal systems, teams and processes, we deliver performance outcomes that allow our clients to recognize lower customer churn and attrition, enhanced contract renewal rates, and higher revenue retention metrics.
Channel management. Through our channel management solution, we support the full lifecycle management of our clients’ indirect channels and routes to market. Our core motions of partner recruitment, partner onboarding and enablement, and partner success management are designed to increase partner mindshare, productivity, and sales of our clients’ products and services across both one-tier and two-tier distribution channel models.
•Partner recruitment. Our partner recruitment specialists are dedicated to identifying, vetting, and recruiting new distributors, value-added resellers, resellers, system integrators, managed service providers, agents and related third parties to join our clients’ channel partner programs. Through intensive research and proactive outreach, we ensure that our clients have an opportunity to expand their partner organizations with firms that are best positioned to more effectively market, sell and support our clients’ offerings in their respective regions and territories.
•Partner onboarding and enablement. Our partner onboarding specialists are thoroughly trained in the program design, tiering levels and criteria, and incentives available to partners through our clients’ channel programs. Through early engagement, intervention, and training, we promote greater program awareness, understanding, and focus for new partners, equipping them to achieve better early outcomes with our clients.
•Partner success management. Our partner success managers support our clients’ partners in developing and formulating quarterly and annual performance objectives, analyzing and forecasting sales and renewals pipelines, and identifying and resolving barriers to their success. Through ongoing engagement and interaction with our clients’ indirect partners, we proactively manage the relationships to ensure higher levels of success for our clients, the partners, and their mutual customers.
Our CJXTM solution suite is provided to our clients primarily through a unique outcomes-based, pay-for-performance model that ensures optimal alignment to their business growth priorities, return-on-investment mandates and customer experience objectives. Through this model, our clients pay us commissions that are either flat-rate or variable based on the bookings and/or revenue we generate on their behalf. For engagements where other pricing options are more appropriate, including our professional services, sales enablement and data management services, our clients pay us through either fixed-fee or full-time employee-based pricing models. Oftentimes our client contracts incorporate multiple pricing models to most appropriately balance our assessment of the data quality, operational complexity and risk-reward profile of the engagement. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 73% of our revenue was derived from pay-for-performance pricing arrangements and 27% was derived from fixed-fee or full-time employee-based pricing arrangements.
Our relationship with our clients begins in the pre-sales process and continues through the lifecycle of our engagement:
•Sales performance analysis. We typically begin engagements with our prospective clients by conducting a SPA. Through our SPA process, we conduct in-depth executive interviews and data analysis to understand a client’s unique challenges and desired business outcomes, evaluate and benchmark its performance against those outcomes, analyze opportunities for improvement using proprietary analytical models, and deliver expertise and recommendations to drive an enhanced customer experience, improved operational KPIs, and targeted financial gains. 
•Business case, pricing and contract structuring. We use our reservoir of data, benchmarks, and best practices to estimate the critical components of the business case, to calculate our ability to improve our clients’ performance based on our extensive track record of execution for similar engagements, to scope and design an optimal delivery model, and to derive an appropriate value-based pricing structure and contractual arrangement. 
•Data integration, implementation and launch. Once we have entered into a contract with a client, we deploy our professional services to rapidly integrate our tools and platforms with our clients’ systems, while our data and ops services teams ensure that high velocity data feeds are appropriately configured, mapped, loaded, enabled, and enhanced. Our talent acquisition teams launch a highly selective recruiting and onboarding process, while our learning and development teams build and deliver a robust training curriculum and certification program.
•Performance and execution. Following the implementation and ramp of an engagement, we leverage our reporting platform, data reservoir, and performance optimization tools to continuously monitor, measure, analyze, benchmark, and enhance the performance of our teams to ensure we are positioned to deliver against the business case and exceed our clients’ expectations.
•Client benchmarking and continuous improvement. Our extensive platform and the accumulation of more than 20 years of experience serve as the foundation for benchmarking our clients’ performance against internal parity rates, industry peers, and previous performance periods. We generally conduct monthly and quarterly business review meetings and host frequent executive steering reviews with our clients to assess our results, identify potential process gaps, determine opportunities for continuous improvement, and make recommendations that we believe will allow our clients and us to achieve higher levels of performance and efficiencies.
Markets We Serve
We target our solutions exclusively to B2B technology companies and focus on chosen market segments where we have deep domain expertise, proven competencies and best practices, robust executive relationships, and the ability to leverage existing client references and advocacy. 
•Cloud and SaaS. In this segment, we serve companies who provide their solutions via public, private, or hybrid cloud delivery models, including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS vendors. Within this market, customers and end-users typically purchase from our clients through a recurring subscription or a consumption-based utility billing model. IDC, a market research firm, estimates the total global market for cloud software was approximately $205 billion in 2020 with a forecasted 16% compound annual growth rate through 2024.
•Software. Our clients in this segment include companies who primarily provide their software in an on premise environment, where our clients’ customers and end-users typically pay for a defined number of licenses or subscribers, as well as related software support, maintenance and service contracts. We have developed extensive expertise in a variety of software sub-sectors, supporting vendors of application and system software, collaboration software, CRM software, cyber-security software, open source operating system software, and virtualization software, among others. 
IDC estimates the total global market for software license and maintenance was approximately $300 billion in 2020, while the software subscription market was approximately $260 billion in 2020 with a forecasted 17% compound annual growth rate through 2024.
•Hardware. In this segment, we serve companies who provide IT hardware and related assets, including data center systems (servers, storage, gateways, and arrays), networking and communications equipment (switches, routers, access points, and appliances), and computing equipment and peripherals (workstations, PCs, thin-clients, and imaging devices), among others. Within this segment, our services are primarily directed at selling, renewing, and extending hardware maintenance and support contracts on our clients’ behalf. IDC estimates the total global market for hardware maintenance and support was approximately $64 billion in 2020 with a forecasted 2% compound annual growth rate through 2024.
•Medical device and diagnostic equipment. Our clients in this segment include companies who provide products, software and services to the healthcare and medical field, including vendors of radiology and diagnostic imaging equipment, surgical and laboratory instruments, and healthcare IT software, among others.

Grand View Research, a market research firm, estimates the total global market for industrial IoT applications was approximately $215 billion 2020 with a forecasted 35% compound annual growth rate through 2025.
Our Clients
We seek to build long-term, durable relationships with leading companies and high-growth innovators within each of our target markets, where our strategy, solutions, and capabilities provide a compelling client value proposition and opportunity for us to drive enduring client success and trusted business outcomes. We typically enter into multi-year contracts with our clients with average terms ranging from two to four years. Our client contracts are generally comprised of a master services agreement, which is a framework agreement that defines broad governing terms, supplemented by one or multiple order forms or statements of work that outline detailed terms, conditions, pricing, description of services and definition of scope. While most of our contracts may be terminated for convenience with relatively short notice, often subject to the payment of an early termination fee by the client, our top 10 client relationships range in duration from 8 to 14 years, with an average tenure of approximately 11 years.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, our top ten clients each generated more than $4.0 million in revenue and represented a combined 78% of our total net revenue, and four clients each represented over 10% of our revenue during this period. A relatively small number of clients may continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. The loss of revenue from any of our significant clients for any reason may cause a significant decrease in our revenue.
Human Capital
We believe our people are our greatest asset and central to the success of ServiceSource and our clients. Through our core values of trust, caring, collaboration, and dedication, we direct our efforts and invest extensive resources to ensure we attract, hire, develop, incentivize, promote, and retain a world-class workforce. We are committed to building a culture that inspires success for our people and fostering a workplace environment that promotes trust, diversity, and inclusion while providing multiple avenues for continuous personal and professional development. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,800 employees worldwide, of which nearly all were full-time, with 70% located outside of the U.S. Our employees are not covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Employee health and well-being. We believe a loyal and productive workforce requires a holistic approach to caring for the whole self. We provide a variety of programs and benefits to support the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health and well-being of our employees. 
We are committed to the health and safety of our employees. To keep our employees safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, we created a dedicated crisis team to proactively implement business continuity plans and quickly transitioned to a 100% work-from-home model. As a result of this successful work-from-home implementation, we have shifted to a virtual-first operating model whereby our employees will continue to primarily work from their home offices and our facilities will be used for collaboration, innovation, and connection. Additionally, this model includes virtual sourcing, hiring, and onboarding for new employees as well as a process for driving performance and culture in a virtual environment. 
Inclusion and diversity. We believe high-performing organizations are defined by policies and practices that encourage and celebrate an inclusive and diverse workforce. We have adopted metrics that measure the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of 
our organization and practices to ensure our organization is representative of the communities we serve. We are committed to equal pay for equal work, and continually monitor and analyze our compensation programs for equality. 
In 2020, we further advanced our gender equality initiative with women representing half of our total employee base and more than one-third of our leadership ranks.
Benefits. We offer a complete set of benefits for our employees, including competitive base salaries, annual cash bonuses and an equity incentive program, as well as comprehensive health benefits, retirement plans, and a generous time off policy. For our U.S.-based employees, we offer 12 weeks of paid parental (maternal and paternal) leave, providing important support for our employees as they strive to care for, bond with and welcome new family members and integrate family life with work life. In addition, every employee receives a day of birthday time off, to enable that employee to celebrate on a day during the month of their birth. 
Community engagement and involvement. We are active and involved members in the communities in which our employees live and work, and we promote a culture of volunteering and giving back. Every employee globally receives eight hours of paid volunteer time off annually, which encourages our employees to serve the communities in which we live and work. Through our paid volunteer time off program, our employees collectively volunteered more than 5,300 hours supporting a variety of charitable causes and organizations in their communities during 2020.
Training, development, and performance. In July 2020, we launched CJXTM University, a world-class learning and development platform designed to help employees grow and develop in their careers. Since launch, our employees have logged more than 18,000 training hours. Additionally, we hold bi-annual unrated performance reviews, designed to encourage employees to have conversations with their managers relating to their areas of strength and growth opportunities and allowing for a plan for future career progression and development.
Competition and Our Competitive Strengths
The market for our BPaaS services and CJXTM solution suite is dynamic and evolving. Historically, B2B companies have managed their customer acquisition, engagement, expansion, and retention efforts internally and have relied upon a variety of third-party technologies and tools - including enterprise resource planning software, customer relationship management software, customer success management software, business intelligence software, channel management software, customer experience management software, and sales enablement software - from vendors such as Adobe, Gainsight, Medallia, Oracle, SAP, salesforce.com, and XANT, to enable their in-house teams and workflows. Some companies have made further investments in this area using firms such as Accenture, Deloitte Digital and McKinsey & Company for customer experience design and digital transformation consulting services for their go-to-market organizations. These internally developed solutions represent the primary alternative to our integrated approach of combining people, processes and technology to provide a purpose-built, end-to-end optimized solution.
We believe we are the only company of scale exclusively focused on serving the unique requirements of B2B technology companies with a solution suite that addresses the entirety of the customer journey experience continuum. Within the broader BPaaS market, at times we may compete with larger, more diversified and less-focused companies such as Cognizant, Convergys, Genpact, TTEC, and Webhelp, as well as smaller companies offering more narrow point solutions such as MarketStar and N3 Results.
We believe our principal competitive strengths and differentiators include our:
•20+ year track record of innovation and market leadership;
•B2B technology industry domain expertise;
•ability to drive client success and value;
•scope and completeness of our solution;
•robust global delivery footprint and infrastructure;
•extensive geographic and language coverage model;
•outcomes-based, pay-for-performance pricing;
•data-driven insights, best practices and benchmarks;
•speed and agility;
•experience and quality of our leadership team;
•reputation and referenceable client base; and
•size and financial stability of our operations.
Although we currently have few direct competitors that offer integrated solutions at our scale, we expect competition and competitive pressure, from both new and existing competitors, to increase in the future.
Our Intellectual Property
We believe our ability to innovate is a key driver of value for our clients and our business. The solutions we provide to our clients often include a variety of proprietary tools, technologies, processes, methodologies, and expertise which comprise our intellectual property. In addition, our intellectual property includes patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as well as various trade secrets, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We protect our intellectual property by leveraging U.S. and foreign patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, in addition to entering into non-competition, confidentiality, non-disclosure, and related intellectual property protection agreements with our clients, employees, contractors and suppliers.
Partnerships and Alliances
We routinely enter into partnerships and alliances with companies that can enhance our solutions, differentiate our capabilities, advance our technologies and tools, and complement our sales and marketing activities. These relationships include strategic go-to-market alliances, joint-selling agreements, “white-labeled” technology integrations and business transformation and consulting partners.
