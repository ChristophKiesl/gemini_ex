Item 1.
Business
 We are a Fortune 200 corporation and a leading provider of a comprehensive range of distribution, systems design and integration solutions for the technology industry. We also provided outsourced services focused on customer experience to a broad range of enterprises.
 On December 1, 2020, we completed the previously announced separation of our customer experience services business (the “Separation”), which was accomplished by the distribution of one hundred percent of the outstanding common stock of Concentrix Corporation (“Concentrix”) to our stockholders as of the close of business on November 17, 2020, the record date for the distribution. Our stockholders received one share of Concentrix common stock for every share of our common stock held at the close of business on the record date. Concentrix is now an independent public company trading under the symbol “CNXC” on the Nasdaq Stock Market. After the Separation, we do not beneficially own any shares of Concentrix’ common stock and beginning December 1, 2020, we no longer consolidate Concentrix within our financial results or reflect the financial results of Concentrix within our continuing results of operations. We distributed a total of approximately 51.6 million shares of Concentrix common stock to our stockholders. In connection with the Separation, we have entered into a separation and distribution agreement, as well as various other agreements with Concentrix that provide a framework for the relationships between the parties going forward, including among others an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, and a commercial agreement, pursuant to which Concentrix will continue to provide services to us following the Separation.
 As of November 30, 2020, we were organized to provide our products and services through two reportable business segments: Technology Solutions and Concentrix. Our Technology Solutions segment distributes peripherals, information technology (“IT”) systems including data center server and storage solutions, system components, software, networking, communications and security

equipment, consumer electronics (“CE”) and complementary products. Within our Technology Solutions segment, we also provide systems design and integration solutions. Our Concentrix segment offered a portfolio of technology-infused strategic solutions and end-to-end business services focused on customer experience, process optimization, technology innovation, front and back-office automation and business transformation to clients in five primary industry verticals.
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we distribute more than 40,000 technology products (as measured by active SKUs) from more than 500 IT, CE and original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), suppliers to more than 25,000 resellers, system integrators, and retailers throughout the United States, Canada, Japan, Mexico and Central and South America. We purchase peripherals, IT systems, system components, software, networking, communications and security equipment, CE and complementary products from our suppliers and sell them to our reseller and retail customers. We perform a similar function for our distribution of licensed software products. Our reseller customers include value-added resellers, corporate resellers, government resellers, system integrators, direct marketers, and national and regional retailers. We combine our core strengths in distribution with demand generation, supply chain management and design and integration solutions to help our customers achieve greater efficiencies in time to market, cost minimization, real-time linkages in the supply chain and aftermarket product support. We also provide comprehensive IT solutions in key vertical markets such as government and healthcare and we provide specialized service offerings that increase efficiencies in the areas of print management, renewals, logistics services and supply chain management. Additionally, we provide our customers with systems design and integration solutions for data center servers and networking solutions built specific to our customers’ workloads and data center environments.
 Our Technology Solutions business is characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue, or operating margin. The market for IT and CE products is generally characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles. We set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product or bundle of products we distribute and services we provide.
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we are highly dependent on the end-market demand for IT and CE products, and on our partners’ strategic initiatives and business models. This end-market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new IT and CE products and software by OEMs, replacement cycles for existing IT and CE products, trends toward cloud computing, overall economic growth and general business activity. A difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the IT and CE industries and increased price-based competition.
 In our Concentrix segment, we provided a comprehensive range of strategic services and solutions to enhance our clients’ customer life cycles to acquire, support and renew customer relationships, to automate and optimize processes, to maximize the value of every customer experience and to improve business outcomes. Our portfolio of services included end-to-end process outsourcing to customers in various industry vertical markets delivered through omni-channels that included both voice and non-voice media and in more than 70 languages. Our portfolio of solutions and services supported our clients and their customers globally.
 Our Concentrix segment generated revenue from performing services that were generally tied to our clients’ products and services and how they are received in the marketplace. Any shift in business or size of the market for our clients’ products, any failure of technology or failure of acceptance of our clients’ products in the market could impact the Concentrix business. The employee turnover rate in this business and the risk of losing experienced employees is high. Higher turnover rates can increase costs and decrease operating efficiencies and productivity.
 We have been in business since 1980 and are headquartered in Fremont, California. We have significant operations in North and South America, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Africa. We were originally incorporated in the State of California as COMPAC Microelectronics, Inc. in November 1980, and we changed our name to SYNNEX Information Technologies, Inc. in February 1994. We later reincorporated in the State of Delaware under the name of SYNNEX Corporation in October 2003. As of November 30, 2020, we had approximately 280,000 full-time and temporary employees worldwide, and on December 1, 2020 following the Separation we had approximately 8,800 full-time and temporary employees worldwide.
 Financial information by segment is provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.
 Our Products and Suppliers
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we distribute a broad line of IT products, including peripherals, IT systems, system components, software, security, UCC and networking equipment from more than 500 OEM suppliers, enabling us to offer comprehensive solutions to our reseller and retail customers. Our product offerings also include systems design and full rack integration solutions, build-to-order, and configure-to-order assemblies. Our Technology Solutions segment represented 81%, 80% and 88% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Table of Content
 
For fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, our product mix by category in the Technology Solutions segment was in the following ranges:
 
 
Product Category: | 
--------------------------------------------+----------
Peripherals | 21% - 25%
IT Systems | 30% - 35%
System Components and Integration Solutions | 9% - 14% 
Software | 16% - 20%
Networking Equipment | 13% - 15%

 
Our suppliers include leading peripherals, IT systems, system components, software, security, networking equipment, UCC and CE manufacturers. Our primary OEM suppliers are Alphabet Inc. (Google), ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., HP Inc. (“HP”), Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company, Intel Corporation, Lenovo Group Ltd, Microsoft Corporation, and Samsung Semiconductor, Inc.
 Our largest OEM supplier is HP. Revenue from the sale of products and services provided by HP represented approximately 12%, 12% and 13% of our consolidated revenue for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As is typical with our OEM supplier agreements, our United States Business Development Partner Agreement with HP is short-term and may be terminated without cause upon short notice. In the event of any breach of the agreement by us, HP may terminate the agreement and we may be required to refund HP any discounts or program payments paid during the period we were in breach of the agreement and reimburse HP for reasonable attorneys’ fees. In the event the agreement is terminated for cause or if we fail to perform our obligations under the agreement, our agreement with HP for the resale of products, support and services will automatically terminate upon such default or termination. If either party becomes insolvent or bankrupt, the other party may terminate the agreement without notice and cancel any unfulfilled obligations, except for payment obligations. Some of our subsidiaries also have territorial supplier agreements with subsidiaries of HP located in the respective countries.
 We have distribution agreements with most of our suppliers, including HP. These agreements usually provide for nonexclusive distribution rights and pertain to specific geographic territories. The agreements are also generally short-term, subject to periodic renewal, and often contain provisions permitting termination by either our supplier or us without cause upon relatively short notice. An OEM supplier that elects to terminate a distribution agreement will generally repurchase its products carried in our inventory.
 Our Technology Solutions business subjects us to the risk that the value of our inventory will be affected adversely by suppliers’ price reductions or by technological changes affecting the usefulness or desirability of the products comprising our inventory. Many of our OEM suppliers offer us limited protection from the loss in value of our inventory due to technological change or a supplier’s price reduction. Under many of these agreements, we have a limited period of time to return or exchange products or claim price protection credits. We monitor our inventory levels and attempt to time our purchases to maximize our protection under supplier programs.
 Our Customers
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we distribute IT products to more than 25,000 resellers, system integrators and retailers. Resellers are classified primarily by their end-user customers. End-users include large corporations or enterprises, federal, state and local governments, small/medium sized businesses, or SMBs, and individual consumers. In addition, resellers vary greatly in size and geographic reach. Our reseller customers buy from us and other distributors. Our larger reseller customers also buy certain products directly from OEM suppliers. System integrators offer services in addition to product resale, primarily in systems customization, integration, and deployment. Retailers serve mostly individual end-users and to a small degree, small office/home office customers. We also provide systems design and integration solutions for data center servers built for our customers’ data center environments.
 In our Concentrix segment, we served over 650 clients in five primary industry verticals: banking, financial services and insurance; communications and media; healthcare; retail, travel and e-commerce; and technology and consumer electronics. We focused on developing long-term, strategic relationships with large companies in these customer-intensive industry verticals to benefit from the complexity of services required, the anticipated growth of their market segments and their increasing need for more cost-effective customer experience services.
 One customer accounted for 19% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 and 17% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2018. We do not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on us.
 Our Services and Solutions
 We offer a variety of business process services to our customers. These services can be purchased individually or they can be purchased in combination with others in the form of supply chain solutions and aftermarket product support. The two major categories of services and solutions provided up to November 30, 2020 included Technology Solutions and Concentrix:

We offer our OEM suppliers a full range of marketing activities targeting resellers, system integrators and retailers including direct mail, external media advertising, reseller product training, targeted telemarketing campaigns, national and regional trade shows, trade groups, database analysis, print on demand services and web-based marketing.
 Concentrix. Our Concentrix segment represented 19%, 20% and 12% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We offered a portfolio of technology-infused comprehensive solutions and end-to-end business outsourcing services to approximately 650 clients around the world in five primary industry verticals. 
 We operated from over 284 locations in numerous countries throughout the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Africa. Services were provided from these global locations to clients worldwide in more than 70 languages. Our portfolio of services was sold as integrated solutions to clients which included:
 Customer Lifecycle Management. Services provided to our clients’ customers across multiple media, such as intelligent self-service, voice, chat, social, messaging, email and knowledge management, supported our client’s entire customer care lifecycle. This included services such as welcome and activation calls, billing, payments, product and service inquiries, complaint resolution, customer surveys and emergency response. We also provided back office support for these processes which include document management, claims management, fraud prevention, mortgage document verification, rebate management as a few examples. We also provided services that provide feedback to our clients. This was provided through a dedicated team of professionals to deliver data-driven insights to our clients to improve the customer experience through analytics and consulting, and software solutions, such as, Enterprise Feedback Management/Multi-channel, Voice of Customer Software, Integrated Customer Experience Analytics, Post-Contact Surveys, Relational Loyalty Research, Customer Segmentation and Profiling, Call Elimination Analysis, Analysis of Customer Effort, Digital Channel Optimization, and Integrated Contact Center Analytics.
 Marketing Solutions. Our services included data-driven customer acquisition and retention marketing solutions across digital, social, mobile and print channels that helped our clients manage their marketing through a diverse distribution channel enabling each constituent in the channel to participate in targeting end customers with the right brand experience.

Third Party Administration of Insurance Policies. We were a licensed Third Party Administrator of certain types of insurance policies that were managed through our proprietary insurance management system as well as other third-party systems. The services were provided primarily in the United States.
 Enterprise Mobile Development. We provided mobile application development across multiple industries for both IOS and Android devices that are focused on Enterprise deployments. Services within this group included UX/UI designed/development, optimization of applications and movement of on-premise systems to the cloud.
 Automation and Process Optimization. We delivered focused front office solutions with workflows and macro/desktop automation that drive improved staff efficiency and implemented cognitive systems/robotic process automation to replace manual touch points. These services used both internal technology assets as well as third party tools.
 Technology Assets. We licensed a number of our technology assets without being bundled with services which enabled our clients to be more efficient, drive higher visibility to data and identify valuable customer patterns and insights from enterprise data to design better customer experience strategies. These assets were used within our portfolio of services as well.
Sales and Marketing
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we serve our large commercial, government reseller, and retail customers through dedicated sales professionals. We market to smaller resellers and OEMs through dedicated regional sales teams. In addition, we have dedicated product management and business development specialists that focus on the sale and promotion of products and services of selected suppliers or for specific end-market verticals. These specialists are also directly involved in establishing new relationships with leading OEMs to create demand for their products and services and with resellers for their customers’ needs. We also have a direct sales approach for our design and integration solutions business. Our sales and marketing professionals are complemented by members of our executive management team who are integral in identifying potential new customer opportunities, promoting sales growth and ensuring customer satisfaction. We have sales and marketing professionals in close geographic proximity to our reseller, retail and OEM customers.
 In our Concentrix segment, we marketed our services through a sales force organized by industry vertical and geography. The length of our selling cycle varied depending on the type of engagement. Our efforts could begin in response to our lead generation program, a perceived opportunity, a reference by an existing client, a request for proposal or otherwise. The sales cycle varied depending on the type of services, as well as the existence of established relationships with the client.
 We had designated client partners or global relationship managers for each of our strategic relationships. The relationship manager was supported by process improvement, quality, transition, finance, human resources, information technology and industry or subject matter expert teams to ensure the best possible solution is provided to our clients.
 We also strived to foster relationships between our senior leadership team and our clients’ senior management. These “C-level” relationships ensured that both parties were focused on establishing priorities, aligning objectives and driving client value from the top down. High-level executive relationships were particularly constructive as a means of increasing business from our existing clients. It also provided us with a forum for addressing client concerns. We constantly measured our client satisfaction levels to ensure that we maintained high service levels for each client.
 Our Operations
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we operate approximately 63 distribution and administrative facilities in the United States, Canada, Japan, Mexico, China, and Central and South America. Our distribution processes are highly automated to reduce errors, ensure timely order fulfillment and enhance the efficiency of our warehouse operations and back office administration. Our distribution facilities are geographically dispersed to be near reseller customers and their end-users. This decentralized, regional strategy enables us to benefit from lower shipping costs and shorter delivery lead times to our customers. Furthermore, we track several performance measurements to continuously improve the efficiency and accuracy of our distribution operations. Our regional locations also enable us to make local deliveries and provide will-call fulfillment to more customers than if our distribution operations were more centralized, resulting in better service to our customers. Our workforce is comprised of permanent and temporary employees, enabling us to respond to short-term changes in order activity.
 Our proprietary IT systems and processes enable us to automate many of our distribution operations. We use radio frequency and bar code scanning technologies in all of our warehouse operations to maintain real-time inventory records, facilitate frequent cycle counts and improve the accuracy of order fulfillment.
 To enhance the accuracy of our distribution order fulfillment and protect our inventory from shrinkage, our distribution systems also incorporate numerous controls. These controls include order weight checks, bar code scanning, and serial number profile verification. We also use digital video imaging to record our small package shipping activities by order. These images and other warehouse and shipping data are available online to our customer service representatives, enabling us to quickly respond to order inquiries by our customers.

We operate our principal system design and integration solutions facilities in the United States, and we operate integration facilities in the United Kingdom and China. We generally design and integrate IT systems, data center servers and networking solutions and IT appliances, by incorporating system components purchased directly from vendors or obtained from our distribution inventory. Additionally, we perform other production value-added services, including thermal testing, power-draw efficiency testing, burn-in, quality and logistics support. Some of our design and integration solutions facilities are ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 14001:2015 certified.
 In our Concentrix segment, we had global delivery capability which allowed us to scale people and other resources from around the world, including foreign language fluency, proximity to clients and time-zone advantages. A critical component of this capability was our over 284 delivery and administrative centers in 40 countries throughout North and South America, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Africa. Our delivery centers improved the efficiency of our engagement teams through the reuse of processes, solution designs and infrastructure by leveraging the experience of delivery center professionals. Services were provided from these global locations to clients worldwide in multiple languages. These services were supported by proprietary technology to enable efficient and secure customer contact through various methods including voice, chat, web, email, social media and digital and mobility competencies by providing improved business intelligence and performance through enabling technologies. All of our delivery centers were PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council's Data Security Standards) version 3.2.1 certified. All of our delivery centers were certified to ISO standards. Twenty-nine of our delivery centers around the world were certified to COPC (Customer Operation Performance Center) OSP standard.
 We operated a distributed data processing environment that could integrate service delivery center data servers and databases with nineteen data centers and point of presence strategically located across the globe. Our technologically-advanced and secured data centers provided availability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with redundant power and communication feeds and emergency power back-up, and were designed to withstand most natural disasters.
 The capacity of our data center and contact center operations, coupled with the scalability of our customer management solutions, enabled us to meet the changing needs of large-scale and rapidly growing companies and government entities. By employing the scale and efficiencies of common application platforms, we could provide client-specific enhancements and modifications without incurring many of the costs of a full custom application, which positioned us as a value-added provider of customer support products and services.
 International Operations
 Approximately 34% of our consolidated revenue for fiscal year 2020 was generated by our international operations. Our end market strategy for our Technology Solutions business, while focused on the Americas, is expanding internationally on a selective basis in order to provide our distribution capabilities to OEMs in locations that meet their regional requirements. A key element in our business strategy had been to locate our Concentrix service delivery contact centers in markets that were strategic to our client requirements and cost beneficial. Our Concentrix segment had significant operations in the Philippines and India.
 Sales and cost concentrations in foreign jurisdictions subject us to various risks, including the impact of changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the US Dollar, which in turn can impact reported sales.
 See Note 11 -- Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional financial information related to international and domestic operations.
 Seasonality
 Our operating results in the Technology Solutions segment are affected by the seasonality of the IT and CE products industries. We have historically experienced higher sales in our fourth fiscal quarter due to patterns in capital budgeting, federal government spending and purchasing cycles of our customers and end-users. These patterns may not be repeated in subsequent periods.
 Revenue in our Concentrix segment was typically the highest in our fourth fiscal quarter.
 Purchasing
 In our Technology Solutions segment, product cost represents our single largest expense and IT and CE product inventory is one of our largest working capital investments. Furthermore, product procurement from our OEM suppliers is a highly complex process that involves incentive programs, rebate programs, price protection, volume and early payment discounts and other arrangements. Consequently, efficient and effective purchasing operations are critical to our success.
 Our purchasing group works closely with many areas of our organization, especially our product managers who work closely with our OEM suppliers and our sales force, to understand the volume and mix of IT products that should be purchased.

In addition, the purchasing group utilizes an internally developed, proprietary information systems application that further aids in forecasting future product demand based on several factors, including historical sales levels, expected product life cycle and current and projected economic conditions. We may also rely on our receipt of good-faith, non-binding, customer forecasts. We maintain electronic data interchange, or EDI, connection with our OEM suppliers to send purchase orders, receive purchase order status and receive notification once the product has shipped from our supplier. Our information system also tracks warehouse and channel inventory levels and open purchase orders on a real-time basis enabling us to stock inventory at a regional level closer to the customer as well as to actively manage our working capital resources. This level of automation promotes greater efficiencies of inventory management by replenishing and turning inventory, as well as placing purchase orders on a more frequent basis. Furthermore, our system tool also allows for automated checks and controls to prevent the generation of inaccurate orders.
 Managing our OEM supplier incentive programs is another critical function of our purchasing and product management teams. We attempt to maximize the benefits of incentives, rebates and volume and early payment discounts that our OEM suppliers offer us from time to time. We carefully evaluate these supplier incentive benefits relative to our product handling and carrying costs so that we do not over-invest in our inventory. We also closely monitor inventory levels on a product-by-product basis and plan purchases to take advantage of OEM supplier provided price protection. By managing inventory levels and monitoring customer purchase patterns at each of our regional distribution facilities, we believe we can minimize our shipping costs by stocking products near our resellers and retailers, and their end-user customers.
 Financial Services
 In our Technology Solutions segment, we offer various financing options to our customers as well as prepayment, credit card and cash on delivery terms. In providing credit terms to our reseller and retail customers, we closely and regularly monitor their creditworthiness through our information systems, credit ratings information and periodic detailed credit file reviews by our financial services staff. We have also purchased credit insurance in some geographies to further control credit risks. Finally, we establish reserves for estimated credit losses in the normal course of business based on the overall quality and aging of our accounts receivable portfolio, the existence of a limited amount of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks.
 We also sell to certain reseller customers pursuant to third party floor plan financing. The expenses charged by these financing companies are subsidized either by our OEM suppliers or paid by us. We generally receive payment from these financing companies within 15 to 30 days from the date of sale, depending on the specific arrangement.
 Information Technology
 Within our Technology Solutions segment, our IT systems manage the entire order cycle, including processing customer orders, customer billing and payment tracking. These internally developed IT systems make our operations more efficient and provide visibility into our operations. We believe our IT infrastructure is scalable to support further growth. We continue to enhance and invest in our IT systems to improve product and inventory management, streamline order and fulfillment processes, and increase operational flexibility.
 To allow our customers and suppliers to communicate and transact business with us in an efficient and consistent manner, we have implemented a mix of proprietary and off-the-shelf software programs that integrate our IT systems with those of our customers and suppliers. In particular, we maintain EDI, XML, web-based communication links and mobile platform applications with many of our reseller and retail customers to enable them to search for products, check real-time pricing, inventory availability and specifications, place and track orders, receive invoices and process returns.
 Within our Concentrix segment, we invested in IT systems, infrastructure, automation and security to enhance workforce management and improve productivity. Our contact centers could employ a broad range of technology, including digital switching, intelligent call routing and tracking, proprietary workforce management systems, case management tools, proprietary software systems, computer telephony integration, interactive voice response, advanced speech recognition, web-based tools and relational database management systems with embedded security. Our innovative use of technology enabled us to improve our voice, chat, web and e-mail handling and personnel scheduling, thereby increasing our efficiency and enhancing the quality of the services we delivered to our clients and their customers. We were able to respond to changes in client call volumes and manage call volume traffic based on agent availability. Additionally, we could use this technology to collect information concerning the contacts, including number, response time, duration and results of the contact and report the information to the client on a periodic basis for purposes of monitoring quality of service and accuracy of billing.
 Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive global environment. The IT product industry is characterized by intense competition, based primarily on product availability, credit terms, price, speed and accuracy of delivery, effectiveness of sales and marketing programs, ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines, pre- and post-sale technical support, flexibility and timely response to design changes, technological capabilities and product quality, service and support. We compete with a variety of regional, national and international IT product distributors and manufacturers.

Table of Content
 
Our major competitors in our Technology Solutions segment include Arrow Electronics, Inc., Ingram Micro, Inc., ScanSource, Inc., and Tech Data Corporation and, to a lesser extent, regional distributors. We also face competition from our OEM suppliers that sell directly to resellers, retailers and end-users. The distribution industry has historically undergone, and continues to undergo, consolidation. Over the years, a number of providers within the IT distribution industry exited or merged with other providers. For example, during fiscal year 2017, we acquired the Westcon-Comstor Americas distribution business and Tech Data Corporation acquired the Technology Solutions operating group of Avnet Inc. We have participated in this consolidation and expect to continue to assess opportunities.
 As we enter new business areas, we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors and/or new competitors. Some of our competitors are substantially larger and may have greater financial, operating, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Some of our competitors may have broader geographic breadth and range of services than us. Some may have more developed relationships with their existing customers. In the Technology Solutions segment we attempt to offset our comparative scale difference by focusing on a limited number of leading OEMs by running a more efficient and low-cost operation, and by offering a high level of value-added and customer services. In the Concentrix Segment, we attempted to offset our comparative scale difference through efficiency, low-cost operations and by offering a high level of value-added customer services.
 In our Concentrix segment, we operated in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving global marketplace. Our competitors were both regional players as well as global companies. Our major competitors included Accenture plc, Genpact Limited, Teleperformance S.A., TTEC Holdings, Inc., Conduent, Inc., Transcosmos Inc., Sykes Enterprises Inc., and Globant S.A.
 We constantly seek to expand our business into areas primarily related to our core distribution as well as other support, logistics and related value-added services, both organically and through strategic acquisitions.
 Human Capital Resources
 As of November 30, 2020, we had approximately 270,000 full-time associates. Approximately 7,500 of those full-time associates worked in our Technology Solutions segment. Given the variability in our business and the quick response time required by customers, it is critical that we are able to rapidly ramp-up and ramp-down our operational capabilities to maximize efficiency. As a result, we use temporary or contract workers, who totaled approximately 7,900, on a full-time equivalent basis, as of November 30, 2020, approximately 1,300 of whom worked in our Technology Solutions segment. Except for a small number of our employees in certain countries, where it is required by local regulations or associates brought in through acquisitions, our employees are not represented by a labor union, nor are they covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 
 We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and retains exceptional talent. Through ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety and employee wellbeing, we strive to help our employees in all aspects of their lives so they can do their best work. With the completion of the Separation on December 1, 2020, our discussion about our human capital resources is focused on our Technology Solutions segment.
 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 We are committed to being unconditionally inclusive to capture the ideas and perspectives that fuel innovation and enable our workforce, customers, and communities to succeed in the digital age. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where people can bring their authentic selves to work. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled and diverse board of directors. Women represent 25% of our board of directors and 43% of our associate base. We strive to remain a diverse company. Robert Huang, founder of our company, wanted to ensure we had the best associates regardless of their age, ethnicity, or gender. His legacy and our primary focus is to work hard, do well, and treat others with respect.
Pay Equity or Total Rewards
 We believe people should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of their job, and their performance. We also review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable. We have reviewed the compensation of employees to ensure consistent pay practices by conducting a pay equity analysis annually comparing employees in the same role within a country/location.
 We require a uniquely talented workforce and are committed to providing total rewards that are market-competitive and performance-based, driving innovation and operational excellence. Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with, and drives, stockholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent.

Employee Engagement
 We regularly collect feedback to better understand and improve the employee experience and identify opportunities to continually strengthen our culture. We want to know what is working well, what we can do better and how well our associates understand and are practicing our cultural values. In 2020, nearly 80% of associates participated in our annual employee survey.
 
Training and Development
 Human capital development underpins our efforts to execute our strategy and continue to distribute, design, integrate and market innovative products and services. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development.
Health, Safety and Wellness
 The physical health, financial wellbeing, life balance and mental health of our employees is vital to our success. Our environmental, health, and safety leadership team uses our global injury and illness reporting system to assess trends regionally and worldwide as a part of quarterly reviews. Our warehouse and integration facilities continue to represent our most significant health and safety risks. Managing and reducing risks at these facilities remains a focus, and injury rates continue to be low. We also sponsor a wellness program designed to enhance physical, financial, and mental wellbeing for all our employees. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, and other incentives. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our associates manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on employee wellbeing, health and safety. We have successfully transitioned most of our workforce in both segments to a remote working environment and implemented a number of safety and social distancing measures within our premises to protect the health and safety of associates who are required to be on-premise to support our business.
