ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for genetically defined diseases. Our approach is to design rational precision therapies that treat the underlying cause of disease and improve the lives of patients. Our most advanced program is CGT9486, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to potently inhibit the KIT D816V mutation as well as other mutations in KIT exon 17. In the vast majority of cases, KIT D816V is responsible for driving Systemic Mastocytosis (SM), a serious disease caused by unchecked proliferation of mast cells. Exon 17 mutations are also found in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), a type of cancer with strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. CGT9486 is a highly selective and potent KIT inhibitor with the potential to provide a new treatment option for these patient populations.
 CGT9486 has been administered to more than 50 advanced solid tumor and GIST patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, with the vast majority of those patients living with advanced GIST. GIST is a disease frequently driven by KIT mutations, and resistance to currently available therapeutics is frequently associated with the emergence of other KIT mutations. Anti-tumor activity for CGT9486 was observed in both single agent and combination settings, including in combination with sunitinib, an approved treatment option for GIST patients. Clinical data from this trial have been presented at several scientific conferences, including most recently by Cogent at the 2020 annual meeting of the Connective Tissue Oncology Society (CTOS), and previously by Plexxikon Inc. (Plexxikon), a member of the Daiichi Sankyo Group, at the 2018 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the 2017 annual CTOS meeting. Within the group of 15 heavily pre-treated GIST patients who received the combination of CGT9486 and sunitinib, and who had not received prior treatment with CGT9486, the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was twenty percent, including two partial responses and one complete response, while the estimated median progression free survival (mPFS) for this group was twelve months. Four subjects continued to receive CGT9486 via individual patient INDs beyond the conclusion of the trial.
 Worldwide rights to develop and commercialize CGT9486, as well as an additional selective KIT inhibitor, CGT0206, are exclusively licensed from Plexxikon. Under the terms of the license agreement, Plexxikon received an upfront payment and is eligible for additional development and regulatory milestone payments along with mid- to high- single-digit royalty payments.
 We have assembled a management team with extensive experience in the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, specifically including numerous successful precision medicines for genetically defined diseases. With the support of our board of directors and their expertise we believe that the Company is well positioned to develop and commercialize novel precision medicines. Beginning with CGT9486, our mission is to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products that improve the lives of patients fighting rare, genetically driven diseases.
 Our Strategy 
 Our vision is to discover, develop, and commercialize best-in-class therapies that have a meaningful impact for patients with genetically defined diseases. The principal components of our strategy include:

Our Pipeline and Approach
 CGT9486, a potential best-in-class KIT mutant inhibitor, has demonstrated promising clinical activity and safety results in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with GIST, supporting accelerated timelines to proof-of-concept in SM.
 The following figure summarizes our most advanced programs, each of which is described in further detail below: 
 

Subject to feedback from regulatory authorities, we expect to initiate a clinical trial in AdvSM patients during the first half of 2021, followed by the initiation of a clinical trial in Non-AdvSM patients during the second half of 2021. 
 In addition, we are planning FDA discussions to explore further clinical development of CGT9486 in combination with sunitinib in GIST patients, and plan to initiate a clinical study in imatinib-resistant GIST patients during the second half of 2021.
 CGT9486 Overview
 CGT9486, is designed to target mutations found within the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, including KIT D816V. As a Type I inhibitor CGT9486 is designed to selectively bind the active conformation of mutant KIT. We have seen comparable potency observed relative to other FDA-approved KIT mutant inhibitors with potential selectivity advantages.  In preclinical studies of CGT9486 limited blood-brain-barrier penetration was observed, and there have been no clinically significant CNS toxicities identified either preclinically or clinically. The figures below provide a summary of potency and selectivity preclinical data.
 

SM is driven by KIT D816V mutations causing a perpetual ‘on’ state within mast cells, a type of white blood cell, leading to proliferation and accumulation in various internal organs and bone marrow. Also, KIT mutations have been shown as a driver of tumor cell proliferation in patients with advanced GIST. As a highly selective and potent KIT inhibitor, CGT9486 has the potential to provide a new treatment option for patients with both SM and GIST. In addition, CGT9486 has 
 7
 

shown clear selectivity for KIT mutations versus other targets including, but not limited to, wild-type KIT, PDGFRα, VEGFR2, FLT3 and FMS.
 CGT9486 – SM
 SM occurs when mast cells inappropriately accumulate in various internal organs in the body. About 90% of people diagnosed with SM have Non-AdvSM, a life-long illness with chronic symptoms including headaches, urticaria pigmentosa, skin lesions, skin redness and warmth (flushing), abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), that significantly impact the patient’s quality of life. Many patients are also at high risk for severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to various triggers such as insect bites or stings. Patients with AdvSM have a significantly diminished lifespan with a median survival of less than 3.5 years. Patients with Non-AdvSM suffer from a poor quality of life and without any currently approved therapies, are in need of new treatment options. AdvSM is a rare, very aggressive form of SM. Patients with AdvSM may suffer from a multitude of debilitating symptoms such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, ascites, bone fractures, gastrointestinal abnormalities, and enlargement of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, which ultimately lead to organ failure and early death. 
 Based on the characteristics of CGT9486, we are pursuing development of the compound in both patients living with AdvSM and patients with Non-AdvSM, the vast majority of whom have a KIT D816V mutation. Emerging clinical data for other kinase inhibitors with activity against KIT D816V have shown that SM patients are highly sensitive to inhibition of the target. CGT9486 was specifically designed to selectively inhibit KIT mutations, including KIT D816V.
 The underlying SM patient population is not yet well understood. It has been estimated that the prevalence of SM in the United States is between 20,000 to 30,000 patients of which approximately 90% are estimated to have Non-AdvSM.  We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for clinically active, well tolerated treatment options for this patient population. We believe CGT9486 is well suited to meet this need and target the direct underlying cause of SM.
 Subject to feedback from regulatory authorities, we expect to initiate a clinical trial in AdvSM patients during the first half of 2021, followed by the initiation of a clinical trial in Non-AdvSM patients during the second half of 2021. We expect to rapidly assess CGT9486 safety and activity in mastocytosis patients by monitoring well understood and accepted biomarkers, including serum tryptase levels, a marker of disease activity which is elevated in these patients.
 CGT9486 – GIST
 GIST is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in the tissues of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. At diagnosis, about 80% of GIST patients’ tumors are the result of primary KIT mutations. The 5-Year relative survival rate is 83% with currently approved therapies, including imatinib, but the majority of GIST patients eventually develop resistance to these treatments due to secondary KIT mutations, most notably in exon 17 and exon 13. CGT9486 is designed to be a potent and selective inhibitor of KIT exon 17 mutations. By combining CGT9486 with sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor known to inhibit KIT exon 13 mutations, we believe this combination has the potential to offer a new, active treatment option for imatinib resistant GIST patients. 
 The safety profile of CGT9486 has been clinically evaluated in approximately 50 patients both as a single agent and as part of a combination therapy. In November 2020, we presented final results from a Phase 1/2 trial testing the combination of CGT9486 with sunitinib in 18 patients with advanced GIST.  In the subset of 15 patients who had not been previously treated with CGT9486 as a single-agent, the estimated mPFS reached 12 months. These patients had each received several previous treatments, including 10 patients who had received at least three prior lines of therapy. The confirmed ORR was measured at 20 percent, including two partial responses and one complete response. Four subjects continued to receive CGT9486 via individual patient INDs beyond the conclusion of the trial.

Durable Responses in Patients Treated with CGT9486 + Sunitinib

Source: 2020 CTOS annual meeting
 There are an estimated 2,000 to 3,500 patients with imatinib-resistant GIST eligible for treatment each year in the United States. We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for clinically active, well tolerated treatment options for this patient population and CGT9486 is well suited to target the direct underlying cause of GIST.
 Based on these results, we are planning FDA discussions to explore further clinical development of CGT9486 in combination with sunitinib in GIST patients, and plan to initiate a clinical study in imatinib-resistant GIST patients during the second half of 2021.
 Intellectual Property 
 One key to our success will be our ability to establish and maintain protection for our product candidates and know-how, in order to enforce and defend our intellectual property rights and to operate without infringing on the rights of others. We rely on our know-how, trade secrets and continuing technological innovation as well as on in-licensing of third-party 
 9
 

intellectual property to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Our patent portfolio consists of U.S. patents and foreign patents and patent applications that we in-licensed exclusively from Plexxikon.
 With the acquisition of Kiq Bio LLC (formerly Kiq LLC) (Kiq) on July 6, 2020, we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to a patent family owned by Plexxikon pursuant to a license agreement between Plexxikon and Kiq (the License Agreement). The licensed patents and applications under the License Agreement cover CGT9486 and CGT0206, as well as their therapeutic uses.  This patent family includes issued patents in multiple territories, including, but not limited to, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Egypt, Europe (validated in Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, as well as various other EU countries), Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, and the United States. The issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2033 and 2034, and the issued foreign patents are expected to expire in 2033, without consideration of potential patent term extensions. We may seek to obtain rights under additional patent applications relating to CGT9486 and CGT0206 and their use to treat SM and GIST in the United States and in other countries as we proceed with this development program. 
 We are not currently a party and have not been a party to any legal proceedings involving patent rights. 
 In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by trade secret and confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. 
 In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Moreover, we may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property. Disputes regarding ownership or inventorship of our patents or other intellectual property can arise in various contexts, including collaborations and sponsored research. If we are subject to a dispute challenging our rights in or to patents or other intellectual property, such a dispute could be expensive and time consuming. If we are unsuccessful, we could lose valuable rights in intellectual property that we regard as our own.
 For more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section on “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 Licenses and Third-Party Research Collaborations 
 License Agreement with Plexxikon Inc.
 
In July 2020, with the closing of the Kiq acquisition, the Company obtained an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain patents and other intellectual property rights to research, develop, and commercialize CGT9486 and CGT0206. As initial consideration for the license, Kiq directly paid Plexxikon an upfront payment of $1.0 million in cash, which was paid prior to the closing of the Kiq acquisition. Under the terms of the License Agreement, the Company is required to pay Plexxikon aggregate payments of up to $7.5 million upon the satisfaction of certain clinical milestones and up to $25.0 million upon the satisfaction of certain regulatory milestones. 
 The Company is also required to pay Plexxikon tiered royalties ranging from a low-single digit percentage to a high-single digit percentage on annual net sales of products. These royalty obligations last on a product-by-product basis and country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) the date on which there is no valid claim of a licensed Plexxikon patent covering a subject product in such country or (ii) the 10th anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. In addition, if the Company sublicenses the rights under the License Agreement, the Company is required to pay a certain percentage of the sublicense revenue to Plexxikon ranging from mid-double digit percentages to mid-single digit percentages, depending on whether the sublicense is entered into prior to or after certain clinical trial events. 
 10
 

The license agreement will expire on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the later of the last to expire of the patents covering such licensed products or services or the 10-year anniversary of the date of first commercial sale of the licensed product in such country. The Licensors may terminate the license agreement within 30 days after written notice in the event of a breach of contract. The Licensors may also terminate the agreement upon written notice in the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, liquidation, or insolvency. In addition, the Company has the right to terminate this agreement in its entirety at will upon 90 days’ advance written notice to Plexxikon.
 Legacy Collaborations and License Agreements 
 In June 2015, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Seagen Inc., formerly known as Seattle Genetics, (Seagen) (the Collaboration Agreement) to identify, research, develop, and commercialize novel antibody-coupled ACTR therapies incorporating Seagen’s antibodies for the treatment of cancer. On January 16, 2020 (the Termination Effective Date), we and Seagen announced an agreement to terminate the ATTCK-17-01 Phase 1 clinical trial and other research activities under the collaboration (the Termination Agreement). Pursuant to terms of the Termination Agreement, among other things, (i) Seagen paid the Company $5.75 million, (ii) Seagen surrendered, assigned and transferred to Cogent all of its right, title and interest in the 207,961 shares of our common stock owned by Seagen, (iii) we continued to be responsible for and pay all expenses for the wind-down of the ACTR-BCMA trial and (iv) Seagen paid all research and development costs incurred through the Termination Effective Date. In addition, the exclusivity provisions in the Collaboration Agreement terminate and each party will be free to research, develop and commercialize their individual intellectual property (either by themselves or with third parties, subject to the intellectual property rights of the other party. As of December 31, 2020, all clinical studies related to this collaboration have concluded and there are no remaining expenses to be incurred.
 In August 2014, we entered into a license agreement with the National University of Singapore (NUS) and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Inc. that granted us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain patent rights related to our cell therapy platform. On October 14, 2020, the Company provided notice of termination of the license agreement with NUS and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Inc. The termination was effective as of January 12, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we have paid $0.2 million related to the license agreement and there are no remaining expenses to be incurred.
 Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our technology, development experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing drugs and new drugs that may become available in the future.
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other related markets that address precision medicines for patients with genetically defined diseases. There are several other companies working to develop therapies in this field using a similar strategy. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes.
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any drugs that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion 
 11
 

diagnostics, the level of generic competition, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 CGT9486, if approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials, will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs that are currently in development.
 In SM, the only approved drugs for the treatment of AdvSM are imatinib for patients without the KIT D816V mutation or mutational status unknown and Novartis AG’s (Novartis) midostaurin. We may face competition from other drug candidates in pre-clinical or clinical development for SM, including drug candidates from AB Sciences S.A. (ABS), Allakos Inc. (Allakos), Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Deciphera), Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (Celldex) and Blueprint Medicines Corporation (BMC).
 In GIST, the current approved standards of care for unresectable or metastatic patients are first-line imatinib, followed by second-line sunitinib upon imatinib progression, followed by third-line regorafenib upon sunitinib progression, followed by fourth-line ripretinib for patients who have received 3 or more prior kinase inhibitors. In addition, avapritinib was approved by the FDA in January 2020 for patients with GIST harboring a PDGFRα exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations only. We may face competition from other drug candidates in pre-clinical or clinical development including ABS, Allakos, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. (ARIAD), Arog Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Arog), BMC, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), Celldex, Exelixis, Inc. (Exelixis), Deciphera, Ningbo Tai Kang Medical Technology Co. Ltd. (NTKMT), Novartis, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, and Xencor, Inc. (Xencor).
 Manufacturing and Supply
 We do not own or operate, and have no current plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture our drug candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for future commercial supply of any drugs that we may commercialize. To date, we have obtained drug substance and drug product from third-party manufacturers for CGT9486 to support preclinical and clinical testing. We obtain our supplies from these manufacturers on a purchase-order basis and do not have any long-term supply arrangements. We do not currently have a validated manufacturing process in place for any product candidate which would be required to support commercialization of any of our drug candidates, if approved.
 Our drug candidates are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured from readily available starting materials in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes. The manufacturing process is amenable to scale-up. As we continue our clinical development of CGT9486, we expect to continue to enhance our manufacturing process to allow for drug candidates that are safer, more effective, have superior dosing regimens and are cost-effective. 
 We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop.
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, product approval, manufacture, quality control, manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, promotion, advertising, sales, distribution, marketing, and import and export of drugs and biologic products. Our current product candidates are expected to be regulated as drugs. The processes for obtaining regulatory approval in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities both pre- and post-commercialization, are a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our research and development activities and require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
 In the United States, the FDA and other government entities regulate drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in the United States at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as a delay in approving or refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of approvals, delay or suspension of clinical trials, issuance of warning letters and other types of regulatory letters, product recalls, product 
 12
 

seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil monetary penalties, refusals of or debarment from government contracts, exclusion from the federal healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement of profits, civil or criminal investigations by the FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, State Attorneys General, and/or other agencies, False Claims Act suits and/or other litigation, and/or criminal prosecutions.
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug in the United States must typically undertake the following:
  
• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective without FDA objection before human clinical trials may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations, to establish the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product for each indication for which approval is sought;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory review of the NDA by an FDA advisory committee, where applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product, and the active pharmaceutical ingredient or ingredients thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or GMP, regulations and to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees, as applicable, and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, such as any Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, or post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical Studies and an IND
 Preclinical studies can include in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and, in some cases, to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. Other studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity, stability and physical form of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the physical properties, stability and reproducibility of the formulated drug or drug product. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing, such as longer-term toxicity testing, animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may place a clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.

Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.
 Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
 Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites in late-stage clinical trials to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Submission of an NDA to the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently $2.876 million for fiscal year 2021, for applications requiring clinical data, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently $336,432 for fiscal year 2021. These fees are adjusted annually.
 Under certain circumstances, the FDA will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business, defined as a company with less than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, submits for review. An affiliate is defined as a business entity that has a relationship with a second business entity if one business entity controls, or has the power to control, the other business entity, or a third-party controls, or has the power to control, both entities. In addition, an application to market a prescription drug product that has received orphan designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or for which there is no reasonable expectation that U.S. sales will be sufficient to recoup the development and production costs.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th 
 14
 

day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP.
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. After approval, the FDA may seek to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. Some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and approval of NDAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and data demonstrate its potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of Fast Track Designation are the eligibility for priority review, rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval, if relevant criteria are met. The FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or 
 15
 

the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 The FDA may approve an NDA under the accelerated approval program if the drug treats a serious condition, provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies, and demonstrates an effect on either (1) a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or (2) on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.
 In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, established the Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will provide more intensive guidance on the drug development program and expedite its review.
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented.
 FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events or problems with manufacturing processes of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 16
 

 
• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30 Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval.
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Legislative Developments
 The 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, includes provisions to accelerate the development and delivery of new treatments. For example, the Cures Act requires the FDA to establish a program to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help to support the approval of a new indication for an approved drug and to help to support or satisfy post-approval study requirements, to issue guidance on adaptive and novel 
 17
 

clinical trial designs for new drugs, and to establish a process for qualifying drug development tools used to support FDA approval for marketing or investigational use of a drug. The Cures Act also permits the FDA to rely on qualified data summaries to support the approval of a supplemental application for an already approved drug. The FDA is in the process of implementing the Cures Act requirements.
 Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 In order to market any pharmaceutical product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, clinical trials, marketing authorization, packaging, storage, record keeping, reporting, export and import, advertising, marketing and other promotional practices involving pharmaceutical products, as well as commercial sales, distribution, authorization, approval and post-approval monitoring and reporting of our products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a pharmaceutical product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the pharmaceutical product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Drug Development Process
 The conduct of clinical trials is currently governed by the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or the Clinical Trials Directive, pursuant to which a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the EU Member States. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, an applicant must obtain approval in each EU Member State where there is a site at which the clinical trial is to be conducted by two separate entities: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees. The NCAs of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial will be conducted must authorize the conduct of the trial, and the independent Ethics Committee must grant a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the clinical trial in the relevant EU Member State before the commencement of the trial. Any substantial changes to trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be submitted to or approved by the relevant NCA and Ethics Committees. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigational drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and to the Ethics Committees of the EU Member State where they occur. Clinical trial applications, or CTAs, must also be accompanied by an investigational pharmaceutical product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the corresponding national laws of the Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. However, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Clinical Trials Directive in a manner that is not always uniform. This has led to variations in the rules governing the conduct of clinical trials in the individual EU Member States. The EU has, therefore, adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or the Clinical Trials Regulation. The Clinical Trials Regulation, which will repeal the Clinical Trials Directive, introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for pharmaceutical products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The coming into effect of the Clinical Trials Regulation has been postponed several times due to technical difficulties with the underlying IT systems that are still ongoing, but currently the "go live" of these systems and, accordingly, the coming into force of the regulation, is planned for December 2021.
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union, in particular through a harmonized electronic submission and assessment process for clinical trials conducted in multiple EU Member States. For example, the sponsor will be able to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial through a centralized EU clinical trials information system. As part of the application process, the sponsor proposes a reporting EU Member State, which will take the lead in validating and evaluating the application. The reporting EU Member State consults and coordinates with the other concerned EU Member States. If an application is rejected, it may be amended and resubmitted through the EU clinical trials information system. If an approval is issued, the sponsor may start the clinical trial in all concerned EU Member States. However, a concerned EU Member State may in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in that EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting and introduces enhanced transparency 
 18
 

requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU database. Information stored in the EU database will be made publicly available subject to transparency rules.
 Under both the current regime and the new Clinical Trials Regulation, national laws, regulations, and the applicable Good Clinical Practice and Good Laboratory Practice standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials, including the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 During the development of a pharmaceutical product, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and national regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, on the recommendation of the Scientific Advice Working Party, or SAWP. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure, but is significantly reduced for designated orphan medicines. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, of the product concerned.
 Marketing Authorization Procedures
 In the EU and in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein (together, the European Economic Area or EEA), after completion of all required clinical testing, pharmaceutical products may only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. To obtain an MA of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant can submit an MAA through, amongst others, a centralized or decentralized procedure.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all EU Member States and, after respective national implementing decisions, in the three additional member states of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein). The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific pharmaceutical products, including for medicines developed by means of certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan pharmaceutical products, advanced therapy pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases (AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto- immune and viral diseases). For pharmaceutical products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the European Economic Area before May 20, 2004 and indicated for the treatment of other diseases, pharmaceutical products that constitute significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovations or for which the grant of a marketing authorization through the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health at EU level, an applicant may voluntarily submit an application for a marketing authorization through the centralized procedure.
 Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure, the timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA’s CHMP is, in principle, 210 days from receipt of a valid MAA. However, this timeline excludes clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP, so the overall process typically takes a year or more unless the application is eligible for an accelerated assessment. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases when a pharmaceutical product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. On request, the CHMP can reduce the time frame to 150 days if the applicant provides sufficient justification for an accelerated assessment. The CHMP will provide a positive opinion regarding the application only if it meets certain quality, safety and efficacy requirements. However, the European Commission has the final authority for granting the MA within 67 days after receipt of the CHMP opinion. 
 The decentralized procedure permits companies to file identical MA applications for a pharmaceutical product to the competent authorities in various EU Member States simultaneously if such pharmaceutical product has not received marketing approval in any EU Member State before. This procedure is available for pharmaceutical products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, EU Member States of an assessment of an application performed by one-member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference EU Member State. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference EU Member State and concerned EU Member States. The reference EU Member State prepares a 
 19
 

draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference EU Member State’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned EU Member State must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
 If a Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.
 All new MAAs must include a Risk Management Plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. RMPs and Periodic Safety Update Reports, or PSURs, are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.
 Marketing Authorizations have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may subsequently be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the European Commission or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with only one additional five-year renewal. Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires.
 Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
 As in the United States, it may be possible to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity in the European Union that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic, hybrid or biosimilar product (even if the pharmaceutical product has already received an MA) and prohibiting another applicant from relying on the MA holder’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data in support of another MA for the purposes of submitting an application, obtaining MA or placing the product on the market. In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first MA in the European Union. After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the MA holder’s data. However, a generic product cannot launch until two years later (or a total of 10 years after the first MA in the EU of the innovator product), or three years later (or a total of 11 years after the first MA in the EU of the innovator product) if the MA holder obtains MA for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the eight-year data exclusivity period. Additionally, another noncumulative one year period of data exclusivity can be added to the eight years of data exclusivity where an application is made for a new indication for a well-established substance, provided that significant pre-clinical or clinical studies were carried out in relation to the new indication. Another year of data exclusivity may be added to the eight years, where a change of classification of a pharmaceutical product has been authorized on the basis of significant pre-trial tests or clinical trials (when examining an application by another applicant for or holder of market authorization for a change of classification of the same substance the competent authority will not refer to the results of those tests or trials for one year after the initial change was authorized).
 Products may not be granted data exclusivity since there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to include a new chemical entity. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with their own complete database of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its pharmaceutical product.
 20
 

Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. The EMA grants orphan drug designation if the medicinal product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union (prevalence criterion). In addition, Orphan Drug Designation can be granted if, for economic reasons, the medicinal product would be unlikely to be developed without incentives and if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing, or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed medicinal product is a significant benefit to patients affected by the condition. An application for orphan drug designation (which is not a marketing authorization, as not all orphan-designated medicines reach the authorization application stage) must be submitted first before an application for marketing authorization of the medicinal product is submitted. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted, and sponsors must submit an annual report to EMA summarizing the status of development of the medicine. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Designated orphan medicines are eligible for conditional marketing authorization. 
 The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products reassesses the orphan drug designation of a product in parallel with the review for a marketing authorization; for a product to benefit from market exclusivity it must maintain its orphan drug designation at the time of marketing authorization review by the EMA and approval by the EC. Additionally, any marketing authorization granted for an orphan medicinal product must only cover the therapeutic indication(s) that are covered by the orphan drug designation. Upon the grant of a marketing authorization, orphan drug designation provides up to ten years of market exclusivity in the orphan indication.
 During the 10-year period of market exclusivity, with a limited number of exceptions, the regulatory authorities of the EU Member States and the EMA may not accept applications for marketing authorization, accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorization or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products for the same therapeutic indication. A similar medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan medicinal product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity for an orphan-designated condition when the results of specific studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, addressing the pediatric population and completed in accordance with a fully compliant Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
 The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, i.e. the condition prevalence or financial returns criteria under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. When the period of orphan market exclusivity for an indication ends, the orphan drug designation for that indication expires as well. Orphan exclusivity runs in parallel with normal rules on data exclusivity and market protection. Additionally, a marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product (orphan or not) for the same or overlapping indication subject to certain requirements. 
 Pediatric Development
 In the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product are obligated to study their product in children and must therefore submit a PIP together with a request for agreement to the EMA. The EMA issues a decision on the PIP based on an opinion of the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. Companies must conduct pediatric clinical trials in compliance with the PIP approved by the EMA, unless a deferral (e.g., until enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults is available) or waiver (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults) has been granted by the EMA. The marketing authorization application for the product must include the results of all pediatric clinical trials performed and details of all information collected in compliance with the approved PIP, unless a waiver or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials may be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the approved PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the approved PIP are developed and submitted. An approved PIP is also required when a marketing-authorization holder wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights.
 21
 

Post-Approval Regulation
 Similar to the United States, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing licenses and marketing authorizations. It includes control of compliance with EU good manufacturing practices rules, manufacturing authorizations, pharmacovigilance rules and requirements governing advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution, recordkeeping, importing and exporting of pharmaceutical products.
 Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to comply with EU laws and the EU Member State laws implementing Directive 2001/83/EC on pharmaceutical products for human use and other core legislation relating to pharmaceutical products, and other EU Member State laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, exclusions from tenders, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a pharmaceutical product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of pharmaceutical products.
 These pharmacovigilance rules can impose on holders of marketing authorizations the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed pharmaceutical products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies or post-authorization safety studies to obtain further information on a medicine’s safety, or to measure the effectiveness of risk-management measures, which may be time consuming and expensive and could impact our profitability. Marketing authorization holders must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of PSURs in relation to pharmaceutical products for which they hold marketing authorizations The EMA reviews PSURs for pharmaceutical products authorized through the centralized procedure. If the EMA has concerns that the risk-benefit profile of a product has varied, it can adopt an opinion advising that the existing marketing authorization for the product be suspended, withdrawn or varied. The EMA can advise that the marketing authorization holder be obliged to conduct post-authorization Phase 4 safety studies. The EMA opinion is submitted to the European Commission for its consideration. If the Commission agrees with the opinion, it can adopt a decision varying the existing marketing authorization. Failure by the marketing authorization holder to fulfill the obligations for which the European Commission’s decision provides can undermine the on-going validity of the marketing authorization.
 More generally, non-compliance with pharmacovigilance obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the marketing authorization for the pharmaceutical product or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.
 The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products in the European Union is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP. These requirements include compliance with EU GMP standards when manufacturing pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union.
 Similarly, the distribution of pharmaceutical products into and within the European Union is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. The manufacturer or importer must have a qualified person who is responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured in accordance with GMP, before releasing the product for commercial distribution in the European Union or for use in a clinical trial. Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the competent authorities for compliance with GMP.
 22
 

Advertising and Promotion
 The advertising and promotion of our products is also subject to EU laws concerning promotion of pharmaceutical products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other national legislation of individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and may differ from one country to another. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to pharmaceutical products comply with the product’s SmPC as approved by the competent regulatory authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the pharmaceutical product. It forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the pharmaceutical product. Promotion of a pharmaceutical product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved SmPC and therefore all off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products is prohibited in the European Union. The applicable laws at the EU level and in the individual EU Member States also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only pharmaceutical products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of pharmaceutical products in the European Union could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on its promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Pricing and Reimbursement Environment
 Even if a pharmaceutical product obtains a marketing authorization in the European Union, there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such product will be secured on a timely basis or at all. The EU Member States are free to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and reimbursement levels of pharmaceutical products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the pharmaceutical product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms.
 Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, if any, to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, pharmaceutical products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally published and actual prices tend to be significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third party payers or authorities and public tenders may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.
 The so-called health technology assessment, or HTA, of pharmaceutical products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact, and the economic and societal impact of use of a given pharmaceutical product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost- effectiveness of individual pharmaceutical products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of pharmaceutical products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific pharmaceutical products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to pharmaceutical products by the regulatory authorities of individual EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of our products by a leading and recognized HTA body could not only undermine our ability to obtain reimbursement for such product in the EU Member State in which such negative assessment was issued, but also in other EU Member States. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms could rely to some extent on the HTA performed in other countries with a developed HTA framework, when adopting decisions concerning the pricing and reimbursement of a specific pharmaceutical product.
 On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on health technology assessment. This legislative proposal is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new pharmaceutical products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The proposal provides that EU Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies and procedures across the European Union, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the 
 23
 

innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. The European Commission has stated that the role of the draft HTA regulation is not to influence pricing and reimbursement decisions in the individual EU Member States, but there can be no assurance that the draft HTA regulation will not have effects on pricing and reimbursement decisions if and when the draft HTA regulation comes into force.
 To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, including the EU Member States, we may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care. There can be no assurance that any country will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of our products, or that we will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.
 In certain of the EU Member States, pharmaceutical products that are designated as orphan pharmaceutical products may be exempted or waived from having to provide certain clinical, cost-effectiveness and other economic data in connection with their filings for pricing/reimbursement approval.
 European Data Laws
 The collection and use of personal health data and other personal information in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679), or GDPR, which came into force in May 2018 and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States. 
 The GDPR imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to process (processing includes collection, analysis and transfer of) personal data of individuals within the European Union and in the EEA, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. Member States may also impose additional requirements in relation to health, genetic and biometric data through their national implementing legislation.
 The GDPR also prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Union that are not considered by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of data protection, except if the data controller or processor meets very specific requirements such as the use of standard contractual clauses, or SCC, issued by the EU Commission. In this respect recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from the EEA. For example, following the Schrems II decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union on July 16, 2020, in which the Court invalidated the Privacy Shield under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to United States entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme, there is uncertainty as to the general permissibility of international data transfers under the GDPR. In light of the implications of this decision we may face difficulties regarding the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the European Union. The European Data Protection Board has adopted draft recommendations for data controllers and processors who export personal data to third countries regarding supplementary measures to ensure compliance with the GDPR when transferring personal data outside of the European Union. These recommendations were submitted to public consultation until December 21, 2020, however it is unclear when and in which form these recommendations will be published in final form. Moreover, it is uncertain whether the SCC will also be invalidated by the European courts or legislature. Also in light of this uncertainty, the EU Commission has published a draft implementing decision on new SCC that, however, has not yet been officially adopted.
 Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, other administrative penalties and a number of criminal offenses (punishable by uncapped fines) for organizations and in certain cases their directors and officers as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still implement certain variations, enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the European Union. Guidance developed at both EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States and the United Kingdom concerning implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
 24
 

There is, moreover, a growing trend towards required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the European Union which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or Clinical Trials Regulation, EMA disclosure initiatives and voluntary commitments by industry. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, harm to our reputation, and adversely impact our business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks, such as the Clinical Trials Regulation and the GDPR, further adds to the complexity that we face with regard to data protection regulation.
 On December 24, 2020 the EU and the UK reached agreement on the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement that with respect to data protection provides for a further transition period of up to six months as of January 1, 2021 to enable the European Commission to complete its adequacy assessment of the UK’s data protection laws. Accordingly, personal data may continue to be transferred freely between the EU and UK during that specified period. If no adequacy decision has been adopted by the EU Commission during such period, or if the UK makes changes to its data protection legal framework that is in place as of January 1, 2021 without the EU's consent, the transfer of personal data from the EU to the UK will only be permissible if EU data exporters take further steps to ensure adequacy for the protection of personal data, which may expose us to further compliance risk. Additionally, following the UK's withdrawal from the European Union and the EEA, companies have to comply also with the UK’s data protection laws (including the GDPR as incorporated into UK national law), the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover.
 Promotional Activities
 In the European Union, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct both at EU level and in the individual EU Member States (at a national or regional level). The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of pharmaceutical products is prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
 Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her regulatory professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual EU Member States (at a national or regional level). Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, exclusion from public tenders, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
 While the UK has left the EU, as mentioned above, it should be noted that the UK still has the strictest anti-bribery regime in Europe, the UK Bribery Act 2010. The Act is applicable English law and continues to apply to any company incorporated in or “carrying on business” in the United Kingdom, irrespective of where in the world the alleged bribery activity occurs.
 Other Legislation Regarding Marketing, Authorization and Pricing of Pharmaceutical Products in the European Union
  Other core legislation relating to the marketing, authorization and pricing of pharmaceutical products in the European Union includes the following:
  
• | Directive 2001/83/EC, establishing the requirements and procedures governing the marketing authorization for medicinal products for human use, as well as the rules for the constant supervision of products following authorization. This Directive has been amended several times, most recently by Directive 2012/26/EU regarding pharmacovigilance, and the Falsified Medicines Directive 2011/62/EU.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulation (EC) 726/2004, as amended, establishing procedures for the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing the EMA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulation (EC) 469/2009, establishing the requirements necessary to obtain a Supplementary Protection Certificate, which extends the period of patent protection applicable to medicinal products at the EU-level.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 25
 

 
• | Directive 89/105/EEC, ensuring the transparency of measures taken by the European Union member states to set the prices and reimbursements of medicinal products. Specifically, while each member state has competence over the pricing and reimbursement of medicines for human use, they must also comply with this Directive, which establishes procedures to ensure that member state decisions and policies do not obstruct trade in medicinal products. The European Commission proposed to repeal and replace Directive 89/105/EEC, but this proposal was withdrawn in 2015.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Directive 2003/94/EC, laying down the principles of good manufacturing practice in respect of medicinal products and investigational medicinal products for human use (the GMP Directive).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Directive 2005/28/EC of April 8 2005, laying down principles and detailed guidelines for good clinical practice as regards investigational medicinal products for human use, as well as the requirements for authorization of the manufacturing or importation of such products” (the GCP Directive).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the European Union, its member states and other states of Europe that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, marketing, coverage and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. In addition to new legislation, pharmaceutical regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the EMA and national agencies in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products.
 Since the United Kingdom, or UK, has formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 and the transition period, during which EU laws continued to apply to the United Kingdom, has expired on December 31, 2020, EU laws now only apply to the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland as laid out in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. The EU and the United Kingdom have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was ratified by the UK Parliament on December 30, 2020. The TCA is provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and it is currently awaiting ratification by the European Parliament and the European Council which is expected by the end of April 2021 (being the current expiration date of the provisional application period of the TCA).
 The TCA includes provisions affecting the life sciences sector (including on customs and tariffs) but areas for further discussion between the EU and UK remain. In addition, there are some specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals. These include the mutual recognition of Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued. The TCA does not, however, contain wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations and product standards.
 Since January 1, 2021, the EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained EU law”. As there is no general power to amend these regulations, the UK government has adopted the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 which seeks to address this regulatory gap through introducing regulation-making, delegated powers covering the fields of human medicines, clinical trials of human medicines, veterinary medicines and medical devices. The purpose of the act is to enable the existing regulatory frameworks to be updated, with the powers granted under it only exercisable in relation to four pieces of legislation: the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, the Medicines (Products for Human Use) Regulations 2016 and limited parts of the Medicines Act 1968 (specifically those parts which make provision related to pharmacies). It is then further restricted to amending or updating only those provisions stated in the act, which include clinical trials. 
 Specified provisions of the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 entered into force on February 11, 2021 when the legislation formally became law. The remaining provisions will come into effect within two months of February 11, 2021 or otherwise as stipulated in subsequent statutory instruments.
 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as, in the United States, Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or 
 26
 

formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost- effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not necessarily imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs, which may impact physician utilization.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, risk sharing, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals. As a result, the marketability of any product which receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.
 In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and the U.S. Supreme Court heard a case on the constitutionality of the ACA and a decision is expected by the Spring of 2021. It is unclear how this decision and other efforts to repeal, replace or otherwise modify the ACA will impact the law on reimbursement. We cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, particularly as a result of the recent presidential election, or how any future legislation or regulation may affect us. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products that receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, third-
 27
 

party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:
  
• | the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration (in cash or in kind), directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any item, facility or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Additionally, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits, among other things, U.S. corporations and persons acting on their behalf from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official (including certain healthcare professionals in many countries), political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or otherwise seek preferential treatment abroad;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act, which may be enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice or private whistleblowers to bring civil actions (qui tam actions) on behalf of the federal government, imposes civil penalties, as well as liability for treble damages and for attorneys’ fees and costs, on individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, making a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Department of Health and Human Services’ Civil Monetary Penalties authorities, which imposes administrative sanctions for, among other things, presenting or causing to be presented false claims for government payment and providing remuneration to government health program beneficiaries to influence them to order or receive healthcare items or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other conduct, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes criminal and civil liability and penalties on those who violate requirements, including mandatory contractual terms, intended to safeguard the privacy, security, transmission and use of individually identifiable health information;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute relating to healthcare matters prohibits falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs (among other products) to report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (as defined by statute) and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the reporting manufacturers. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report payments and other transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | similar state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 28
 

 
• | certain state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with voluntary compliance guidelines promulgated by a pharmaceutical industry association and relevant compliance guidance issues by HHS Office of Inspector General; bar drug manufacturers from offering or providing certain types of payments or gifts to physicians and other health care providers; and/or require disclosure of gifts or payments to physicians and other healthcare providers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Various state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances; many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violation of any of these laws or any other current or future governmental laws and regulations that may apply to drug manufacturers include significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if the manufacturer becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, any of which could substantially disrupt its operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.
 Additional Regulation 
 In addition to the foregoing, state, and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling, and disposal of various biologic, chemical, and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in third countries that impose similar obligations. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 15 full time employees, approximately 60% of whom have an M.D., Ph.D., or other advanced degree. Our employees are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Boulder, Colorado. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
Facilities 
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where we lease approximately 33,500 square feet of office and laboratory space pursuant to a lease agreement commencing in July 2015 and expiring in April 2023. This facility houses our clinical, regulatory, commercial, and administrative personnel. We sublease approximately 70% space under the terms of our sublease agreement.
Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings.

Corporate History 
 We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in March 2014 under the name Unum Therapeutics Inc. On April 3, 2018, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of our common stock under the ticker “UMRX.”  On October 2, 2020, we filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to change our name from Unum Therapeutics Inc. to Cogent Biosciences, Inc. The name change became effective on October 6, 2020. In connection with the name change, our common stock began trading under the ticker symbol “COGT.” 
 On March 19, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement (the LPC Purchase Agreement) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (LPC), pursuant to which we may elect to sell to LPC up to $25.0 million in shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the LPC Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the LPC Purchase Agreement, we issued 181,595 shares of common stock to LPC as a commitment fee. As of December 31, 2020, 2,412,870 registered common shares have been sold to LPC under the LPC Purchase Agreement for proceeds of $25.0 million. No additional shares may be sold to LPC under the LPC Purchase Agreement.
 On March 26, 2020, we announced that we would be exploring strategic alternatives in order to maximize stockholder value and that we had engaged Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. to act as our strategic financial advisor to assist in the strategic review process. As of July 6, 2020, we successfully signed and closed the acquisition of Kiq.
 On July 6, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Kiq, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated July 6, 2020 (the Merger Agreement).
 On July 9, 2020, we completed a Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) with existing and new investors to raise gross proceeds of $104.4 million, or net proceeds of $98.9 million, after deducting commissions and offering costs, in which the investors were issued shares of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock) at a price of $880 per share or, $3.52 per share on an as-converted-to-common basis. 
 On August 28, 2020, we completed the sale of our BOXR technology and Autologous Cell Therapy Industrial Automation (ACTIA) technology (collectively, the BOXR Platform), to Sotio LLC (Sotio) (the BOXR Platform Transaction), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement by and among Cogent, Sotio and Sotio NV as Guarantor (the BOXR Platform Purchase Agreement).
 In August 2020, our board of directors unanimously approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation, which would allow the board to effect a reverse stock split of all issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, at a ratio ranging from 1-for-4 to 1-for-8, inclusive, subject to stockholder approval. On October 9, 2020, the Company filed a Definitive Proxy Statement which included the proposal that our stockholders approve the amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effect the reverse stock split and a proposal that the stockholders approve the conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued in the Kiq acquisition and the PIPE. The proposals were approved by the stockholders at a special meeting held on November 6, 2020 and our board of directors approved a ratio of 1-for-4 for the reverse stock split.  The amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effect the reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-4 was filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on November 6, 2020.
 On December 4, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,794,872 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $9.75 per share. This included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 30-day option to purchase up to 1,538,461 additional shares of common stock. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, were approximately $107.7 million.
 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 
 We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (JOBS Act). As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 

• | only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;

 We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company on the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these exemptions. We have taken advantage of the reduced reporting requirements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. 
 We have irrevocably elected to “opt out” of the exemption for the delayed adoption of certain accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
