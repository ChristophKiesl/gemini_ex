The remaining 16% of our 2016 sales were primarily to Tier I and Tier II automotive suppliers, non-automotive manufacturers, and replacement market distributors. The Company’s products can be found on over 450 nameplates globally. 
Corporate History and Business Developments
Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. was established in 2004 as a Delaware corporation and began operating on December 23, 2004 when it acquired the automotive segment of Cooper Tire & Rubber Company (the “2004 Acquisition”). Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. operates the business primarily through its principal operating subsidiary, Cooper-Standard Automotive Inc. (“CSA U.S.”). Since the 2004 Acquisition, the Company has expanded and diversified its customer base through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.
In August 2009, following the onset of the financial crisis and economic downturn that severely impacted the global automotive industry, Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in the United States and Canada commenced reorganization proceedings in the United States (the “Chapter 11 proceedings”) and Canada. In May 2010, the Company consummated its reorganization pursuant to a court-confirmed plan of reorganization and emerged from the Chapter 11 proceedings and the Canadian proceedings.
From 2006 to 2013, the Company accelerated its growth through a number of strategic acquisitions including the Fluid Handling Systems Operations in North America, Europe and China (collectively, “FHS”) from ITT Industries, Inc.; Metzeler Automotive Profile Systems; a hose manufacturing operation in Mexico from the Gates Corporation; USi, Inc.; the sealing business of Sigit S.p.A.; a joint venture with Fonds de Modernisation des Equipementiers Automobiles (“FMEA”); and Jyco Sealing Technology.
In October 2013, Cooper Standard’s common stock was listed on the NYSE and began trading under the ticker symbol “CPS.” Prior to the NYSE listing, the Company’s common stock was traded on the Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) Bulletin Board under the symbol “COSH.”
We continued strategic acquisitions and partnerships in 2014 and 2015 with the acquisition of Cikautxo Borja, S.L.U. in Spain, a manufacturer of heating and cooling hoses; the purchase of an additional 47.5% of Huayu-Cooper Standard Sealing Systems Co. (“Shenya”), increasing our equity ownership to 95% and positioning the Company as a leader in sealing systems in the Chinese automotive market; the formation of a joint venture with Polyrub Extrusions (India) Private Limited to grow the 
3

Company’s fluid transfer systems business in Asia; and a joint venture with INOAC Corporation of Japan accelerating our fluid transfer systems strategy in Asia. In 2016, we acquired the North American fuel and brake business of AMI Industries to expand the Company’s fuel and brake business. We also gained control of our China-based joint venture, Shenya Sealing (Guangzhou) Company Limited. 
In 2014 and 2015, the Company divested its thermal and emissions product line and hard coat plastic exterior trim business, respectively, to focus on the product lines where Cooper Standard holds leading market positions. 
Business Strategy
In 2013, we set a clear vision for achieving profitable growth with a mission to become a Top 30 automotive supplier in terms of sales and top 5 in ROIC (return on invested capital). 
In 2016, the leadership team refined this vision: Driving Value Through Culture, Innovation and Results to more closely represent the evolution of the Company’s culture and to provide the basis for delivering even greater value. The global leadership team also reshaped the supporting pillars in 2016 to align with the progress of the Company. These pillars are:

Voice of the Customer: | We design and develop our products to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We listen intently and adjust to customer feedback to ensure we are consistently providing customer-focused products while meeting their evolving needs. Cooper Standard is dedicated to serving its global customers and the automotive industry as a whole.

Leverage Technology for Innovative Solutions
We utilize our technical expertise to provide customers with innovative solutions. Our engineers combine product design with a broad understanding of material characteristics for enhanced vehicle performance. We believe our reputation for successful innovation in product design and materials is the reason our customers consult us early in their vehicle development and design process of their next generation vehicles.
In 2016, Cooper Standard was recognized by Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE®) with the Automotive Innovation Award for the co-development of Cooper Standard’s High Performance Vacuum Brake Tube design with Royal DSM. This technology was created to replace traditional clamped rubber hoses, to simplify engine and undercarriage routing. The design offers significant space and weight savings while allowing for rapid assembly and ease of maintenance through the use of quick connectors.
Cooper Standard has evolved and further energized its approach to innovation with its i3 Innovation Process (Imagine, Initiate, Innovate). This approach is used as a mechanism to capture ideas from across our Company and supply partners while promoting a culture of innovation.
Ideas are carefully evaluated by a global technology council and those that are selected are put on an accelerated development cycle with a dedicated innovation team focused on breakthrough ideas. This team is developing game-changing technologies based on materials expertise, process know-how, and application vision, which may drive future product direction. Among recently announced technologies is ArmorHose™, a breakthrough technology which results in significantly more durable coolant hoses and eliminates the need for separate abrasion sleeves on under-hood hose assemblies. Several other significant technologies, especially related to advanced materials, processing and weight reduction, have recently been realized. These include: Fortrex™, a revolutionary material that provides higher performance and lower weight to weather seals; and MagAlloy™, a new processing technology for brake lines that increases long term durability through superior corrosion resistance.
Continued Emphasis on Global Platforms
We believe global platforms, which require the same design, quality and delivery standards globally, will drive increased growth for capable global suppliers. It is predicted that the top ten global platforms produced by automakers will account for about 30% of the world’s light vehicle volume by 2022, highlighting the importance of being well-positioned to participate in these high-volume, global programs. Based on our 2016 revenue, six of the top ten vehicle platforms on which we provide content are global platforms, which demonstrates that customers already look to us to support global platforms. Our global presence and technological capabilities ideally position us to continue to win business on global platforms.
Pursue Acquisitions and Alliances to Enhance Capabilities and Accelerate Growth
We intend to continue to selectively pursue complementary acquisitions and joint ventures to enhance our customer base, geographic penetration, scale and technology. Consolidation is an industry trend and is encouraged by the OEM’s desire for global automotive suppliers. We believe we have a strong platform for growth through acquisitions based on our past integration successes, experienced management team, global presence and operational excellence. Further, our operations currently include several successful joint ventures. 
Industry
The automotive industry is one of the world’s largest and most competitive. Consumer demand for new vehicles largely determines sales and production volumes of global OEMs. Automotive suppliers gain market share by winning new platforms and by increasing their content per vehicle within these platforms.
The automotive supplier industry is generally characterized by high barriers to entry, significant start-up costs and long-standing customer relationships. The criteria by which OEMs judge automotive suppliers include quality, price, service, performance, design and engineering capabilities, innovation, timely delivery, financial stability and global footprint. Over the last decade, suppliers that have been able to achieve manufacturing scale, reduce structural costs, diversify their customer base and establish a global manufacturing footprint have been successful.
Markets Served
Our focus is on the passenger car and light truck market, up to and including Class 3 Full Size Frame trucks, better known as the light vehicle market. This is our largest market and accounts for approximately 96% of our global sales.

Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances
Joint ventures represent an important part of our business, both operationally and strategically. We have utilized joint ventures to enter into new geographic markets such as China, India and Thailand, to acquire new customers and to develop new technologies. When entering new geographic markets, teaming with a local partner can reduce capital investment by leveraging pre-existing infrastructure. In addition, local partners in these markets can provide knowledge and insight into local practices and access to local suppliers of raw materials and components.
The following table shows our significant unconsolidated joint ventures:

Country | Name | Ownership Percentage
India | Sujan Cooper Standard AVS Private Limited | 50%

Intellectual Property
We believe that one of our key competitive advantages is our ability to translate customer needs and our game-changing ideas into innovation through the development of intellectual property. We hold a significant number of patents and trademarks worldwide. 
Our patents are grouped into two major categories: (1) specific product invention claims and (2) specific manufacturing processes that are used for producing products. The vast majority of our patents fall within the product invention category. We consider these patents to be of value and seek to protect our rights throughout the world against infringement. While in the aggregate these patents are important to our business, we do not believe that the loss or expiration of any one patent would materially affect our Company. We continue to seek patent protection for our new products and have an incentive program to recognize employees whose inventions are patented. Additionally, we develop significant technologies that we treat as trade secrets and choose not to disclose to the public through the patent process, but which nonetheless provide significant competitive advantages and contribute to our global leadership position in various markets. We believe that our trademarks, including ArmorHose™, Ultra Pro Coat™, MagAlloy™ and Fortrex™, help differentiate us and lead customers to seek our partnership. 
We also have technology sharing and licensing agreements with various third parties, including Nishikawa Rubber Company, one of our joint venture partners in sealing products. We have mutual agreements with Nishikawa Rubber Company for sales, marketing and engineering services on certain sealing products. Under those agreements, each party pays for services provided by the other and royalties on certain products for which the other party provides design or development services.
Supplies and Raw Materials
Cooper Standard is committed to building strong relationships with our supply partners. We recognize the importance of engaging with suppliers to create value for our customers.
The principal raw materials for our business include ethylene propylene diene monomer M-Class rubber (“EPDM”) and synthetic rubber, components manufactured from carbon steel, plastic resins and components, carbon black, process oils, components manufactured from aluminum and natural rubber. We manage the procurement of our raw materials to assure supply and to obtain the most favorable total cost of ownership. Procurement arrangements include short-term and long-term supply agreements that may contain formula-based pricing based on commodity indices. These arrangements provide quantities needed to satisfy normal manufacturing demands. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our products with suppliers located around the world. We often use offshore suppliers for machined components, die castings and other labor-intensive, economically freighted products in our North American and European facilities.
Raw material prices are subject to fluctuations and we have implemented strategies with both our suppliers and our customers to help manage these fluctuations. These actions include material substitutions and leveraging global purchases. Global supply chain optimization includes using benchmarks and selective sourcing from strategic suppliers. We have also made process improvements to ensure the efficient use of materials through scrap reduction, as well as standardization of material specifications to maximize leverage over higher volume purchases. With some customers, on certain raw materials, we have implemented indices that allow price changes as underlying material costs fluctuate.
Geographic Information
See Note 19. “Business Segments” to the consolidated financial statements for geographic information.
Seasonality
Historically, sales to OEMs are lowest during the months prior to model changeovers and during assembly plant shutdowns. However, economic conditions and consumer demand may change the traditional seasonality of the industry and lower production may result without the impact of seasonality. In the past, model changeover periods have typically resulted in lower sales volumes during July, August and December. During these periods of lower sales volumes, profits may decline but working capital often improves due to the continued collection of accounts receivable.
Backlog
Our OEM sales are generally based upon purchase orders issued by the OEMs, with updated releases for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of orders at any point in time. Once selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally three to five years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform.

Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 30,000 full-time and temporary employees. We maintain good relations with both our union and non-union employees, and, in the past ten years, have not experienced any major work stoppages. We have renegotiated some of our domestic and non-domestic union agreements in 2016, and have several contracts set to expire in the next twelve months. 
Environmental
We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations in the United States and other countries, including regulations governing: emissions to air, discharges to water, noise and odor emissions; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, reclamation and disposal of chemicals and waste materials; the cleanup of contaminated properties; and human health and safety. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. While our costs to defend and settle known claims arising under environmental laws are not currently estimated to be material, such costs may be material in the future.
