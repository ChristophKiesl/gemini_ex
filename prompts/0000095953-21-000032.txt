Item 1. Business
Synalloy Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1958 as the successor to a chemical manufacturing business founded in 1945. Its charter is perpetual. The name was changed on July 31, 1967 from Blackman Uhler Industries, Inc. The Company's executive office is located at 4510 Cox Road, Suite 201, Richmond, Virginia 23060. Unless indicated otherwise, the terms "Synalloy", "Company," "we" "us," and "our" refer to Synalloy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
The Company's business is divided into two reportable operating segments, the Metals Segment and the Specialty Chemicals Segment. The Metals Segment operates as three reporting units, all International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") certified manufacturers, including Welded Pipe & Tube Operations, a unit that includes Bristol Metals, LLC ("BRISMET") and American Stainless Tubing, LLC ("ASTI"), which began operations effective January 1, 2019 pursuant to our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of American Stainless Tubing, Inc. ("American Stainless") (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), Palmer of Texas Tanks, Inc. ("Palmer"), and Specialty Pipe & Tube, Inc. ("Specialty"). Welded Pipe & Tube Operations manufactures stainless steel, galvanized, ornamental stainless steel pipe and tube, and other alloy pipe and tube. Palmer manufactures liquid storage solutions and separation equipment. Specialty is a master distributor of seamless carbon pipe and tube. The Metals Segment serves markets through the master distribution of pipe and tube and customers in the appliance, architectural, automotive and commercial transportation, brewery, chemical, petrochemical, pulp and paper, mining, power generation (including nuclear), water and waste-water treatment, liquid natural gas ("LNG"), food processing, pharmaceutical, oil and gas and other heavy industries. The Specialty Chemicals Segment operates as one reporting unit which includes Manufacturers Chemicals, LLC ("MC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manufacturers Soap and Chemical Company ("MS&C"), and CRI Tolling, LLC ("CRI Tolling"). MC manufactures lubricants, surfactants, defoamers, reaction intermediaries and sulfated fats and oils. CRI Tolling provides chemical tolling manufacturing resources to global and regional chemical companies and contracts with other chemical companies to manufacture certain, pre-defined products. The Specialty Chemicals Segment produces specialty chemicals for the chemical, pulp and paper, coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomers (CASE), textile, automotive, household, industrial and institutional, water and waste-water treatment, construction, oil and gas and other industries.
General
Metals Segment – The segment is comprised of four wholly-owned subsidiaries: Synalloy Metals, Inc., which owns 100 percent of the membership interests of BRISMET, located in Bristol, Tennessee and Munhall, Pennsylvania; ASTI, located in Troutman and Statesville, North Carolina; Palmer, located in Andrews, Texas; and Specialty, located in Mineral Ridge, Ohio and Houston, Texas. Two subsidiaries, BRISMET and ASTI, are aggregated as one reporting unit called Welded Pipe and Tube Operations, with Palmer and Specialty making up the segment's other two reporting units.
BRISMET manufactures welded pipe and tube, primarily from stainless steel, duplex, and nickel alloys. Pipe is produced in sizes from 3/8 inch outside diameter to 144 inches outside diameter and inner dimension wall thickness from 0.28 inches up to 1 and 3/8 inches. Pipe smaller than 18 inches in diameter is made on equipment that forms and welds the pipe in a continuous process. Pipe larger than 18 inches in diameter is formed on presses or rolls and welded on batch welding equipment. Pipe is normally produced in standard 20-foot lengths. BRISMET also has capabilities in the production of long length pipe without circumferential welds. This can reduce the installation cost for the customer. Lengths up to 60 feet can be produced in sizes up to 18 inches in diameter. In larger sizes, BRISMET has a unique ability among domestic producers to make 48-foot lengths in diameters up to 36 inches. BRISMET's Munhall facility manufactures stainless welded pipe as well as new product offerings in welded tube in diameters from 5/8 inch to five inches and gauges from 0.028 inch to 1/4 inch. Additionally, the Munhall facility produces galvanized carbon tube in custom sizes.
ASTI is a leading manufacturer of high-end ornamental stainless steel tube, supplying the automotive, commercial transportation, marine, food services, construction, furniture, healthcare, and other industries. Operating facilities are located in Troutman and Statesville, North Carolina. ASTI combines the use of superior metal quality with in-house capabilities in slitting and welding, along with our proprietary finishing capabilities and the highest levels of customer service and technical support to provide the customer with the highest quality ornamental product available in the market. Product range includes 1/2 inch outside diameter to 5 inch outside diameter, in a variety of shapes, including squares, rectangles and ellipticals. Refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
Palmer is a manufacturer of fiberglass and steel storage tanks for the oil and gas, waste water treatment and municipal water industries. Located in Andrews, Texas, Palmer is ideally located in the heart of a significant oil and gas production territory. Palmer produces made-to-order fiberglass tanks, utilizing a variety of custom mandrels and application specific materials. Its fiberglass tanks range from two feet to 30 feet in diameter at various heights. Most of these tanks are used for oil field waste water capture and are an integral part of the environmental regulatory compliance of the drilling process. Each fiberglass tank is manufactured to American Petroleum Institute Q1 standards to ensure product quality. Palmer's steel storage tank facility enables efficient, environmentally compliant production with designed-in expansion capability to support future growth. Finished steel tanks range in size predominantly from 50 to 1,500 barrels and are used to store extracted oil.
Specialty is a leading master distributor of hot finish, seamless, carbon steel pipe and tube, with an emphasis on large outside diameters and exceptionally heavy wall thickness. Specialty's products are primarily used for mechanical and high-pressure applications in the oil and gas, capital goods manufacturing, heavy industrial, construction equipment, paper and chemical industries. Operating from facilities located in Mineral Ridge, Ohio and Houston, Texas, Specialty is well-positioned to serve the major industrial and energy regions and successfully reach other target markets across the United States. Specialty performs value-added processing on approximately 80 percent of products shipped, which includes cutting to length, heat treatment, testing, boring and end finishing and typically processes and ships orders in 24 hours or less. Based upon its short lead times, Specialty plays a critical role in the supply chain, supplying long lead-time items to markets that demand fast deliveries, custom lengths, and reliable execution of orders.
The Metals Segment relies on 10 suppliers that furnish approximately 95 percent of total dollar purchases of raw materials and one supplier that furnishes 33 percent of material purchases. The Company does not believe that the loss of this supplier would have a materially adverse effect on the Company as raw materials are readily available from a number of different sources, and the Company anticipates no difficulties in fulfilling its requirements.
Specialty Chemicals Segment – The segment consists of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary MS&C. MS&C owns 100 percent of the membership interests of MC, which has a production facility in Cleveland, Tennessee. The segment also includes CRI Tolling which is located in Fountain Inn, South Carolina. MC and CRI Tolling are aggregated as one reporting unit and comprise the Specialty Chemicals Segment. Both facilities are fully licensed for chemical manufacturing. MC manufactures lubricants, surfactants, defoamers, reaction intermediaries, and sulfated fats and oils. CRI Tolling provides chemical tolling manufacturing resources to global and regional companies and contracts with other chemical companies to manufacture certain pre-defined products.
MC produces over 1,100 specialty formulations and intermediates for use in a wide variety of applications and industries. MC's primary product lines focus on the areas of defoamers, surfactants, and lubricating agents. These three fundamental product lines find their way into a large number of manufacturing businesses. Over the years, the customer list has grown to include end users and chemical companies that supply paper, metal working, surface coatings, water treatment, paint, mining, oil and gas, and janitorial applications. MC's capabilities also include the sulfation of fats and oils. These products are used in a wide variety of applications and represent a renewable resource, animal and vegetable derivatives, as alternatives to more expensive and non-renewable petroleum derivatives. 
MC's strategy has been to focus on industries and markets that have strong prospects for sustainability in the U.S. in light of global trends. MC's marketing strategy relies on sales to end users through its own sales force, but it also sells chemical intermediates to other chemical companies and distributors. MC also has close working relationships with a significant number of major chemical companies that outsource their production for regional manufacture and distribution to companies like MC. MC has been ISO registered since 1995.
CRI Tolling's business and strategy has been focused in toll manufacturing and providing services to many different end markets, such as the agrochemical, automotive, urethane, water treatment and coatings industries. CRI Tolling engages in sales efforts to other chemical companies in a wide array of markets through the use of its own sales force, manufacturer's representatives and through internal sales efforts involving staff interaction.
The Specialty Chemicals Segment maintains two laboratories for applied research and quality control which are staffed by 11 employees, including multiple chemists.
The majority of raw materials used by the segment are available from numerous independent suppliers and approximately 48 percent of total purchases are from its top 10 suppliers. While some raw material needs are met by a sole supplier or only a few suppliers, the Company anticipates no difficulties in fulfilling its raw material requirements.
See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, for financial information about the Company's segments.
Sales
Metals Segment – The Metals Segment utilizes separate sales organizations for its different product groups. Welded Pipe & Tube Operations include stainless steel and galvanized pipe and tube, sold worldwide under the BRISMET trade name and ornamental stainless tube, sold under the ASTI trade name in the U.S. and Canadian markets. Specialty includes the distribution of hot finish, seamless, carbon steel pipe and tube, with approximately 80 percent of Specialty's pipe and tube sales to North American pipe and tube distributors. Producing sales and providing service to distributors, OEM and end use customers are 44 sales representatives comprised of inside sales employees, outside sales employees and independent manufacturers' representatives. Customer feedback and in-field experience generate product enhancements and new product development. 
There were no customers representing more than 10 percent of the Metals Segment's revenues for 2020 or 2019, respectively.
Specialty Chemicals Segment – Specialty chemicals are sold directly to various industries nationwide by 10 sales representatives comprised of outside sales employees and independent manufacturers' representatives. The Specialty Chemicals Segment has one customer that accounted for approximately 16 percent of the segment's revenues for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Distribution
Metals Segment – Welded Pipe & Tube Operations produce the largest sales volume group of products in the Metals Segment. For stainless steel and galvanized pipe and tube, although information is not publicly available regarding the sales of the majority of other producers of these products, management believes that the Company is one of the largest domestic producers of such pipe and tube. ASTI is a leading manufacturer of high-end ornamental stainless steel tube, combining the use of superior metal quality with in-house capabilities in slitting and welding, along with our proprietary finishing capabilities and the highest levels of customer service and technical support to provide customers with the highest quality ornamental product available in the market.
Specialty is a leader in the specialized products segment of the pipe and tube market by offering an industry leading in-stock inventory of a broad range of high quality products, including specialized products with limited availability. Specialty's dual branches have both common and regional-specific products and capabilities.
Specialty Chemicals Segment – The Company is the sole producer of certain specialty chemicals manufactured for other companies under processing agreements and also produces proprietary specialty chemicals. The Company's sales of specialty products are insignificant compared to the overall market for specialty chemicals. The market for most of the products is highly competitive and many competitors have substantially more resources than the Company.
Mergers, Acquisitions and Dispositions
The Company is committed to a long-term strategy of (a) reinvesting capital in our current business segments to foster their organic growth, (b) disposing of underperforming business units, and (c) completing acquisitions that expand our business segments and geographic footprint or establish new manufacturing capabilities.
On January 1, 2019, ASTI completed the American Stainless acquisition. The purpose of the transaction was to extend and enhance the Company's on-going business with additional capacity and new technological advantages in the production of stainless ornamental tube. The purchase price was $21.9 million. American Stainless will also receive quarterly earn-out payments based on ASTI's revenue for a period of three years following closing. The tangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed from American Stainless included accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and accounts payable.
Environmental Matters
Environmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and do not contribute to future revenue generation are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or cleanups are probable and the costs of these assessments and/or cleanups can be reasonably estimated. Changes to laws and environmental issues, including climate change, are made or proposed with some frequency and some of the proposals, if adopted, might directly or indirectly result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. We are presently unable to quantify this risk due to such uncertainties.
Seasonality
The Company's businesses and products are generally not subject to seasonal impacts that result in significant variations in revenues from one quarter to another.
Backlogs
The Metals Segment's Welded Pipe & Tube Operations and the Specialty Chemicals Segment incur a significant dollar value of committed orders in advance of production. The backlog of open orders for the Welded Pipe & Tube Operations were $40.8 million and $35.4 million at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The backlog of open orders for the Specialty Chemicals Segment were $3.9 million and $1.5 million at the end of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our backlog may not be indicative of actual sales and, therefore, should not be used as a direct measure of future revenue. 
Human Capital
Safety and Wellness
The health and safety of our workforce is fundamental to the success of our business. We provide our employees upfront and ongoing safety training to ensure that safety policies and procedures are effectively communicated and implemented. Personal protective equipment is provided to employees to safely perform their job responsibilities. 
Because our business involves the manufacturing of physical products, many of our employees are unable to work from home. In an effort to keep our employees safe and maintain operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented new health-related measures, including social distancing, restrictions on visitors to our facilities, limiting in-person meetings and other gatherings, limiting company travel, increasing cleanings of our facilities and providing personal protective equipment and disinfecting agents to employees.
Talent Management
Our approach to human capital management is one that seeks to foster an inclusive and respectful work environment where employees are empowered at all levels to implement new ideas, to better serve our customers and continuously improve our processes and operations. Our business results depend on our ability to manage our human capital resources, including attracting, identifying, and retaining key talent. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include competition from other employers, availability of qualified individuals and opportunities for employee growth.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 526 employees. The Company considers relations with employees to be strong. The number of employees of the Company represented by unions, located at the Munhall, Pennsylvania, Mineral Ridge, Ohio, and Bristol, Tennessee facilities, is 232, or 44 percent of the Company's employees. They are represented by three locals affiliated with the United Steelworkers (the "USW"). Collective bargaining contracts for the USW locals expire at various dates between 2023 and 2024.
Our voluntary turnover rate in 2020 was approximately three percent. We monitor employee turnover rates by plant and the Company as a whole. The average tenure of our employees is approximately 10 years and we believe is driven by our competitive total rewards package offered to employees and development opportunities which promotes longer employee tenure and reduces voluntary turnover.
Total Rewards
We invest in our workforce by offering a competitive total rewards package that includes a combination of salaries and wages, health and wellness benefits, retirement benefits and educational benefits. We strive to offer competitive total rewards packages and benefits for eligible employees.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants for positions with the Company receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, identity, national origin, disability, or veteran status. We strive to provide an equitable and inclusive environment for all our employees with representation across all levels of our workforce that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we live and work.
