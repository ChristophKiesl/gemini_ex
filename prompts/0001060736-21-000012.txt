Item 1. Business
Overview
Seagen is a biotechnology company that develops and commercializes targeted therapies to treat cancer. We are commercializing ADCETRIS®, or brentuximab vedotin, for the treatment of certain CD30-expressing lymphomas, PADCEV®, or enfortumab vedotin-ejfv, for the treatment of certain metastatic urothelial cancers, and TUKYSA®, or tucatinib, for treatment of certain metastatic HER2-positive breast cancers. We are also advancing a pipeline of novel therapies for solid tumors and blood-related cancers designed to address unmet medical needs and improve treatment outcomes for patients. Many of our programs, including ADCETRIS and PADCEV, are based on our antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology that utilizes the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. In October 2020, we changed our corporate name from Seattle Genetics, Inc. to Seagen Inc., reflecting the global expansion of our operations.
Our strategy is to become a leading global oncology company developing and marketing targeted therapies for cancer. Key elements of our strategy are to maximize the potential of our approved medicines through successful commercial execution, expand the number of patients eligible to receive our medicines by securing approvals of our commercial products in other countries, conduct clinical trials designed to support additional labels for our products, and develop new first-in-class or best-in-class medicines. We seek to commercialize our products either on our own as we expand our operations globally or through commercial partnerships. We are deploying our internal research, clinical, development, regulatory and manufacturing expertise to advance and expand our deep pipeline of drug candidates aimed at gaining new product approvals. We conduct internal research directed at identifying novel antigen targets, monoclonal antibodies and other targeting molecules, creating new antibody engineering techniques and developing new classes of stable linkers and cell-killing agents in support of our continued ADC innovation. In addition, we supplement these internal efforts by acquiring or in-licensing products, product candidates and technologies from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions.
COVID-19
We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and are taking proactive efforts designed to protect the health and safety of our workforce, patients and healthcare professionals, and to continue our business operations and advance our goal of bringing important medicines to patients as rapidly as possible.
We continue to maintain measures designed to protect the health and safety of our workforce and to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including a mandatory work-from-home policy for employees who can perform their jobs offsite. We are continuing essential research, manufacturing, and laboratory activities on site and maintain a number of additional precautionary measures designed to protect these onsite employees, such as temperature checks, screening protocols, masks, social distancing, contact tracing and making testing available. In the conduct of our business activities, we are also taking actions designed to protect the safety of patients and healthcare professionals. Among other actions, our field-based personnel have paused most in-person customer interactions in healthcare settings and have been using primarily electronic communications to support healthcare professionals and patients. They are engaging in limited in-person interactions where state and local laws and regulations allow, the institution or office is accepting in-person interactions and our field-based personnel are comfortable engaging in-person with healthcare providers. See also “—Human Capital Resources—COVID-19” below. We believe that the measures we have implemented are appropriate and are helping to reduce transmission of COVID-19, and we will continue to monitor conditions and related guidance from governmental authorities and adjust our activities as appropriate. For information regarding the impacts of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability and the ability of our collaborators to effectively market, sell and distribute our products and to develop our products and product candidates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Outlook” in Part II Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

•*ADCETRIS, PADCEV and TUKYSA are only indicated for adults. 

ADCETRIS®
ADCETRIS is an ADC targeting CD30, which is a protein located on the surface of cells and highly expressed in Hodgkin lymphoma, certain T-cell lymphomas as well as other cancers. ADCETRIS first received approval in an initial indication by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 2011 and has since been approved in a total of six indications to treat Hodgkin lymphoma and T-cell lymphomas in various settings including as frontline therapy. 
Prior to the approval of ADCETRIS, the standard of care frontline therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and PTCL has seen limited improvement over the last few decades. Additionally, chemotherapy regimens have substantial associated toxicities and a significant number of lymphoma patients relapse and require additional treatments including other chemotherapy regimens and autologous stem cell transplant, or ASCT. Beyond our current labeled indications, we are evaluating ADCETRIS in several clinical trials to potentially broaden its use. 
ADCETRIS is commercially available in more than 75 countries worldwide. We commercialize ADCETRIS in the U.S. and its territories and in Canada, and we collaborate with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS on a global basis. Under this collaboration, Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world and pays us a royalty. Takeda has received regulatory approvals for ADCETRIS as monotherapy or in combination with agents in various settings for the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma or CD30-positive T-cell lymphomas in Europe and many countries throughout the rest of the world and is pursuing additional regulatory approvals.
PADCEV®
PADCEV is an ADC targeting Nectin-4, a protein expressed on the surface of cells and highly expressed in bladder cancer as well as other cancers. PADCEV was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in December 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-containing chemotherapy before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery in the locally advanced or metastatic setting. FDA approval of PADCEV was supported by data from a single-arm pivotal phase 2 clinical trial called EV-201. Continued approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a required confirmatory trial. As discussed further below, Astellas and we plan to submit a supplemental BLA to the FDA based on the global phase 3 clinical trial called EV-301 as the confirmatory trial.
In the metastatic setting, several PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors have been approved for urothelial cancer in the past several years and are improving outcomes for some patients, yet the vast majority of patients do not benefit, or relapse, and require additional treatment options. Prior to the approval of PADCEV in the U.S. there were no approved agents in the post-platinum-based therapy and post-checkpoint inhibitor setting, representing an unmet medical need. We are conducting clinical trials in frontline metastatic disease, muscle invasive bladder cancer and in a range of other solid tumors. In addition, we are working on a development strategy in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.
PADCEV, is being co-developed and jointly commercialized with Astellas Pharma, Inc., or Astellas. In the U.S., we and Astellas are jointly promoting PADCEV. In the U.S., we record net sales of PADCEV and are responsible for all distribution activities. We and Astellas each bear the costs of our own sales organizations in the U.S., equally share certain other costs associated with commercializing PADCEV in the U.S., and equally share in any profits realized in the U.S. 
TUKYSA®
TUKYSA is an oral, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, that is highly selective for HER2, a growth factor receptor overexpressed in many cancers. HER2 mediates cell growth, differentiation and survival. Tumors that over-express HER2 are generally more aggressive and historically have been associated with poor overall survival, compared with HER2-negative cancers. In April 2020, TUKYSA received approval from the FDA in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases, who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. FDA approval of TUKYSA was supported by data from the HER2CLIMB trial. We are conducting a broad clinical development program of TUKYSA including ongoing and planned trials in earlier lines of breast cancer and in other HER2-positive cancers. 
The FDA reviewed the application for approval under the Oncology Center of Excellence's, or OCE's, Real Time Oncology Review, or RTOR, pilot program. We also participated in the Project Orbis initiative of the FDA OCE which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology products among international partners. Under this program we have received approval from the following countries participating in the FDA's Project Orbis initiative: U.S., Canada, Australia, Singapore, and Switzerland. In February 2021, the European Commission, or EC, granted marketing authorization for TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine for the treatment of adult patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have received at least two prior anti-HER2 treatment regimens. This approval is valid in all countries of the European Union as well as Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Northern Ireland. We have also submitted a regulatory application to the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Product Regulatory Authority, or MHRA.
We are commercializing TUKYSA in the U.S. and Canada and also expect to commercialize TUKYSA in Europe. In September 2020, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with a subsidiary of Merck, or the TUKYSA Agreement, that granted exclusive rights to Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, to commercialize TUKYSA in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America and other regions outside of the U.S., Canada and Europe. The collaboration is intended to accelerate global availability of TUKYSA.

Clinical Development Status
ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin) 
Beyond our current labeled indications, we are evaluating ADCETRIS as monotherapy and in combination with other agents in ongoing trials which include several potential registration-enabling trials. In addition to our corporate-sponsored trials there are numerous investigator-sponsored trials of ADCETRIS in the United States. The investigator-sponsored trials include the use of ADCETRIS in a number of malignant hematologic indications and in solid tumors. 
As previously reported, the phase 3 ECHELON-1 trial achieved its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus AVD (Adriamycin [doxorubicin], vinblastine and dacarbazine) resulting in a statistically significant improvement in modified PFS compared to the control arm of ABVD, which includes bleomycin, in patients with Stage III and IV frontline classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Also previously reported, the phase 3 ECHELON-2 trial met its primary endpoint with the combination of ADCETRIS plus CHP (cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin [doxorubicin], vincristine, prednisone) resulting in a statistically significant improvement in PFS versus the control arm of CHOP in patients with CD30-expressing PTCL. In December 2020, five-year updates from the ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 clinical trials were presented at the 62nd American Society of Hematology annual meeting in December 2020. The five-year update of the ECHELON-1 clinical trial shows treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with AVD chemotherapy results in superior long-term outcomes when compared to ABVD. Additionally, the ECHELON-2 clinical trial continues to demonstrate significant durable improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival of ADCETRIS plus CHP when compared to CHOP.
PADCEV (enfortumab vedotin-ejfv)
In collaboration with Astellas we are conducting or planning to conduct clinical trials across the spectrum of bladder cancer including ongoing trials in frontline metastatic urothelial cancer and muscle invasive bladder cancer. We are planning a development strategy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer as well. In addition, we are conducting a trial in a range of other solid tumors. 
In September 2020, we announced that the global phase 3 clinical trial called EV-301, which compared PADCEV to chemotherapy in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1/L1 inhibitor, met its primary endpoint of overall survival, or OS, compared to chemotherapy. For patients in the PADCEV arm of the trial, rash, fatigue, and decreased neutrophil count were the most frequent Grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events occurring in more than 5 percent of patients. Astellas and we plan to submit a supplemental BLA based on the EV-301 results to the FDA as the confirmatory trial following PADCEV's accelerated approval in December 2019. EV-301 is also intended to support global regulatory submissions.
In October 2020, we announced positive topline results from the second cohort of patients in the pivotal phase 2 EV-201 trial. The cohort is evaluating PADCEV for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor and have not received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and are ineligible for cisplatin. We plan to submit a supplemental BLA to the FDA based on the results which is intended to support an indication in this setting. 
PADCEV is also being investigated in frontline metastatic urothelial cancer and earlier stages of bladder cancer. We and Astellas are conducting a phase 1b/2 clinical trial, called EV-103, that is a multi-cohort, open-label trial of PADCEV alone or in combination with the anti-PD-1 therapy pembrolizumab. The trial is evaluating safety, tolerability and activity in locally advanced and first- and second-line metastatic urothelial cancer, and was expanded to include muscle invasive bladder cancer, or MIBC. In February 2020, updated results from the trial in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who were ineligible for treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were presented at the 2020 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium.

In February 2020, based on the positive initial results of the EV-103 trial, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are unable to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the first-line setting. In April 2020, we announced that based on discussions with the FDA, data from the randomized cohort K in the EV-103 trial, along with other data from the EV-103 trial, could potentially support registration under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway. The primary outcome measures are objective response rate and duration of response. We expect to complete enrollment in cohort K by the end of 2021.
In addition to the potential accelerated approval pathway based on the EV-103 trial, we are conducting a global, registrational phase 3 trial, called EV-302, in frontline metastatic urothelial cancer in collaboration with Astellas and a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck. We, Astellas and Merck are jointly funding EV-302 and the trial is being led by us. EV-302 is an open-label, randomized phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the combination of PADCEV and pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy alone in patients with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. The trial includes metastatic urothelial cancer patients who are either eligible or ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The trial has dual primary endpoints of progression-free survival and overall survival and is intended to support global regulatory submissions and potentially serve as a confirmatory trial if accelerated approval is granted based on EV-103. 
In April 2020, we and Astellas entered into an agreement with Merck to evaluate PADCEV in MIBC. Merck has amended its ongoing phase 3 KEYNOTE-905/EV-303 registrational trial in cisplatin-ineligible patients with MIBC to include an arm evaluating PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab. In October 2020, we and Astellas entered into an agreement with Merck to evaluate PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab in a phase 3 trial, called KEYNOTE-B15/EV-304, to be conducted by Merck in cisplatin-eligible patients with MIBC which was initiated in the first quarter of 2021. 
In January 2020, we and Astellas also initiated a phase 2 clinical trial, called EV-202, to evaluate PADCEV monotherapy in solid tumors that have high-levels of Nectin-4 expression, including non-small cell lung, head and neck, gastric/esophageal and breast cancers. In March 2020, the first patient was dosed in the trial.
Since the launch of PADCEV we have continued to monitor product safety in clinical trials and in the post marketing setting. Nectin-4, which PADCEV targets, is expressed in the skin, and rash is a common adverse event associated with PADCEV use, but is generally mild and reversible. Severe rashes, however, do occur and are described in the current U.S. prescribing information. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions including fatal cases of Stevens Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred in patients treated with PADCEV in the post marketing setting and during clinical trials. We have communicated the occurrence of these rare events via a letter together with updated recommendations to health care providers who may treat patients with urothelial cancer. We are working with the FDA regarding updates to the U.S. prescribing information to reflect these events. The overall benefit-risk balance remains favorable for the use of PADCEV in its approved indication.
TUKYSA (tucatinib)
We are conducting a broad clinical development program of TUKYSA including ongoing and planned trials in earlier lines of breast cancer and in other HER2-positive cancers. 
In October 2019, we initiated a phase 3 randomized trial, called HER2CLIMB-02, evaluating TUKYSA versus placebo, each in combination with T-DM1, for patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including those with brain metastases, who have had prior treatment with a taxane and trastuzumab. 
We are supporting a U.S. cooperative group that is conducting a phase 3 randomized trial, called CompassHER2 RD, which is evaluating TUKYSA in combination with T-DM1 in the adjuvant setting for patients with high-risk, HER2-positive breast cancer.
We are also conducting a phase 2 trial, called HER2CLIMB-04, evaluating TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab deruxtecan in previously treated locally-advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. 
We are conducting a phase 2 trial, called MOUNTAINEER, evaluating TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive, RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer after treatment with first- and second-line standard-of-care therapies. Initial results from 23 patients were presented at the ESMO 2019 Congress that demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity. We believe the trial could potentially support an application for accelerated approval in the U.S.
We are conducting a phase 2/3 trial, called MOUNTAINEER-02, in combination with trastuzumab, ramucirumab and paclitaxel in second-line HER2-positive metastatic gastroesophageal cancer. We have also initiated a phase 1b trial evaluating TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab and oxaliplatin based chemotherapy in first-line HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic colorectal, gastric, esophageal and gallbladder cancers. 
Tisotumab Vedotin
In collaboration with Genmab we are developing tisotumab vedotin for metastatic cervical cancer and are evaluating it for other solid tumors.
We and Genmab are conducting a pivotal phase 2 trial, called innovaTV 204, evaluating single-agent tisotumab vedotin for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer who have relapsed or progressed after standard of care treatment. In September 2020, data from the innovaTV 204 trial were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, Virtual Congress 2020. Results from the trial showed a 24 percent confirmed objective response rate, or ORR, by independent central review with a median duration of response, or DOR, of 8.3 months. The most common treatment-related adverse events (greater than or equal to 20 percent) included alopecia, epistaxis (nose bleeds), nausea, conjunctivitis, fatigue and dry eye. In February 2021, we submitted a BLA to the FDA seeking accelerated approval for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who have relapsed or progressed on or after prior treatment.
In January 2021, we and Genmab initiated a phase 3 clinical trial, called innovaTV 301, to evaluate tisotumab vedotin compared to chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who have received one or two prior lines of therapy. innovaTV 301 is intended to support global regulatory applications for potential approvals in regions where innovaTV 204 does not support approval and to potentially serve as a confirmatory trial in the U.S. if we are able to obtain accelerated approval based on the tisotumab vedotin BLA submission.
We are also conducting a phase 2 clinical trial, called innovaTV 205, evaluating tisotumab vedotin as monotherapy and in combination with certain other anti-cancer agents for first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or advanced cervical cancer. Additionally, we are conducting a phase 2 clinical trial, called innovaTV 207, for patients with relapsed, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors and a phase 2 clinical trial, called innovaTV 208, for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. 
Ladiratuzumab Vedotin
We are developing ladiratuzumab vedotin, or LV, an ADC targeting LIV-1, which is currently being evaluated in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents for patients with metastatic breast cancer and select solid tumors with high LIV-1 expression. In September 2020, we and a subsidiary of Merck entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the LV Agreement, under which the companies will jointly develop and share future costs and profits worldwide for LV.
Other clinical and early-stage product candidates
We are advancing a pipeline of early-stage clinical candidates as well as multiple preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies. We advanced several product candidates into clinical development in 2020 and we plan to submit additional IND applications to the FDA in 2021. 
Our Antibody-Drug Conjugate (ADC) Technology
ADCETRIS, PADCEV and many product candidates in our clinical-stage pipeline utilize our ADC technology. ADCs are monoclonal antibodies that are linked to cytotoxic, or cell-killing, agents. Our ADCs utilize monoclonal antibodies that internalize within target cells after binding to a specified cell-surface receptor. Enzymes present inside the cell catalyze the release of the cytotoxic agent from the monoclonal antibody, which then results in the desired activity, specific killing of the target cell.
A key component of our ADCs are the linkers that attach the cell-killing agent to the monoclonal antibody. The drug linkers are designed to deliver the cytotoxic agent to tumors by virtue of the monoclonal antibody binding to the intended cell surface receptor on the target cell. The cytotoxic agent is released when the ADC internalizes within the target cell, resulting in cell killing. This targeted delivery of the cell-killing agent is intended to maximize delivery of the cytotoxic agent to targeted cells while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues. Our most advanced ADCs, including ADCETRIS, PADCEV, tisotumab vedotin and LV, use our proprietary auristatin-based ADC technology. Auristatins are microtubule disrupting agents. In contrast to natural products that are often more difficult to produce and link to antibodies, the cytotoxic drugs used in our ADCs are synthetically produced and are readily scalable for manufacturing. This technology is also the basis of our ADC collaborations. We own or hold exclusive or partially-exclusive licenses to multiple issued patents and patent applications covering our ADC technology. We continue to evaluate new linkers, antibody formats and cell-killing agents for use in our ADC programs.
Our Sugar-Engineered Antibody (SEA) Technology
Our proprietary SEA technology is a method to selectively reduce fucose incorporation in monoclonal antibodies as they are produced in cell line-based manufacturing. Our preclinical data show that this results in increased binding to innate immune effector cells and enhanced potency in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC, in tumor cells. We believe this enhancement in ADCC activity may provide improved anti-tumor activity. Our SEA technology is a novel approach to modify the activity of monoclonal antibodies that is complementary to our ADC technology.
A key feature of our SEA technology is that no genetic modification of the antibody-producing cell line is necessary and standard cell culture conditions can be used while maintaining the underlying manufacturing processes, yields and product quality. We believe the SEA approach may be simpler and more cost-effective to implement as compared to existing technologies for enhancing antibody effector function, most of which require development of new cell lines. 
We have several product candidates that are being evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials that utilize our SEA technology including SEA-CD40, SEA-TGT, SEA-BCMA and SEA-CD70. These agents are targeted at a variety of cancer types.
Other Technologies
In addition, we utilize other technologies designed to maximize antitumor activity and reduce toxicity of antibody-based therapies. Genetic engineering enables us to produce antibodies that are optimized for their intended uses. For ADCs, we screen and select antibodies that bind to antigens that are differentially expressed on tumor cells versus vital normal tissues, rapidly internalized within target cells and have potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical models. For our SEA technology we produce antibodies that demonstrate potent anti-tumor activities by virtue of ADCC, or through additional immune stimulatory mechanisms that are triggered by the enhanced binding potency to innate immune cells. Our ADCs utilize native or engineered conjugation sites to optimize drug attachment. In some cases, we evaluate the use of our monoclonal antibodies and ADCs in combination with conventional chemotherapy and other anticancer agents, which may result in increased antitumor activity. 
Research Programs
In addition to our pipeline of current product candidates and technologies, we have internal research programs directed toward developing new classes of potent anti-tumor and immune stimulatory agents and new ADC linkers, the identification of novel drug targets and monoclonal antibodies, and advancing our antibody engineering initiatives.
New Tumor Cell-Killing Agents. We continue to identify and study new agents with anti-tumor mechanisms of action that will provide pipeline diversity and complement the auristatins that we currently use in our ADC technology. We also seek to develop new drugs that are designed to activate the host immune system by targeting key immune stimulatory pathways that can mediate innate or adaptive anti-tumor immune responses. 
New Drug Linkers. We are conducting research with the intent to develop new ADC linkers that are designed to provide the appropriate stability in the bloodstream and drug release characteristics to effectively target cancer cells and improved cancer cell selectivity and tolerability.
Novel Monoclonal Antibodies and Antigen Targets. We are actively engaged in internal efforts to identify and develop monoclonal antibodies, and other therapeutic molecules, to target tumor antigens and important tumor or immune pathways. For ADCs, we focus on drug targets that are highly expressed on the surface of cancer cells that have the appropriate expression, distribution and internalization properties that make them desirable as monoclonal antibody or ADC targets. We may then create and screen panels of cancer-reactive monoclonal antibodies in our laboratories to identify those with the desired specificity and optimized drug delivery properties. Additionally, we identify targets that play key roles in anti-tumor innate or adaptive immune responses and identify antibodies and other therapeutic molecules to stimulate an anti-tumor immune response. We supplement these internal efforts by evaluating opportunities to in-license targets and antibodies from academic groups and other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, such as our ongoing collaborations with Astellas and Genmab.
Antibody Engineering. We have substantial internal expertise in antibody engineering including humanization, binding affinity optimization, enhancement of immunological function by blocking fucosylation, as well as engineering antibodies to improve drug linkage sites for use with our ADC technology. By modifying the number and type of drug-linkage sites found on our antibodies, we believe that we can improve ADC drug properties and the cost-effectiveness of our manufacturing processes for conjugation of ADCs.
Corporate Collaborations
We enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to advance the development and commercialization of our product candidates and to supplement our internal pipeline. We seek collaborations that will allow us to retain significant future participation in product sales through either profit-sharing or royalties paid on net sales. We also have licensed our technologies to collaborators to be developed with their own antibodies. These collaborations benefit us in many ways, including generating cash flow and revenues that partially offset expenditures on our internal research and development programs, expanding our knowledge base regarding ADCs across multiple targets and antibodies provided by our collaborators and providing us with future pipeline opportunities through co-development or opt-in rights to new product candidates.
Takeda ADCETRIS Collaboration
We have an agreement with Takeda for the global co-development of ADCETRIS and the commercialization of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territory. We have commercial rights for ADCETRIS in the U.S. and its territories and in Canada. Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world. Under the collaboration, we and Takeda can each conduct development activities and equally co-fund the cost of certain mutually agreed development activities. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense.
As of December 31, 2020, we had achieved milestone payments totaling $157.5 million related to regulatory and commercial progress by Takeda. As of December 31, 2020, total future potential development and regulatory milestone payments to us under this collaboration could total $77.0 million. In addition, we recognize royalty revenues, where royalties are based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS in its licensed territories, with percentages ranging from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on annual net sales tiers, and sales-based milestones. Takeda bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS, which is included in royalty revenues. 
Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured. Takeda may terminate the collaboration agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to us and we may terminate the collaboration agreement in certain circumstances. The collaboration agreement can also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties. If neither party terminates the collaboration agreement, then the agreement automatically terminates on the expiration of all payment obligations.
Astellas PADCEV Collaboration
We have a collaboration agreement with Agensys, Inc., which subsequently became an affiliate of Astellas, to jointly research, develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer. The collaboration encompasses combinations of our ADC technology with fully-human antibodies developed by Astellas to proprietary cancer targets. Under this collaboration, we and Astellas are co-funding all development costs for PADCEV. 
In 2018, we and Astellas entered into a joint commercialization agreement to govern the global commercialization of PADCEV:
•In the U.S., we and Astellas jointly promote PADCEV. We record sales of PADCEV in the U.S. and are responsible for all U.S. distribution activities. The companies each bear the costs of their own sales organizations in the U.S., equally share certain other costs associated with commercializing PADCEV in the U.S., and equally share in any profits realized in the U.S. 
•Outside the U.S., we have commercialization rights in all countries in North and South America, and Astellas has commercialization rights in the rest of the world, including Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa. The agreement is intended to provide that we and Astellas will effectively equally share in costs incurred and any profits realized in all of these markets. Cost and profit sharing in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain and Italy will be based on product sales and costs of commercialization. In the remaining markets, the commercializing party will bear costs and will pay the other party a royalty rate applied to net sales of the product based on a rate intended to approximate an equal profit share for both parties.
Astellas or its affiliates are responsible for overseeing the manufacturing supply chain for PADCEV for development and commercial use. However, we are responsible for packaging and labeling in countries in which we sell PADCEV. In addition, we are responsible for establishing a second source supply chain, whether through internal or third party sources.
Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party becomes insolvent or the other party materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured. Subject to certain restrictions, either party may terminate the collaboration agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to the other party. The collaboration agreement can also be terminated by mutual written consent of the parties. If neither party exercises its option to terminate the collaboration agreement, then the agreement will automatically terminate on the later of the expiration of all payment obligations pursuant to the collaboration agreement, or the day upon which we and Astellas cease to develop and commercialize products under the agreement. 
Either party may terminate the joint commercialization agreement if the other party becomes insolvent. The joint commercialization agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon complete cessation of the commercialization, launch and selling of PADCEV in that country.
Either party may also opt out of co-development and profit-sharing under the collaboration agreement in return for receiving milestones and royalties from the continuing party. In addition, either party may opt out of co-development and profit-sharing for PADCEV on a country-by-country basis, in return for receiving royalties pursuant to the collaboration agreement from the continuing party with respect to that country.
Merck TUKYSA Collaboration
In September 2020, we entered into the TUKYSA Agreement with Merck. Under the TUKYSA Agreement, we granted Merck exclusive rights to commercialize TUKYSA in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America and other regions outside of the U.S., Canada and Europe. Merck is responsible for marketing applications for approval in its territory, supported by the positive results from the HER2CLIMB clinical trial. We retained commercial rights in, and will record sales in, the U.S., Canada and Europe. Merck also agreed to co-fund a portion of the TUKYSA global development plan, which encompasses several ongoing and planned trials across HER2-positive cancers. We will continue to lead ongoing TUKYSA global development operational execution. Merck will solely fund and conduct country-specific clinical trials necessary to support anticipated regulatory applications in its territories. Under the TUKYSA Agreement, we are responsible for supplying Merck with TUKYSA for the purpose of clinical development and commercialization. We received an upfront cash payment from Merck of $125.0 million and also received $85.0 million in prepaid research and development funding to be applied to Merck’s global development cost sharing obligations. We are eligible to receive progress-dependent milestone payments of up to $65.0 million, and are entitled to receive tiered royalties on sales of TUKYSA by Merck that begin in the low twenty percent range and escalate based sales volume by Merck in its territory. We owe Array Biopharma Inc., or Array, an affiliate of Pfizer, a portion of any non-royalty payments received from sublicensing TUKYSA rights, as well as a low double-digit royalty based on net sales of TUKYSA by us, and will owe a single-digit royalty based on net sales of TUKYSA by Merck in its territories.
Genmab Tisotumab Vedotin Collaboration
We have a collaboration agreement with Genmab to develop and commercialize ADCs targeting tissue factor, under which we previously exercised a co-development option for tisotumab vedotin. Under this collaboration, we and Genmab are co-funding all development costs for tisotumab vedotin. In February 2021, we submitted a BLA for tisotumab vedotin to the FDA seeking accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy.
In October 2020, we and Genmab entered into a joint commercialization agreement to govern the global commercialization of tisotumab vedotin:
•In the U.S., we and Genmab will co-promote tisotumab vedotin. We will record sales of tisotumab vedotin in the U.S. and will be responsible for leading U.S. distribution activities. The companies will each hire and maintain 50% of the sales representatives and medical science liaisons, equally share those and certain other costs associated with commercializing tisotumab vedotin in the U.S., and equally share in any profits realized in the U.S.
•Outside the U.S., we have commercialization rights in the rest of the world except for Japan, where Genmab has commercialization rights. In Europe, China, and Japan, we and Genmab will equally share 50% of the costs associated with commercializing tisotumab vedotin as well as any profits realized in these markets. In markets outside the U.S. other than Europe, China, and Japan, aside from certain costs enumerated in the agreement, we will be solely responsible for all costs associated with commercializing tisotumab vedotin, and will pay Genmab a royalty based on a percentage of aggregate net sales ranging from the mid-teens to mid-twenties.
We currently rely on Genmab for the supply of tisotumab vedotin. However, in connection with the joint commercialization agreement, we will be responsible for overseeing the clinical and any commercial manufacturing of tisotumab vedotin following a transition period. Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement or the joint commercialization agreement if the other party becomes insolvent or materially breaches the applicable agreement and such breach remains uncured. In addition, either party may terminate the collaboration agreement if such party’s patent rights subject to the agreement are challenged by the other party or its sublicensees. Either party may also opt out of co-development and profit-sharing under the collaboration agreement in return for receiving milestones and royalties from the continuing party. The opt out provisions of the collaboration agreement may also be applied to the joint commercialization agreement. In addition, Genmab may elect to opt out of co-promotion of tisotumab vedotin in the United States by providing us with prior written notice.
Merck LV Collaboration
In September 2020, we entered into the LV Agreement with Merck. Under the terms of the LV Agreement, we granted Merck a co-exclusive worldwide development and commercialization license for LV and agreed to jointly develop and commercialize LV on a worldwide basis. We received an upfront cash payment of $600.0 million, and we are eligible to receive up to $850.0 million in milestone payments upon the initiation of certain clinical trials and regulatory approval in certain major markets, and up to an additional $1.75 billion in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual global net sales thresholds. Each company is responsible for 50% of global costs to develop and commercialize LV and will receive 50% of potential future profits. We will lead regulatory and distribution activities, and will record sales, in the United States and Canada. Merck will lead regulatory activities in Europe, and we will lead distribution activities and record sales in Europe. We and Merck will co-commercialize LV in the United States and Europe. Merck will lead regulatory, promotion and distribution activities, and will record sales, in countries outside of the United States, Canada and Europe.
The LV Agreement will remain in effect, unless earlier terminated, until LV is no longer being developed or commercialized under the LV Agreement. The LV Agreement also contains customary provisions for termination by Merck for convenience, and by either party, including in the event of breach of the LV Agreement, subject to cure, or upon a challenge of such party’s licensed patents or upon the other party’s bankruptcy, subject, in each case, to customary reversion rights.
In connection with the LV Agreement, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Merck in September 2020, referred to as the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and Merck agreed to purchase 5,000,000 newly-issued shares of our common stock, at a purchase price of $200 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.0 billion. We closed the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement on October 27, 2020 following the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.
ADC License Agreements
We have license agreements for our ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Under these agreements, which we have entered into in the ordinary course of business, we have granted research and commercial licenses to use our technology, most often in conjunction with the licensee's technology. In certain agreements, we also have agreed to conduct limited development activities and to provide other materials, supplies, and services to our licensees during a specified term of the agreement. We typically receive upfront cash payments and progress- and sales-dependent milestones for the achievement by our licensees of certain events, and annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. We also are entitled to receive royalties on net sales of any resulting products incorporating our ADC technology. Our licensees are solely responsible for research, product development, manufacturing and commercialization of any product candidates under these agreements, which includes the achievement of the potential milestones.
In 2019, Genentech received accelerated approval from the FDA for PolivyTM (polatuzumab vedotin-piic), an ADC that uses our technology, to treat patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In August 2020, GlaxoSmithKline plc, or GSK, received accelerated approval from the FDA and conditional marketing authorization from the EC for Blenrep™ (belantamab mafodotin-blmf), an ADC developed by GSK that uses our technology, for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior therapies including an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent. Under our ADC license agreements with Genentech and GSK, these events triggered milestone payments to us and we are also entitled receive royalties on net sales of Polivy and Blenrep worldwide. The product candidates being developed under our other ADC license agreements are at various stages of clinical and preclinical development. Our ability to generate meaningful future revenues from our other ADC license agreements will largely depend on products that incorporate our technologies entering late-stage clinical development, and receiving marketing approval from the FDA and subsequently being commercialized, if any.
In-license Agreements
We have in-licensed antibodies, targets and enabling technologies from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions for use in our pipeline programs and ADC technology, including the following: 
•Bristol-Myers Squibb License. In 1998, we obtained rights to some of our technologies and product candidates, portions of which are exclusive, through a license agreement with BMS. Through this license, we secured rights to use various targeting technologies. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to pay royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products, including ADCETRIS, which incorporate various technologies owned by BMS. Our obligation to pay royalties on ADCETRIS under the agreement expires in August 2021. The term of the license agreement expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis upon the later of the expiration of the last valid claim covering the applicable product within that country or either ten or twelve years depending on the particular patents applicable to the product after the first commercial sale of the applicable product within that country. We and BMS each have the right to terminate the license agreement prior to its expiration for insolvency or material breach, subject to cure and dispute resolution provisions. In addition, the license agreement will terminate automatically in the event that we fail to maintain certain required insurance.
•University of Miami License. In 1999, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the University of Miami, Florida, covering an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody that is the basis for the antibody component of ADCETRIS. Under the terms of this license, we made an upfront payment and progress-dependent milestone payments. We are required to pay annual maintenance fees and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products, including ADCETRIS, incorporating technology licensed from the University of Miami. The term of the license agreement expires ten years after the first commercial sale of ADCETRIS or on August 21, 2021, upon which we will have in perpetuity a fully paid-up, royalty free, nonexclusive, sublicensable license. We and the University of Miami each have the right to terminate the license agreement prior to its expiration for insolvency or material breach, subject to cure provisions.
•Array BioPharma, Inc. We are a party to a license agreement with Array, which was acquired by Pfizer in July 2019. Pursuant to the license agreement, Array has granted us an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize TUKYSA. We will pay Array a portion of any non-royalty payments received from sublicensing TUKSYA rights, including non-royalty payments received from Merck pursuant to the TUKYSA Agreement. Array is also entitled to receive a low double-digit royalty based on net sales of TUKYSA by us and a single-digit royalty based on any net sales of TUKYSA by our sublicensees, including Merck. The term of the license agreement expires on a country-by-country basis upon the later of the expiration of the last valid claim covering TUKYSA within that country or 10 years after the first commercial sale of TUKYSA within that country. We and Array each have the right to terminate the license agreement prior to its expiration for insolvency or material breach, subject to cure and dispute resolution provisions. 
•Other Licenses. Under the terms of in-license agreements related to our pipeline programs, we would potentially owe development, regulatory, and sales-based milestones, and royalties on net sales of certain approved products. 
Patents and Proprietary Technology
Our owned and licensed patents and patent applications are directed to ADCETRIS, PADCEV, TUKYSA, our product candidates, monoclonal antibodies, our ADC and SEA technologies and other antibody-based and/or enabling technologies. We commonly seek patent claims directed to compositions of matter, including antibodies, ADCs, and drug-linkers containing highly potent cell-killing agents, as well as methods of using such compositions. When appropriate, we also seek claims to related technologies, such as methods of using certain sugar analogs utilized in our SEA technology. For each of our products and product candidates, we have filed or expect to file multiple patent applications. We maintain patents and prosecute applications worldwide for technologies that we have out-licensed, such as our ADC technology. Similarly, for partnered products and product candidates, such as ADCETRIS, PADCEV, TUKYSA, tisotumab vedotin and LV, we seek to work closely with our development partners to coordinate patent efforts, including patent application filings, prosecution, term extension, defense and enforcement. As our products and product candidates advance through research and development, we seek to diligently identify and protect new inventions, such as combination therapies, improvements to methods of manufacturing, and methods of treatment. We also work closely with our scientific personnel to identify and protect new inventions that could eventually add to our development pipeline.
We own or have rights to the following patents relating to our products and our pipeline (in addition to certain patents covering our early-stage product candidates):
•For ADCETRIS and our related ADC technology, we own twelve patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2021 and 2031.
•For PADCEV and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to thirteen patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2022 and 2031. Of these patents, we own or co-own eleven patents and have licensed rights to two patents.
•For TUKYSA, we have licensed rights to nine patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2024 and 2033.
•For tisotumab vedotin and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to eleven patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2022 and 2036. Of these patents, we own or co-own five patents and have licensed rights to six patents.
•For LV and our related ADC technology, we own, co-own or have licensed rights to nine patents in the United States and Europe that will expire between 2022 and 2032. Of these patents, we own or co-own eight patents and have licensed rights to one patent.
The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country. The list above does not identify all patents that may be related to our products and product candidates. For example, in addition to the listed patents, we have patents on platform technologies (that relate to certain general classes of products or methods), as well as patents that relate to methods of using, manufacturing or administering a product or product candidate, that may confer additional patent protection. We also have pending patent applications that may give rise to new patents related to one or more of these agents.
The information in the above list is based on our current assessment of patents that we own, co-own or control or have licensed. The information is subject to revision, for example, in the event of changes in the law or legal rulings affecting our patents or if we become aware of new information. Significant legal issues remain unresolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biotechnology products and processes in the U.S. and other important markets outside the U.S. We expect that litigation will likely be necessary to determine the term, validity, enforceability, and/or scope of certain of our patents and other proprietary rights. An adverse decision or ruling with respect to one or more of our patents could result in the loss of patent protection for a product and, in turn, the introduction of competitor products or follow-on biologics to the market earlier than anticipated, and could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using a technology or commercializing a product.
Patents expire, on a country by country basis, at various times depending on various factors, including the filing date of the corresponding patent application(s), the availability of patent term extension and supplemental protection certificates and requirements for terminal disclaimers. Although we believe our owned and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We and our corporate collaborators may not be able to develop patentable products or processes or obtain patents from pending patent applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue. In the event of issuance, the patents may not be sufficient to protect the proprietary technology owned by or licensed to us or our corporate collaborators. Our or our collaborators’ current patents, or patents that issue on pending applications, may be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented. In addition, changes to patent laws in the United States or in other countries may limit our ability to defend or enforce our patents, or may apply retroactively to affect the term and/or scope of our patents. Our patents have been and may in the future be challenged by third parties in post-issuance administrative proceedings or in litigation as invalid, not infringed or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws, or they may be infringed by third parties. As a result, we are or may be from time to time involved in the defense and enforcement of our patent or other intellectual property rights in a court of law and administrative tribunals, such as in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office inter partes review or reexamination proceedings, foreign opposition proceedings or related legal and administrative proceedings in the United States and elsewhere. The costs of defending our patents or enforcing our proprietary rights in post-issuance administrative proceedings or litigation may be substantial and the outcome can be uncertain. An adverse outcome may allow third parties to use our proprietary technologies without a license from us or our collaborators. Our and our collaborators’ patents may also be circumvented, which may allow third parties to use similar technologies without a license from us or our collaborators. 
Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover technologies similar to the technologies owned or licensed to us or to our collaborators. In addition, we are monitoring the progress of multiple pending patent applications of other organizations that, if granted, may require us to license or challenge their validity or enforceability in order to continue commercializing ADCETRIS, PADCEV, or TUKYSA or to commercialize our product candidates. Our challenges to patents of other organizations may not be successful, which may affect our ability to commercialize ADCETRIS, PADCEV, TUKYSA or our product candidates. We cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our or our collaborators’ ability to make, use or sell ADCETRIS, PADCEV, TUKYSA or any other products or product candidates.
We require our scientific personnel to maintain laboratory notebooks and other research records in accordance with our policies, which are designed to strengthen and support our intellectual property protection. In addition to our patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a proprietary information and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. These agreements provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements also provide that we will own all inventions conceived or reduced to practice by the individual in the course of rendering services to us. Our policy and agreements and those of our collaborators may not sufficiently protect our confidential information, or third parties may independently develop equivalent information.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, marketing and distribution of biopharmaceutical products. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, distribution, import, export, recordkeeping, pricing, advertising and promotion of products and product candidates. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in Warning Letters, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. We must obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA before we can begin marketing them in the United States. Similar approvals are also required in other countries.
Product development and approval within this regulatory framework is uncertain, can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. The necessary steps before a new biopharmaceutical product may be sold in the United States ordinarily include: 
•preclinical in vitro and in vivo tests, some of which must comply with Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP;
•submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical trials may commence, and which must be updated periodically as new information is obtained and at least annually with a report on development;
•development of a drug formulation and manufacture of the drug for clinical trials, and commercial sale, if approved;
•completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of a BLA or NDA which must be accompanied by a substantial user fee unless the fee is waived;
•FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities for current Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, compliance and FDA inspection of select clinical trial sites and/or trial sponsors for Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, compliance; and
•FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA, which includes the product prescribing information, prior to any commercial sale.
Clinical Trials Regulation in the U.S.
The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as preclinical GLP studies to evaluate toxicity) for a particular product candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, and a clinical protocol are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30 day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. New clinical trial protocols can be submitted to the existing IND during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually-identifiable information.
Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or in some instances, be skipped. In phase 1, the initial introduction of the product into humans, the product candidate is tested to assess safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions associated with increasing doses. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the efficacy of the potential product for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimum dosage and further identify possible adverse reactions and safety risks. Phase 3 and pivotal trials are undertaken to evaluate further clinical efficacy and safety often in comparison to standard therapies within a broader patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical sites. Phase 4, or post-marketing, trials may be required as a condition of commercial approval by the FDA and may also be voluntarily initiated by us or our collaborators. Phase 1, phase 2 or phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specific period of time, if at all, with respect to any of our product candidates. Similarly, suggestions of safety, tolerability or efficacy in earlier stage trials do not necessarily predict findings of safety and efficacy in subsequent trials. Furthermore, the FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical trials are subject to central registration and results reporting requirements, such as on www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Approval Process in the U.S.
The results of preclinical studies, pharmaceutical development and clinical trials, together with information on a product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, are submitted to the FDA, in the form of a BLA or NDA, for approval of the manufacture, marketing and commercial shipment of the pharmaceutical product. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA and other regulatory agencies may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. The FDA may also convene an Advisory Committee of external advisors to answer questions regarding the approvability and labeling of an application. The FDA is not obligated to follow the Advisory Committee’s recommendation. The submission of a BLA or NDA is required to be accompanied by a substantial user fee, with few exceptions or waivers. The user fee is administered under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, which sets goals for the timeliness of the FDA’s review. A standard review period is twelve months from submission of an original application, while priority review is eight months from submission of an original application. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time, effort and resources, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny review of an application by refusing to file the application or not approve an application by issuance of a complete response letter if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, or require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Approval may occur with significant Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, that limit the clinical use in the prescribing information, distribution or promotion of a product. 
Drug or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval from the FDA upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials. 
Once an approval is issued, the FDA may require safety-related labeling changes or withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require further testing of an approved product, including phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of the approved product, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of the approved product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 
Post-Approval Regulations in the U.S.
Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including manufacture, labeling, distribution, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion, and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. 
Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and Warning Letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection, can list conditions the FDA investigators believe may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations or guidance. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observations(s) can result in further regulatory enforcement action. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and Warning Letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, not approve our products, require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval of the BLA or NDA for that product. Failure to comply with ongoing regulatory obligations can result in delay of approval or Warning Letters, product seizures, criminal penalties, and withdrawal of approved products, among other enforcement remedies.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and off-label promotion. While physicians may prescribe products for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote products for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
Certain of our products and product candidates may rely upon in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our therapeutics. If safe and effective use of a therapeutic product depends on an in vitro diagnostic, the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of a reproducible, validated diagnostic test to be used with our therapeutic product at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our cancer treatments involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The FDA’s premarket approval, or PMA, process is costly, lengthy, and uncertain. The receipt and timing of PMA approval may have a significant effect on the receipt and timing of any future commercial approvals for our products and product candidates. Human diagnostic products are subject to pervasive and ongoing regulatory obligations, including the submission of medical device reports, adherence to the Quality Systems Regulation, recordkeeping and product labeling, as enforced by the FDA and comparable state authorities. 
The FDA's approval of ADCETRIS in the frontline PTCL indication included a post-marketing commitment to develop a clinically validated in-vitro diagnostic device for the selection of patients with CD30-expressing PTCL, not including sALCL, for treatment with ADCETRIS in this indication. We and Takeda have a collaboration with Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., or Ventana, under which Ventana is working to develop, manufacture and commercialize a companion diagnostic test to measure CD30 expression levels in tissue specimens. If Ventana develops an in-vitro diagnostic device that we are able to clinically validate, the FDA or another regulatory authority may revise our label for the frontline PTCL indication or in connection with any future approvals to require the use of the in-vitro test as a companion diagnostic. This may limit our ability to commercialize ADCETRIS in the applicable treatment setting due to potential label requirements, prescriber practices, constraints on availability of the diagnostic, or other factors. If Ventana is unable to successfully develop the CD30 in-vitro diagnostic, or experiences delays in doing so, or we experience delays in clinical validation of the diagnostic, we will likely need to renegotiate the timing or content of our post-marketing commitment regarding the in-vitro diagnostic device with the FDA.
Regulations Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we and our collaborators are and will be subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials, manufacturing, distribution and commercial sales of our products. We must obtain approval by the regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in those countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas before we may market products in those countries or areas. For example, to commercialize TUKYSA in Europe, we will need to comply with applicable European regulations. The approval requirements and processes can vary greatly, and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from place to place. 
Clinical Trials Regulation in Europe
In the EU, pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the EU member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the national competent authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of member states. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the independent ethics committee for each site has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the individual EU member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. It is anticipated that the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 may come into effect in late 2021with a three-year transition period for some types of clinical trials. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new regulation, which will be directly applicable in all EU member states, aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. For instance, the new Clinical Trials Regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
Marketing Authorization Regulation in Europe
In the European Economic Area, which is comprised of the 27 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization through one of the following procedures: centralized, mutual recognition, and decentralized. Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, which then makes a recommendation to the EC. The EC makes the final determination on whether to approve the application. The centralized procedure is compulsory for the approval, among others, of human medicines containing a new active substance to treat cancer. The mutual recognition and decentralized procedures provide for mutual recognition of individual national approval decisions and are available for products that are not subject to the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The U.K., following its exit from the EU and EEA, and Switzerland conduct separate regulatory reviews of new drug applications. Until December 31st, 2022, the U.K. will also issue national approvals via “reliance route”, by recognizing the centralized EU approvals of new medicines.
For the EMA, an application designated as standard review typically lasts approximately twelve to fourteen months depending on the length of time sponsors take to address EMA questions. An accelerated assessment procedure is applicable to marketing authorization applications for medicinal products that are expected to be of major public health interest. For applications that receive accelerated assessment designation and are able to remain on this timeline, the review may last approximately seven months depending on the length of time sponsors take to address EMA questions. It is not unusual, however, for applications that receive accelerated assessment designation to revert to standard review if, for example, the EMA has determined that the significance of the questions that the company needs to address would be more appropriate under the standard review timelines. At the end of the review period, EMA will issue an opinion either in support of granting a marketing authorization (positive opinion) or recommending refusal of a marketing authorization (negative opinion). In the event of a negative opinion, the company may request a re-examination of the application. The initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years. Once renewed, the authorization will be valid for an unlimited period, unless the national competent authority or the EC decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. The renewal of a marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities or the EMA.
Post-approval Regulation in Europe
In countries where we receive regulatory approvals, we are subject to a variety of post-authorization regulations, including with respect to clinical studies, product manufacturing, advertising and promotion, distribution, and safety reporting. 
Various requirements apply to the manufacturing and placing of medicinal products on the EU market. The manufacturing of medicinal products in the EU requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, including the manufacture of APIs outside of the EU with the intention to import the APIs into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU member states. Marketing authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU member states’ requirements applicable to the manufacturing of medicinal products.
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to EU member states’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other legislation adopted by individual EU member states may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our future products and impose limitations on promotional activities with health care professionals. 
The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with the EU’s pharmacovigilance legislation, which includes requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance surveillance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. The EMA reviews periodic safety update reports submitted by marketing authorization holders. If the EMA has concerns that the risk-benefit profile of a product has changed, it can adopt an opinion advising that the existing marketing authorization for the product be amended. The agency can also require that the marketing authorization holder conducts post-authorization safety studies. Non-compliance with such obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorization or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.
Healthcare Regulation
U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations are also applicable to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our operations include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, regulations prohibiting off-label promotion activities, and transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively PPACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, or approval by, the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
The FDA and other governmental authorities also actively investigate allegations of off-label promotion activities in order to enforce regulations prohibiting these types of activities. In recent years, private whistleblowers have also pursued False Claims Act cases against a number of pharmaceutical companies for causing false claims to be submitted as a result of off-label promotion. If we are found to have promoted an approved product for off-label uses, we may be subject to significant liability, including significant civil and administrative financial penalties and other remedies as well as criminal penalties and other sanctions. Even when a company is not determined to have engaged in off-label promotion, the allegation from government authorities or market participants that a company has engaged in such activities could have a significant impact on the company’s sales, business and financial condition. The U.S. government has also required companies to enter into complex corporate integrity agreements and/or non-prosecution agreements that impose significant reporting and other burdens on the affected companies.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, PPACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under PPACA and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives during the previous year. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures,” as adjusted for inflation. Covered manufacturers are required to submit reports on aggregate payment data to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on an annual basis.
Many states have similar statutes or regulations to the above federal laws and regulations that may be broader in scope than the aforementioned federal versions and apply regardless of payor, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicating compliance efforts. Additionally, our business operations in countries outside the United States, including Canada and the EU, may subject us to additional regulation. 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations were found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, imprisonment, diminished profits and future earnings, exclusion from participation in government healthcare reimbursement programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
Anti-Corruption Legislation
We are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations that are not specific to the healthcare industry. For instance, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, generally prohibits paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, governmental staff members, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. In Europe, national anti-corruption laws prohibit giving, offering, or promising bribes to any person, including foreign government officials and private persons, as well as requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting bribes from any person. Various European anti-corruption laws have broad extraterritorial reach and therefore we may be subject to those laws even if we do not have an established entity in those countries and we may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including private persons, by employees and persons associated with us in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage. As we expand our footprint and activities outside of the U.S. and Canada, our exposure to compliance risks under the FCPA and other similar laws will likewise increase.
Privacy and Security Laws
There are also numerous privacy and data protection laws to which we are currently, and/or may in the future, be subject. The U.S. federal government, individual U.S. states, EU member countries and other jurisdictions, including Switzerland and Canada, have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the use and international transfer of personal data collected in the EU is governed by the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the control over personal data by individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the documentation we must maintain, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, provides an enforcement authority and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to all types of personal data that we process, including in clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management’s attention and increase our cost of doing business. However, despite our ongoing efforts to bring our practices into compliance with the GDPR, we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control or other factors outside our control. Local data protection authorities can also have different interpretations of the GDPR, leading to potential inconsistencies amongst various EU member states. 
Moreover, one of the primary safeguards allowing U.S. companies to import personal information from Europe has been certification to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. However, the Court of Justice of the EU, or the CJEU, recently invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The same decision also raised questions about whether one of the primary alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, namely, the EC’s Standard Contractual Clauses, provide sufficient protection for personal data transferred from Europe to the U.S. or most other countries without analyzing each transfer and implementing supplementary measures to protect the data. Following recent recommendations from the European Data Protection Board, we are undertaking a review of personal data transfers from the EU and will assess the impact of the CJEU decision on our operations. At present, there are few, if any, viable alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Standard Contractual Clauses. Where appropriate, we rely on individuals’ explicit consent to transfer their personal information from Europe to the U.S. and other countries. In addition, we rely on inter-company Standard Contractual Clauses to provide appropriate safeguards for such transfers. The EC is expected to publish new Standard Contractual Clauses soon and to give companies relying on them for transfers 12 months to adapt. Authorities in Switzerland, whose data protection laws are similar to those of the EU, also invalidated use of the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. Authorities in the United Kingdom, or U.K., may similarly invalidate use of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The U.K.'s departure from the EU, known as Brexit, has created additional uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the U.K., as it is unclear whether the U.K. and EU will be able to negotiate a mutually agreeable data protection agreement that regulates data transfers between the U.K. and EU and what impact this will have on our business. If we are unable to rely on explicit consent to transfer individuals’ personal information from Europe, which can be revoked, or if, upon review by authorities, our existing compliance solutions are found to be insufficient, we will face increased exposure to substantial fines under European data protection laws as well as injunctions against processing personal information from persons resident in Europe. The inability to import personal information from the European Economic Area, U.K. or Switzerland could restrict our clinical trial activities in Europe, limit our ability to collaborate with contract research organizations, service providers, contractors and other companies subject to European data protection laws, interfere with our ability to hire employees in Europe and require us to increase our data processing capabilities in Europe at significant expense. 
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, also imposes certain requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
In any event, our failure or alleged failure (including as a result of deficiencies in our policies, procedures or measures relating to privacy, data protection, marketing or communications) to comply with laws, regulations, policies, legal or contractual obligations, industry standards or regulatory guidance relating to privacy or data protection, may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity. In addition, new regulation, legislative actions or changes in interpretation of existing laws or regulations regarding privacy and data protection (together with applicable industry standards) may increase our costs of doing business. In this regard, we expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which have been characterized as “GDPR-like” privacy laws, and we cannot determine the impact such new laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. 
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of ADCETRIS, PADCEV, TUKYSA and any future products depend, in significant part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatment for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients and providers are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Pharmaceutical products are typically reimbursed based on FDA labeled indications, recognized compendia listings, available medical literature, evidence of favorable clinical outcomes, determination of medical necessity and cost effectiveness.
Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for each of our product candidates is individual to each insurer, can vary based on provider contract, and will be affected by state and federal laws providing for reimbursement formulas based on acquisition cost. Third-party payors continue to work diligently to control their spending on prescription drugs and medical service. The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of the U.S. government and abroad, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and the governments of other countries have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net sales and negatively impact our operating results. Payors, commercial and public in the U.S. and abroad, must review the therapeutic value of our products before extending coverage under their plans to reimburse our products. If third-party payors do not find a product to be of therapeutic value, they may not cover it or, if they do, they may do so at an insufficient level of payment.
Many of the patients in the U.S. who seek treatment with ADCETRIS, PADCEV or TUKYSA may be eligible for Medicare or Medicaid benefits. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and coverage and reimbursement for products and services under these programs are subject to changes in CMS regulations and interpretive policy determinations, in addition to statutory changes made by Congress. For example, PPACA increased the mandated Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. Federal budget decisions have reduced Medicare payment rates, and future budget decisions may reduce Medicare payment rates again. In addition, as a condition of federal funds being made available to cover our products under Medicaid, we are required to participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program. The rebate amount under this program varies by quarter, and is based on pricing data we report to CMS. In addition, because we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program, we must make ADCETRIS, PADCEV and TUKYSA available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration. This requires compliance with additional laws and requirements, including offering ADCETRIS, PADCEV and TUKYSA at a reduced price to federal agencies including the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and United States Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and the Indian Health Service. We are also required to offer discounted pricing to certain eligible not for profit entities that are eligible for 340B pricing under the Public Health Services Act. Participation in these programs requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate our prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, as well as, administrative burdens and exclusion from or contract termination regarding these programs. The terms of these government programs could change in the future which may increase the discounts or rebates we are required to offer, possibly reducing the revenue derived from sales of our products to these entities.
Policies governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. In many European countries, authorities regulate the pricing of a pharmaceutical product at launch or subsequent to launch through direct price controls such as international reference pricing. In addition, in many European countries, pharmaceutical products are funded largely by the national healthcare systems. As a result, patients are unlikely to use a pharmaceutical product that is not reimbursed by the national authorities. There can be no assurance as to the pricing and/or level of reimbursement that may be available for our products in countries with pricing and reimbursement policies in place at the national level. 
Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of pharmaceutical products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in EU member states. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of the applicable country, aims to measure the added value of a new health technology compared to existing ones by assessing its public health impact, therapeutic impact and economic and societal impact in the context and setting of the individual country’s national healthcare system. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost and cost-effectiveness of individual pharmaceutical products in comparison to the local standard of care, as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these pharmaceutical products by the competent authorities of individual EU member states. Pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU member states was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This could lead to harmonization between EU member states of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTA and their impact on pricing and reimbursement decisions.
Healthcare Reform
PPACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. PPACA has, among other things, expanded and increased industry rebates for products covered under Medicaid programs and changed the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. In order for a biopharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the drug pricing program under the Public Health Services Act, or PHS. The required PHS discount on a given product is calculated based on the Average Manufacturers Price, or AMP, and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. PPACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted PHS pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted PHS pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication. In addition, as PHS drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, revisions, including the AMP rule, to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required PHS discount to increase.
There remain judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of PPACA, as well as efforts to repeal or replace PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, the tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Based on the repeal of the individual mandate, in December 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that PPACA is unconstitutional. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the district court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the district court to determine whether the remaining provisions of PPACA are invalid as well. In March 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case, and held oral arguments in November 2020. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is uncertain when a decision will be made. It is also unclear how recent changes to the composition of the U.S. Supreme Court may impact its review of this case, as well as other future cases. With the change in administration, further developments with respect to PPACA are likely.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since PPACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect in April 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
In addition, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a 10-year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023.
As described above in "Coverage and Reimbursement", federal and state legislatures, governments in countries outside the U.S., health agencies and third-party payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care. Legislative and regulatory changes and increasing pressure from social sources are likely to further influence the manner in which our products are priced, prescribed, purchased and reimbursed. For example, the Trump administration put forth a number of proposals aimed at containing prescription drug prices and announced several Executive Orders that sought to implement a number of his administration’s proposals. As a result of the Executive Orders issued by the Trump Administration, the FDA released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, that cleared a path for importation of some Canadian drugs into the U.S. Biological products were excluded from the rule’s definition of “eligible prescription drug,” however TUKYSA may be subject to importation from Canada under this rule, which could negatively affect TUKYSA sales in the U.S. The Biden administration is likely to similarly pursue and implement measures aimed at reducing pharmaceutical drug pricing and containing the cost of healthcare.
Competition
The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Many third parties compete with us in developing various approaches to treating cancer. They include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions and other research organizations.
Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and marketing than we do. In addition, many of these competitors are active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements in anticipation of collecting royalties for use of technology that they have developed. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs.
With respect to ADCETRIS, there are several other FDA approved drugs for its approved indications. BMS’s nivolumab and Merck’s pembrolizumab are approved for the treatment of certain patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and Celgene’s romidepsin and Acrotech Biopharma's’ pralatrexate and belinostat are approved for relapsed or refractory sALCL among other T-cell lymphomas. Kyowa Kirin's mogamulizumab is approved for adult patients with relapsed or refractory mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome. The competition ADCETRIS faces from these and other therapies is intensifying. Additionally, Merck is conducting a phase 3 clinical trial in relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma comparing pembrolizumab with ADCETRIS. An interim analysis of this clinical trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival for pembrolizumab compared with ADCETRIS, resulting in a label expansion to an earlier line of therapy, and we expect increased competition from pembrolizumab in this indication. We are also aware of multiple investigational agents currently being studied that, if successful, may compete with ADCETRIS in the future. Data have also been presented on several developing technologies, including bispecific antibodies and CAR modified T-cell therapies that may compete with ADCETRIS in the future. Further, there are many competing approaches used in the treatment of patients in ADCETRIS’ approved indications, including auto-HSCT, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, combination chemotherapy, clinical trials with experimental agents and single-agent regimens.
With respect to PADCEV, other treatments in pretreated metastatic urothelial cancer include checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy, generic chemotherapy and, for patients with select fibroblast growth factor receptor genetic alterations, Janssen's erdafitinib. There are other investigational agents that, if approved, could be competitive with PADCEV, such as Gilead's’ sacituzumab govitecan, which is in a pivotal phase 2 study. Treatment in frontline metastatic urothelial cancer has traditionally been treated with chemotherapy alone but is evolving to include two checkpoint inhibitor therapies for cisplatin-ineligible patients with high PD-L1 expression or patients who are ineligible for platinum therapy. Several trials of investigational agents in combination with chemotherapy or other novel agents are ongoing. Continued development of PD-(L)1 targeted therapies across early stage bladder cancer and in metastatic bladder cancer in frontline combinations with chemotherapy, in frontline maintenance with the recent approval of avelumab, and in pretreated disease, could potentially impact PADCEV usage and enrollment to PADCEV clinical trials. In addition, the competitive positioning for PADCEV will also depend on, among other things, the extent to which we and Astellas are able to obtain regulatory approvals of PADCEV in additional indications in the U.S., including in the frontline metastatic urothelial cancer setting, and in territories outside the U.S. 
With respect to TUKYSA, there are multiple marketed products which target HER2, including the antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab and the antibody drug conjugate T-DM1. In addition, lapatinib is an EGFR/HER2 oral kinase inhibitor for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and neratinib is an irreversible pan-HER kinase inhibitor indicated for extended adjuvant treatment and has been recently approved for patients who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic setting. Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca have fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, which was recently approved for patients who have received two or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic breast cancer setting and also in HER2 positive gastric cancer. Byondis has an antibody drug conjugate, SYD985, in a pivotal study in this patient population and MacroGenics has a HER2 targeted, Fc-optimized antibody, margetuximab, which was recently approved by the FDA. 
With respect to tisotumab vedotin, in June 2018, Merck’s pembrolizumab was approved for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy in patients whose tumors express PD-L1. We are also aware of other companies that currently have products in development for the treatment of late-stage cervical cancer which could be competitive with tisotumab vedotin, including Agenus, BMS, Iovance Biotherapeutics, Merck, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi-Aventis and Roche. 
Many other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing and/or marketing therapies for the same types of cancer that our product candidates are designed and being developed to treat. For example, we believe that companies including AbbVie, ADC Therapeutics, Affimed, Agios, Amgen, Astellas, Bayer, Biogen, BMS, Celgene, Daiichi Sankyo, Eisai, Genentech, GSK, Gilead, ImmunoGen, Infinity, Janssen, Karyopharm, MacroGenics, MedImmune, MEI Pharma, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer, Puma Biotech, Sanofi-Aventis, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Takeda, Teva, and Xencor are developing and/or marketing products or technologies that may compete with ours. In addition, our ADC collaborators may develop compounds utilizing our technology that may compete with product candidates that we are developing. 
We are aware of other companies that have technologies that may be competitive with ours, including AbbVie, ADC Therapeutics, Astellas, AstraZeneca, BMS, Daiichi Sankyo, Gilead, ImmunoGen, Janssen, MedImmune, Merck, Mersana, Pfizer, Roche, Sutro and Zymeworks, all of which have ADC technology. ImmunoGen has several ADCs in development that may compete with our product candidates. ImmunoGen has also established partnerships with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to allow those other companies to utilize ImmunoGen’s technology, including Sanofi-Aventis, Genentech, Novartis, Takeda and Lilly. We are also aware of a number of companies developing monoclonal antibodies directed at the same antigen targets or for the treatment of the same diseases as our product candidates.
In addition, in the U.S., the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “highly similar” or “biosimilar” to or “interchangeable” with an FDA approved biological product. This pathway allows competitors to reference the FDA’s prior approvals regarding innovative biological products and data submitted with a BLA to obtain approval of a biosimilar application twelve years after the time of approval of the innovative biological product. The twelve-year exclusivity period runs from the initial approval of the innovator product and not from approval of a new indication. In addition, the twelve-year exclusivity period does not prevent another company from independently developing a product that is highly similar to the innovative product, generating all the data necessary for a full BLA and seeking approval. Exclusivity only assures that another company cannot rely on the FDA’s prior approvals in approving a BLA for an innovator’s biological product to support the biosimilar product’s approval. Further, under the FDA’s current interpretation, it is possible that a biosimilar applicant could obtain approval for one or more of the indications approved for the innovator product by extrapolating clinical data from one indication to support approval for other indications. In the EU, the EC has granted marketing authorizations for biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. We are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology and other companies that are actively engaged in research and development of biosimilars or interchangeable products. 
It is possible that our competitors will succeed in developing technologies that are more effective than ADCETRIS, PADCEV, TUKYSA, tisotumab vedotin, or our other product candidates or that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive, or will succeed in developing biosimilar, interchangeable or generic products for ADCETRIS, PADCEV, TUKYSA, tisotumab vedotin or our other product candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition in the future as new companies enter our market and scientific developments surrounding biosimilars and other cancer therapies continue to accelerate. We cannot predict to what extent the entry of biosimilars or other competing products will impact potential future sales of ADCETRIS, PADCEV, TUKYSA, tisotumab vedotin, or our other product candidates.
With respect to our current and potential future product candidates, we believe that our ability to compete effectively and develop products that can be manufactured cost-effectively and marketed successfully will depend on our ability to:
•advance our technology platforms;
•license additional technology;
•complete clinical trials which position our products for regulatory and commercial success;
•maintain a proprietary position in our technologies and products;
•obtain required government and other public and private approvals on a timely basis;
•attract and retain key personnel;
•commercialize effectively;
•obtain reimbursement for our products in approved indications;
•comply with applicable laws, regulations and regulatory requirements and restrictions with respect to the commercialization of our products, including with respect to any changed or increased regulatory restrictions; and
•enter into additional collaborations to advance the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
Manufacturing
ADCETRIS
We rely on contract manufacturing organizations to supply ADCETRIS for our clinical trials and for commercial sale. For the monoclonal antibody used in ADCETRIS, we have contracted with AbbVie for clinical and commercial supplies. For the drug linker used in ADCETRIS, we have contracted with Millipore Sigma, a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, for clinical and commercial supplies. We have multiple contract manufacturers for conjugating the drug linker to the antibody and producing ADCETRIS drug product. In addition, we rely on other third parties to supply the raw materials used to produce ADCETRIS, and to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process, including storage and distribution of ADCETRIS and our product candidates. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce, store and distribute sufficient quantities of ADCETRIS for use in our clinical trials and for commercial sale. 
AbbVie Biotechnology. In 2004, we entered into a development and supply agreement with AbbVie (formerly a part of Abbott Laboratories) to manufacture developmental, clinical and commercial quantities of anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, which is a component of ADCETRIS. The agreement generally provides for the supply by AbbVie and the purchase by us of such anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody. Under terms of the supply agreement, we may purchase a portion of our required anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody from a second source third-party supplier. We are required to make a minimum annual purchase. The anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody is purchased by us based upon a rolling forecast. The supply agreement will continue until 2025 with an automatic one-year term extension unless either party provides written termination notice to the other party. Either party has the right to terminate the supply agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations thereunder.
Millipore Sigma. In 2010, we entered into a commercial supply agreement with Sigma Aldrich Fine Chemicals, or SAFC, which was subsequently acquired by Millipore Sigma, an affiliate of Merck KGaA. Under this agreement, Millipore Sigma manufactures commercial quantities of the drug linker that is a component of ADCETRIS. Under terms of the supply agreement, we may purchase a portion of our required drug linker from a second source third-party supplier. We are required to make a minimum annual purchase. The drug linker is purchased by us based upon a rolling forecast. The supply agreement will continue until 2029 with automatic term extension unless either party provides written notice of termination to the other party. Either party has the right to terminate the supply agreement if the other party materially breaches its obligations thereunder. 
PADCEV
Under the terms of our collaboration and commercialization agreements with Astellas, we rely on Astellas to provide commercial and clinical supply of PADCEV. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on Astellas and other third parties to produce, store and distribute sufficient quantities of PADCEV for commercial sale and for use in our clinical trials. We believe that the existing supplies of PADCEV and Astellas' contract manufacturing relationships will be sufficient to accommodate current commercial and clinical needs. However, we or Astellas may need to obtain additional manufacturing arrangements or increase manufacturing capability to meet potential future commercial needs with respect to PADCEV, which could require additional capital investment by us or cause us potential delays if Astellas or we encounter challenges in negotiating commercially reasonable arrangements with these manufacturers. In particular, we are responsible for establishing a second source supply chain for PADCEV, whether through internal or third party sources.
TUKYSA
With respect to TUKYSA, we rely on multiple contract manufacturers and other third parties to perform manufacturing services for us including Sterling Pharma Solutions Limited, or Sterling, for production of the starting materials for TUKYSA, Esteve Quimica, S.A., or Esteve to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient, Hovione to complete spray drying and Corden Plankstadt to produce the tablets for TUKYSA. In 2020, we entered into commercial supply agreements with each of Sterling, Esteve Quimica and Corden, and are in the process of negotiating a commercial supply agreement with Hovione. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and other third parties to produce and store sufficient quantities of TUKYSA. We have limited prior experience as an organization manufacturing TUKYSA and small molecule drug products generally, and we have relatively new working relationships with many of the third party manufacturers involved in TUKYSA manufacture. While we believe that the existing supplies of TUKYSA will be sufficient to accommodate current clinical and forecasted commercial needs at this time, we expect that we will need to put in place additional manufacturing arrangements or expand our current manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers to meet potential future commercial needs and while we are currently negotiating those arrangements, we cannot assure you that we can enter into such arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all.
Sterling. We have a commercial supply agreement with Sterling to manufacture starting materials for TUKYSA. The agreement provides that we will purchase starting materials pursuant to rolling forecasts and will purchase a minimum percentage of our requirements for the starting materials from Sterling. The agreement will remain in effect until 2025, after which it will continue automatically for up to two additional years subject to termination by either party giving written notice to the other party. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement if the other party commits any breach of the agreement and does not remedy, make a bona fide attempt to remedy or enter into negotiations to resolve, the breach after notice to do so, if capable of remedy. 
Esteve Quimica. Our commercial supply agreement with Esteve provides that we will order the active pharmaceutical agreement for TUKYSA pursuant to rolling forecasts. The agreement will remain in effect until 2025, after which it will automatically renew subject to termination by us by giving written notice to Esteve. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement if the other party fails to cure a material breach. 
Corden. We have a commercial supply agreement with Corden to produce TUKYSA tablets. The agreement provides that we will order pursuant to rolling forecasts and will purchase a minimum percentage of our requirements from Corden. The agreement will remain in effect until 2025, after which it will be renewed if not terminated with written notice prior to the expiration of the term. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement if the other party commits a breach and does not cure or commence and diligently continue actions to cure such default. 
Product Candidates
For the clinical supply of our product candidates, we rely on multiple contract manufacturers and other third parties to perform manufacturing services for us. In 2017, we acquired a biologics manufacturing facility located in Bothell, Washington. While we use the facility to support our clinical supply needs, for the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers for much of the supply of our product candidates for our clinical trials. With respect to tisotumab vedotin, we currently rely on drug product supply provided by Genmab and have little control over their supply chains or the contract manufacturers Genmab utilizes. For the near-term, we expect to continue to rely on Genmab for manufacturing of clinical supplies of tisotumab vedotin. Under the commercialization agreement we entered into with Genmab in October 2020, we will be responsible for overseeing the clinical and commercial manufacturing supply chain of tisotumab vedotin following a transition period. We will need to obtain appropriate manufacturing arrangements and increase manufacturing capability to meet potential future commercial needs, and could experience potential delays if we encounter challenges in negotiating commercially reasonable arrangements with manufacturers or in transitioning oversight of the manufacturing process from Genmab to us.
Commercial Operations
We have allocated commercial resources, including sales, marketing, supply chain management and reimbursement capabilities, to commercialize ADCETRIS and TUKYSA in the U.S. and Canada, and PADCEV in the U.S. We believe the U.S. market for ADCETRIS, PADCEV, and TUKYSA in their approved indications, and Canadian market for ADCETRIS and TUKYSA in their approved indications, are addressable with a targeted sales and marketing organization. We intend to continue promoting our products in the U.S. and Canada for these and any additional indications we may obtain in the future. Takeda has commercial rights for ADCETRIS in the rest of the world. Takeda has received marketing authorizations by regulatory authorities for ADCETRIS in more than 75 countries outside North America, and Takeda continues to pursue marketing authorizations in other countries.
In the U.S., we sell ADCETRIS, PADCEV, and TUKYSA through a limited number of specialty distributors. Three of our major distributors, together with entities under their common control—AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and McKesson Corporation—each accounted for 10% or more of our total net product sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018. We also sell TUKYSA to a limited number of specialty pharmacies. 
Health care providers purchase ADCETRIS, PADCEV, and TUKYSA through these specialty distributors and the product is drop shipped directly to the health care provider. ADCETRIS and PADCEV are infused products and generally shipped directly to health care providers and facilities for administration to patients. TUKYSA is an oral product ordered by prescription and typically dispensed to patients by the network specialty pharmacies, at physician in-office dispensing sites, or by hospital/Integrated Delivery Network pharmacies.
In Europe, we have allocated commercial resources, including sales, marketing, supply chain management and reimbursement capabilities, to support the anticipated TUKYSA commercial launches in Europe, subject to obtaining the required regulatory and pricing and reimbursement approvals.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had 2,092 employees. Of these employees, 1,246 were engaged in or support research, development and clinical activities, 382 were in administrative and business related positions, and 464 were in sales and marketing. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion is a key element to discovering, developing, and bringing transformative therapies to patients with cancer. As of the end of 2020, 57% of our global workforce and 37% of our leadership (at the executive director level and above) were female. In addition, as of the end of 2020, 33% of our U.S. workforce and 36% of our U.S. leadership (at the executive director level and above) were racially or ethnically diverse. We strive to build a workforce representative of the people we serve and to nurture an inclusive culture where all voices are welcomed, heard, and respected. In 2020, we adopted additional initiatives to further build our capacity to meet our diversity, equity and inclusion goals.
Recruiting and Retention
We believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining talented personnel to support our expanding business, though competition for personnel in our industry is intense. We monitor recruiting efforts using a variety of metrics such as internal placement rates, cycle times, cost per hire, information on the retention of business critical hires (such as medical directors and executives), and the percentage of budgeted openings filled on time and on budget. We also track voluntary and involuntary turnover rates for the company as a whole, for business-critical talent and by gender, race or ethnicity, time in role and job level.
Compensation and Benefits
We offer competitive pay and benefits designed to attract and retain exceptional talent and drive company performance. In setting appropriate compensation levels, we look at the average base pay rate for each position based on market data. At the time of our last annual compensation review, effective February 2020, for regular employees who were eligible for a pay increase, the average ratio of base pay to this market rate was 100%. We also offer an annual cash incentive program, a sales incentive program and long-term equity incentive plans designed to assist in attracting, retaining and motivating employees and promoting the creation of long-term value for stockholders.
Our standard employee benefits in the U.S. include paid and unpaid leaves, medical, dental and vision insurance coverage, a 401(k) plan, short- and long-term disability, life insurance, flexible spending accounts and an employee stock purchase plan. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select options that meet their needs, including telehealth, an employee assistance program, backup childcare, adoption assistance, a travel solution for nursing mothers, education assistance, fitness reimbursements, and wellness programs. We benchmark our benefits program against others in our industry on an annual basis. In addition, in 2020, we conducted an anonymous survey of U.S. employees focused on employee engagement and satisfaction with our total rewards programs.
Succession Planning and Leadership Development 
We establish retention plans for our executives and other business-critical talent and review their total compensation and unvested equity annually. Succession, development, and retention plans for our executive officers are reviewed at the Board level. In addition, we hold company-wide talent-planning reviews both at the executive and departmental levels. To help accelerate the development of leaders across the company, we have established the Seagen Leadership Academy, a program that provides training, leadership opportunities, mentorship and support to high-potential talent at the director level and above. 
COVID-19
We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We have established a cross-functional COVID-19 working group, which meets periodically to discuss policies and protocols, strategic planning, business continuity, and other matters relating to the pandemic. We have made proactive efforts designed to protect the health and safety of our workforce, patients, and healthcare professionals, and to continue our business operations so we can advance our goal of bringing important medicines to patients. As part of these efforts, we instituted a mandatory work-from-home policy for employees who can perform their jobs offsite. 
We are continuing essential research, manufacturing, and laboratory activities onsite and maintain a number of additional precautionary measures designed to protect our onsite employees. These measures include temperature checks, screening protocols, masks, social distancing, contact tracing, and making testing available. We also monitor the progress of our essential onsite activities for impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our field-based personnel have paused most in-person customer interactions in healthcare settings and have been using primarily electronic communications to support healthcare professionals and patients. They are engaging in limited in-person interactions where state and local laws and regulations allow, the institution or office is accepting in-person interactions and our field-based personnel are comfortable engaging in-person with healthcare providers. 
We believe that the measures we have implemented are appropriate and are helping to reduce transmission of COVID-19, and we will continue to monitor conditions and related guidance from governmental authorities and adjust our activities as appropriate.
