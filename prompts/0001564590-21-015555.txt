 Lands' End is a leading uni-channel retailer of casual clothing, accessories, footwear and home products. Operating out of America’s heartland, we believe our vision and values make a strong connection with our core customers. We offer products online at www.landsend.com, on third party online marketplaces and through our own Company Operated stores, as well as, third-party retail locations. We are a classic American lifestyle brand with a passion for quality, legendary service and real value.  We seek to deliver timeless style for women, men, kids and the home.

Lands' End was founded in 1963 by Gary Comer and his partners to sell sailboat hardware and equipment by catalog. While our product focus has shifted significantly over the years, we have continued to adhere to our founder's motto as one of our guiding principles: “Take care of the customer, take care of the employee and the rest will take care of itself.”
 Lands’ End seeks to provide a common customer experience regardless of whether they are interacting with us on our company websites, third-party marketplaces, at Company Operated stores or other distribution channels.  
 We have one external reportable segment and identify our operating segments according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated. Our operating segments consist of: U.S. eCommerce, Lands’ End Outfitters (“Outfitters”), Europe eCommerce, Japan eCommerce, Third Party, and Retail. We have determined that each of our operating segments share similar economic and other qualitative characteristics, and therefore, the results of our operating segments are aggregated into one external reportable segment.
 Product Channels
 Lands’ End identifies five separate distribution channels for revenue reporting purposes:
 U.S. eCommerce offers products through the Company's eCommerce website utilizing digital marketing and direct mail catalogs. 
 International offers products primarily to consumers located in Europe and Japan through eCommerce international websites and third-party affiliates.
 Outfitters sells products to end consumers, primarily located in the U.S., through negotiated arrangements to make specific styles or customized products available to employees and members of client organizations, as well as through the Company's eCommerce websites. 
 Third Party sells the same products as U.S. eCommerce but to domestic wholesale customers or direct to consumers through third-party marketplaces and websites.
 Retail sells products and services through Company Operated stores.
 In Fiscal 2020, we generated revenue of approximately $1.43 billion. Our revenue is generated worldwide with operations based in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Japan. This network reinforces and supports sales across the channels in which we do business. Net revenue is presented by product channel in the following table:

Strategy
 In Fiscal 2020, we continued to leverage our iconic American brand, which was founded on the principles of delivering great quality, uncompromising service and exceptional value to our customers. We are a vertically integrated retailer that manages most aspects of our design, marketing and distribution in-house. In Fiscal 2021, we plan to continue to focus on our five strategic pillars, as we have over the past several years:
 Product. The soul of the Lands’ End brand has always been products with a purpose. We are focused on delivering key items made of quality materials, in iconic styles that offer great value to our customers and their families. We provide an assortment of products leveraging our key item strategy with a focus on delivering comfort, style and value with emphasis on major categories, such as swimwear and outerwear. In addition, we have increased our focus on inclusivity.  We have done this by providing apparel in extended sizes, from petite to plus for women and big and tall for men. In Fiscal 2021, we plan to continue to leverage customer data to drive decisions around our merchandise assortment, fabrics, silhouettes and price points that our customer desires. We have worked to drive consistency in our fit across multiple categories and classifications. We are also focused on key relationships, providing innovative products to meet the needs of our partners.
 Digital. We are focused on utilizing digital technologies to obtain new customers and continuously improve the overall customer experience. This is done by leveraging data analytics to better tailor and personalize the shopping experience for each customer. We are a digitally led organization, applying technology as we adapt to ongoing shifts in customer shopping behaviors. During Fiscal 2020, we leveraged advanced data analytics and machine learning in our effort to optimize gross profit through product level promotions and to optimize both internal and external search capabilities. We enhanced our website with a “test and learn” process which led to improvements in product detail pages and checkout with a focus on the smartphone experience. As part of our Fiscal 2021 initiatives, we plan to continue to leverage artificial intelligence to analyze customer behavior and optimize promotions.
 Distribution. We utilize uni-channel distribution including eCommerce and our own Company Operated stores, as well as, third-party retail stores, to engage our customer where and how they choose to shop. Our 31 Company Operated stores represent the Lands’ End American Heritage aesthetic, making it easy for our customers to find our products in an inviting, brand appropriate setting. Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumers’ shopping habits, which has driven more consumers to shop online rather than in a store, we do not anticipate opening more Company Operated stores in the immediate future. We do, however, plan to pursue opportunities to partner with other brick and mortar and online retailers to increase exposure of our products to more consumers. In Fiscal 2020, we launched nearly all our products for purchase on Kohl’s website, as well as, an 
 4


assortment of products in 150 Kohl’s retail stores and plan to expand to approximately 300 Kohl’s retail stores in Fiscal 2021. For Fiscal 2021, we plan to continue applying a customer analytics-driven distribution strategy, where we leverage our data to refine product assortment and expand opportunities with third-party marketplaces and traditional wholesale.
 Business Processing. We continue to focus on building strategic competencies through improved business processes that are based on standardization and efficiency. During 2019 and 2020, we focused on optimizing our business processing capabilities which further enabled us to upgrade the way we accept, process and fulfill orders across our channels and improve how we interface with our partners. Because of our optimization, we are upgrading our inventory planning process and data analytic capabilities as we focus on growing the business and operating as a global uni-channel retailer. During 2021, we plan to begin a multi-year project to implement a warehouse management solution designed to improve our distribution center operations.  See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Be a Great Place to Work.  Lands’ End strives to be a great place to work, while fostering an inclusive culture where our employees can develop and grow professionally and contribute to our collective success. During 2020, we built on our existing training and development programs and launched many employee initiatives, including our Diversity & Inclusion Council and our Business Resource Groups.
History
 We were founded in 1963, incorporated in Delaware in 1986, and our common stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange from 1986 to 2002. On June 17, 2002, we became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sears Roebuck and Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Sears Holdings. Sears Holdings distributed 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of Lands' End to its stockholders on April 4, 2014 and our common stock was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market.
 Lands' End was founded on certain principles of doing business that are embodied in our goal to deliver great quality, uncompromising service and exceptional value to our customers. Lands’ End founder Gary Comer was quoted as saying: “Take care of the customer, take care of the employee and the rest will take care of itself."
 Competition
 We operate primarily in the apparel industry which is highly competitive. We compete with a diverse group of direct-to-consumer companies and retailers, including national department store chains, women's and men's specialty apparel chains, outdoor specialty stores, apparel catalog businesses, sportswear marketers and online apparel businesses that sell similar lines of merchandise. We compete principally on the basis of merchandise value (quality and price), product innovation, our established customer file and award-winning customer service.
Seasonality
 We experience seasonal fluctuations in our net revenue and operating results and historically have realized a significant portion of our net revenue and earnings for the year during our fourth fiscal quarter. We generated 37.7%, 37.9% and 34.6% of our net revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of Fiscal 2020, Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Thus, lower than expected fourth quarter net revenue could have an adverse impact on our annual operating results.  See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Working capital requirements typically increase during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, working capital requirements typically decrease during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during that period.

Intellectual Property
 Lands' End owns or has rights to use certain word and design trademarks, service marks, and trade names that are registered or exist under common law in the United States and other jurisdictions. The Lands' End® trade name and trademark are used both in the United States and internationally and are material to our business. Trademarks that are important in identifying and distinguishing our products and services are Let’s Get Comfy™, Lands’ End Lighthouse®, Square Rigger™, Squall®, Super-T™, Drifter™, Outrigger®, Marinac®, and Beach Living®, all of which are owned by us, as well as the licensed marks Supima®, No-Gape®, and others. Other recognized trademarks owned by Lands' End include, Starfish™, Iron Knees®, Hyde Park®, Year’ Rounder®, ClassMate®, Willis & Geiger® and ThermaCheck®. Lands' End's rights to some of these trademarks are limited to select markets.
Product Design and Merchandising
 We seek to develop new, innovative products for our customers by utilizing modern fabrics and quality construction to create timeless, affordable styles with excellent fit. We also seek to present our products in an engaging and inspiring way. We believe that our typical customers expect quality, seek good value for their money and are looking to add classics to their wardrobe while also placing an emphasis on comfort, functionality and product innovation that supports their lifestyle. From a design and merchandising perspective, we believe that we have experienced success adding relevant items into our product assortment, many of which have become customer favorites. We devote significant time and resources to quality assurance, fit testing and product compliance. Our in-house team manages all product specifications and seeks to ensure brand integrity by providing our customers with the consistent, high-quality merchandise for which Lands' End is known. Our strategy includes four major themes: own the weather; own the water; layers, layers, layers; and we fit every body. These, inclusive with our overall message on comfort and great value, resonated well during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially with more people staying at home.
Inventory Planning
 Inventory planning seeks to determine optimal inventory levels that align with merchandising and marketing plans and initiatives. The team also supports efforts to maximize product margin through active management of in-season promotions and post-season clearance activities. In addition, Inventory Planning partners with our Sourcing team through long range planning efforts designed to reduce supply chain costs.
 Consistent with our merchandising strategy we make inventory investments intended to support the growth of key products. In addition, through continued assortment and inventory management we are striving to reduce inventory levels and increase seasonal sell through. We recently launched new technology solutions to assist us in these strategic initiatives.  
 Sourcing and Vendors
 Our products are produced globally by independent manufacturers who are selected, monitored and coordinated by our Global Sourcing team based in Wisconsin and Hong Kong, as well as other third-party buying agents. Our products are manufactured in approximately 29 countries and the majority are imported from Asia and South America, depending on the nature of the product mix. In Fiscal 2020, our top 10 vendors accounted for approximately 41% of our merchandise purchases and we worked with approximately 140 vendors that manufactured substantially all our products. We generally do not enter into long term merchandise supply contracts. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to more efficiently source our products worldwide, consistent with our high standards of quality and value. Significant areas of non-product spend include transportation, information systems, marketing, packaging and catalog paper and print. For most of our products, we assume ownership at the port of the vendor’s manufacturing facility. We use third-party shipping companies to transport the product to our facilities. Our reliance on imported products has certain risks around port congestion, transportation delays and heightened security measures that could affect timely deliveries of product to our points of distribution. In the fourth 
 6


quarter 2020 and into the first quarter 2021, we have experienced some delivery delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 It is important to us that our partners share the same values in business as we do, therefore, we require that the vendors comply with applicable legal requirements, agree to our global compliance requirements and meet our product quality standards. Our vendors are required to provide us with full access to their facilities and to relevant records relating to their employment practices, such as, but not limited to, child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, freedom of association, unlawful inducements, safe and healthy working conditions and other business practices so that we may monitor their compliance with ethical and legal requirements relating to the conduct of their business.  See also Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Corporate Citizenship
 Lands' End is working towards improving its sustainable footprint through key practices like waste reduction, purchasing recycled consumables and corporate partnerships. Lands' End hopes to inspire customers and other corporations to increase sustainability awareness and initiatives.
 We have a focus on raising awareness and educating associates on reducing our internal use of consumables and natural resources. In addition, we have a broad range of recycling and waste management initiatives at our corporate office and distribution centers.  For example, we have addressed our use and recycling of paper products, aluminum cans, glass, electronics and plastic, as well as disposal of non-recyclables with composting and effective water management.
 Lands’ End also participates in industry educational workshops and initiatives. We have formed strategic relationships with organizations like the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, bluesign, National Forest Foundation, where we have helped plant over 1 million trees, and the Clean Lakes Alliance, where we help protect and improve maintenance of local lakes in Wisconsin. These alliances, which respectively operate globally, nationally, and locally, allow us to engage at a variety of levels.
 Marketing
 We believe that our most important asset is our brand. The Lands' End brand is well-recognized with a deeply rooted tradition of offering excellent quality, value and service. Lands' End is an iconic American brand with a large and loyal customer base. Operating out of Wisconsin, in the heartland of the United States, we believe our vision and values make a strong connection with our core customer. We believe that a key indicator of our success to date has been the continued growth of our customer file, with increases in new and active customers. 
 We also invest significantly in brand development through our focus on providing excellent customer service, emphasis on digital transformation and innovative product development. We believe that this commitment to our brand has helped to generate our large and loyal customer base for over fifty years.
 We attempt to build on our brand recognition through our “Let’s Get Comfy” tagline in multi-channel marketing campaigns including through our eCommerce website, www.landsend.com, catalog distribution, digital marketing and social media. Creative designs for these marketing platforms are developed in-house by our creative team. We strive to be efficient in our overall spend, enabling us to invest in initiatives that we believe will yield benefits over the longer term. We believe we will generate near term return on investment with most of our marketing spend allocated to digital marketing and our catalog. The catalog continues to be a productive vehicle to drive customers to our website and Company Operated stores. We are also seeking to enhance our branding initiatives by investing in strategic relationships with other brands, public personalities and online influencers designed to showcase our apparel.
 Customer Service
 We are committed to building on Lands' End's legacy of strong customer service. We believe we have a strong track record of improving the customer service experience through innovation. Lands' End is focused on using our extensive customer data to make the shopping experience as effortless and personalized as possible, regardless of 
 7


whether our customers shop online or in one of our Company Operated store locations. Our operations include a return policy that is frequently mentioned as one of the best in the industry, service agents who are available through Company Operated store locations, on the phone, via chat, email or social media, and an ever-evolving digital self-service platform. These all have contributed to our award-winning customer service, which we believe is one of our core strengths and a key point of differentiation from our competitors. We have received many accolades over the years and most recently, received the following:
  
• | Lands’ End was included in the Newsweek list of America’s Best Customer Service in 2021, 2020, and 2019. Ranking No.1 for best customer service in the Online Retailers: Clothing in the Apparel category (November 2020, November 2019, and November 2018)

• | Lands’ End was included in the Newsweek list of Best Online Shops 2020 (September 2019)

Distribution
 We own and operate two distribution centers and one embroidery operation facility in Wisconsin. Our Dodgeville facility is approximately 1.1 million square feet and is a full-service distribution center, offering monogramming, hemming and embroidery services. Our Reedsburg location is approximately 400,000 square feet and offers all order fulfillment services except hemming. Our Stevens Point distribution center is approximately 150,000 square feet and primarily focuses on embroidery services. Our customer orders are shipped via third party carriers.
 We own and operate a distribution center in the United Kingdom based in Oakham, a community north of London. Our Oakham facility opened in 1998 and is approximately 175,000 square feet. It is a full-service distribution center, including monogramming, hemming and embroidery services for our European businesses. In September 2020, this facility was approved as a Customs warehouse which provides certain cash flow benefits resulting from deferred customs duties and simplification of imports and returns to and from the European Union. 
 Additionally, we lease a 56,000 square foot distribution center in Fujieda, Japan.
 Orders are filled on a current basis and order backlog is not material to our business. 
 Information Technology
 Our information technology systems provide comprehensive support for the design, merchandising, importing, marketing, distribution, sales, order processing and order fulfillment of our Lands' End products. We have a dedicated information technology team that provides strategic direction, application development, infrastructure services and systems support for the functions and processes of our business. The information technology team contracts with third party consulting firms to provide cost-effective staff augmentation services and leverages leading hardware, software and cloud-based technology firms to provide the infrastructure necessary to run and operate our systems. Our core software applications are a combination of internally developed and packaged third-party systems. The eCommerce solutions powering www.landsend.com, the Outfitters websites, and our international Lands' End websites are operated out of our own internal data centers, as well as through hosting relationships with third parties and industry-leading cloud providers.
 We are in the process of implementing new information technology systems as part of a multi-year plan to expand and upgrade our platforms and infrastructure. We intend to build off these core systems to drive future improvements in our operations including efficiencies within our internal processes and reporting. While we focus on customer facing system improvements, we are also pursuing implementation of warehouse management tools designed to improve warehouse efficiencies and cost-effective third-party delivery to our customer. Implementation of new systems is highly dependent on coordination of numerous software, hardware, cloud and system integration providers.

Human Capital Management
 Philosophy and Approach

 Since our founding in 1963, Lands’ End has recognized that our people are a critical asset. People, the individuals we employ, the customers we serve, and their families, are the heart of our company. We are committed to creating an inspiring culture that is welcoming, safe and inclusive for all who work and shop with us.
 Aligning with our overall message of comfort, our desire is to create “A More Comfortable World” with initiatives focused on our employees, our customers and our planet. Perhaps most telling, at Lands’ End the human resources department has been named “Employee Services” since its early days.  This reinforces the message of our founder, Gary Comer “The really important thing that makes Lands’ End what it has become is people. You, me, everyone around us. It is what we do as people that makes this a great place to come to work”.
 We employ approximately 5,300 employees throughout our operations: approximately 4,400 employees in the United States and approximately 900 employees outside the United States. This workforce consists of approximately 18% salaried employees, 38% hourly employees and 44% part-time employees. With the seasonal nature of the fourth quarter holiday shopping season in the retail industry, approximately 2,000 additional, flexible, part-time employees join us each year to support our call and distribution centers. 
 Recruitment and Retention 
 Lands’ End leverages a multi-prong recruitment approach to source and hire top talent aligned with our corporate priorities. We maintain a strong digital presence to represent our brand and proactively target talent, in addition to a meaningful employee referral bonus program. We have annual talent review processes in place to regularly evaluate and align on high potential talent with development actions that prepare employees for internal promotion and career growth opportunities, including succession planning for management positions. 
 Lands’ End has an open-door philosophy. We regularly conduct anonymous employee opinion surveys to seek feedback from all employment classifications on a variety of topics, including confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and feedback on how we could improve our efforts to be an even greater place to work. Results are shared company wide, along with actions to drive meaningful improvements. Our efforts to retain talent and maintain strong employee engagement have been very effective, as evidenced by 43% of our employee base having a tenure of 10 years or more.  
 Turnover within our workforce is closely monitored to alert management of potential issues aside from our normal and desired turnover. Our 3-year average global salaried turnover rate is 12%, and the turnover rate for our hourly full-time staff is approximately 10%, which we believe compares favorably in the marketplace. We maintain a strong focus on employee retention through regular and consistent communication, periodic pulse surveys and continued emphasis on employee personal health and safety.
 Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
 The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on our employees in 2020. Since mid-March 2020, we have operated primarily in a remote work environment for our corporate (non-operational) employees. This has required an increased reliance on technology, in the form of teleconferencing, and driven innovations in the way tasks are accomplished and work gets done. During this period, management had increased its focus and emphasis on communication and cross-functional cooperation to compensate for the loss of informal day-to-day interaction in the office setting.
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took various actions that impacted our employees, including furloughs, temporary pay reductions, temporary suspension of 401(k) Company matching contribution and cancellation of budgeted merit-based salary increases.
 We established a task force composed of a cross-functional group of senior management to continually assess the work from home impact. This task force has conducted employee pulse surveys and solicited input on work 
 9


models for the future. We believe that when the COVID-19 pandemic ends, some functions will operate in a hybrid model that combines work from home with work from office, as opposed to the traditional “five days a week in the office” model. We are focused on monitoring employee satisfaction, formal and informal employee training and development needs, efficiencies to be gained or lost through a non-traditional work environment, the impact on corporate culture and overall business and financial performance in order to determine the model that best suits the Company, our shareholders and our customer needs. 
 Diversity and Inclusion 
 As we strive to be a great place to work, we have developed and implemented key initiatives around diversity and inclusion. While we believe Lands’ End has always espoused these values in the past, due to the heightened awareness of social issues during the summer of 2020, we determined that we could do more, and a renewed focus and prioritization was in order. We believe our strength in work and life comes from the combination of our unique experiences, backgrounds, and talents. We established a Diversity & Inclusion Council (“D&I Council”) consisting of employees who come from diverse backgrounds, with Lands’ End’s Chief Executive Officer serving as the executive sponsor. The D&I Council oversees programming designed to celebrate diversity and foster awareness of all perspectives. To that end, the D&I Council established training modules, which are required of all employees, and launched a relevant speaker series. The D&I Council maintains a prominent online presence within the Company’s intranet through which it communicates with all employees across a wide range of subjects, including the recognition of important days with various cultures and educational materials in support of building greater awareness and appreciation of our individual stories, experiences and lives.
 We have also established Business Resource Groups (“BRGs”) to provide support for our employees. The BRGs are employee-led and consist of individuals with common interests, backgrounds or demographic factors such as gender, race or ethnicity. We currently have five groups: Lands’ End Pride (LGTBQ+), Lands’ End Working Parents, Lands’ End Employees with Disabilities and Allies, Lands’ End Veterans and Lands’ End Multicultural. The groups are open to all employees, including allies who want to be supportive and involved. In establishing the BRGs, we are reinforcing our message of inclusion and hope to further empower our employees to utilize their voice to make Lands’ End welcoming, understanding and stronger. 
 The Employee Services team has been working to evolve key processes to support more diverse and inclusive hiring practices. We are developing strategies to extend our reach by targeting areas of country and industry groups that have top diverse talent along with aligning with diverse business organizations that are in line with our overall brand strategy. In addition, we are committed to support recruitment free of bias, educating our interview panels and tracking progress to identify areas of improvement. 
 Compensation and Benefits
 We have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages and are committed to a total compensation program that is competitive for our type of business and within the markets where we operate. We also aim to pay employees equitably who are performing in similar roles. When making compensation decisions, Lands’ End considers compensation market data primarily focused on apparel retail companies and other related industries. In addition to paying competitive salaries and wages, Lands’ End has various compensation awards and programs in place for all employees based on their position, such as annual incentive plans, equity awards, sales incentive plans, peak incentives and discretionary bonuses based on company performance.
 We offer a comprehensive benefit package to all eligible employees. In the U.S. these include the following, among other benefits:
