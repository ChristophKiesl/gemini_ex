 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
  
  History and Development of Business
  
  GEX Management, Inc. was originally formed in 2004 as Group Excellence Management, LLC. d/b/a MyEasyHQ. In March of 2016, it was converted from a limited liability company into a corporation and changed its name to GEX Management, Inc. in April of 2016.
  
  Carl Dorvil founded a company called Group Excellence, LLC out of his dorm room at Southern Methodist University in 2004. Group Excellence provided tutoring and mentoring to students with the goal of inspiring kids to achieve excellence. The company quickly grew to more than six hundred employees. Through this rapid growth, midway through 2004, Mr. Dorvil realized that he had two businesses on his hands. One was the tutoring and mentoring business, and the other was the back-office business that was handling the day-to-day operations of his company. This back-office business provided Group Excellence, LLC with human resources, IT, accounting/bookkeeping, social media, payroll, and conducted a majority of the overall operations of the company and became GEX Management. Mr. Dorvil sold his tutoring business, Group Excellence, LLC, in 2011 but continued to own and operate GEX Management, which continued as a Professional Services Company that provided back office support to the tutoring company, as well as third-parties that needed these services. In 2016 GEX restructured its business model in order to provide staffing and back office services in order to expand the Company’s offerings, and to provide the same quality of support that it has for the last twelve years to its clients.

  Business Strategy
  
  Our objective is to become a leading back office and general business consulting company, and continuously grow our client base. We plan to achieve this objective by continuing to implement our business strategy, which includes the primary elements we discuss below.
 Marketing and Sales
  
  Our marketing efforts target small and mid-sized businesses that have the need for the types of services that we provide, but cannot afford full time employees to handle those services. One of our fastest growing customer segments is the marketing and consultancy businesses. The Company began focusing on these industries in its third and fourth quarters because of the need for cost effective staffing and back office solutions due to the cyclical nature of those industries. In the past we have generated a significant amount of our revenues through client referrals and our management’s personal relationships. We plan to continue to grow through these relationships and reach a wider audience through social media advertising and marketing channels to accelerate client and sales growth.
 Dependence on Major Customers
  
  We rely heavily on the service contract renewals of our clients. Our management is responsible for developing and maintaining successful long-term relationships with key clients. In 2015 and 2016 we had 4 to 5 main customers that made up approximately 80% of our revenues.

  Our Qualifications
  
  Our qualifications include our reputation as a Professional Services Company with specific experience in the back office services general business consulting since 2004.
  
  Industry and Competitors
  
  The back office and employee/employer administration industry, including the Professional Employer Organizations (PEO) and Administrative Services Organizations (ASO), is highly fragmented, resulting in intense competition. Competition affects our ability to succeed in both the market segments we currently serve and new market segments that we may enter in the future. We compete with several large back office and administration companies, as well as PEOs and ASOs that provide the same services we provide, but also provide additional services. These companies may have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. Competition in our industry is based primarily on quality of service to the customer, price, and new and improved innovative services offerings.
 Environmental Concerns
  
  As a Professional Service Company, federal, state or local laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment do not materially impact us.
  
  Number of Employees
  
  We have a total of 17 employees.
