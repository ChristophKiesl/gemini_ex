OVERVIEW
 
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company,” which reference, unless the context requires otherwise, also includes our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries), is principally engaged in the operation and development of the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store® concept (“Cracker Barrel”).  We are headquartered in Lebanon, Tennessee and were originally founded in 1969.  We are organized under the laws of the State of Tennessee.
 
We maintain a website at crackerbarrel.com.  We make available free of charge through our website our periodic and other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.  Information on our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC.
 
Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Concept
 
As of September 14, 2017, we operated 645 Cracker Barrel stores in 44 states.  None of our stores are franchised.  Our stores are intended to appeal to both the traveler and the local customer, and we believe they have consistently been a consumer favorite.  We pride ourselves on our consistent quality, value and friendly service.
Store Format: The format of our stores consists of a trademarked rustic old country-store design offering a full-service restaurant menu that features home-style country food and a wide variety of decorative and functional items such as rocking chairs, holiday and seasonal gifts and toys, apparel, cookware and foods.  All stores are freestanding buildings.  Store interiors are subdivided into a dining room occupying approximately 26% of the total interior store space, a gift shop occupying approximately 22% of such space and the balance primarily consisting of kitchen, storage and training areas.  Our stores have stone fireplaces and are decorated with antique‑style furnishings and other authentic and nostalgic items, reminiscent of and similar to those found and sold in the past in traditional old country stores.  The front porch of each store features rows of the signature Cracker Barrel rocking chairs that can be used by guests while waiting for a table in our dining room or after enjoying a meal and are sold by the gift shop.  The kitchens contain modern food preparation and storage equipment allowing for flexibility in menu variety and development.
Products:  Our restaurants, which generated approximately 80% of our total revenue in 2017, offer home-style country cooking featuring many of our own recipes that emphasize authenticity and quality.  Our restaurants serve breakfast, lunch and dinner daily.  Menu items are moderately priced.  The restaurants do not serve alcoholic beverages.
 
Breakfast items can be ordered at any time throughout the day and include juices, eggs, pancakes, fruit and yogurt parfaits, bacon, country ham, sausage, grits, and a variety of biscuit specialties, such as gravy and biscuits and country ham and biscuits.  Lunch and dinner items include country ham, chicken and dumplings, chicken fried chicken, meatloaf, country fried steak, pork chops, fish, steak, roast beef, vegetable plates, a variety of salads, sandwiches, soups, fresh side items and specialty items such as pinto beans and turnip greens.  We also offer lower calorie breakfast, lunch and dinner items, which are full of flavor but with fewer calories.  Additionally, we may from time to time feature new items as off-menu specials or in test menus at certain locations to evaluate possible ways to enhance customer interest and identify potential future additions to the menu.  We offer weekday lunch specials, which include some of our favorite entrées in lunch-sized portions.  Our menu also features weekday and weekend dinner specials that showcase a popular dinner entrée.  There is some variation in menu pricing and content in different regions of the country for both breakfast and lunch/dinner. The average check per guest during 2017 was $10.19, which represents a 1.6% increase over the prior year.  We served an average of approximately 7,000 restaurant guests per week in a typical store in 2017.
 
The following table highlights the price ranges for our meals in 2017:
 
 
 | Price Range | 
-----------------+-------------+---------------
Breakfast | $ | 3.39 to $11.99
Lunch and Dinner | $ | 4.49 to $16.69

The following table highlights each day-part’s percentage of restaurant sales in 2017:
 
 
 | Percentage of Restaurant Sales in 2017 | 
-----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+---
Breakfast Day-Part (until 11:00 a.m.) | | 24 | %
Lunch Day-Part (11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.) | | 39 | %
Dinner Day-Part (4:00 p.m. to close) | | 37 | %



We also offer items for sale in our gift shops that are featured on, or related to, the restaurant menu, such as pies, cornbread mix, coffee, syrups and pancake mixes. Our gift shops, which generated approximately 20% of our total revenue in 2017, offer a wide variety of decorative and functional items such as rocking chairs, seasonal gifts, apparel, toys, music CDs, cookware and various other gift items, as well as various candies, preserves and other food items.
 
The following table highlights the five categories which accounted for the largest shares of our retail sales in 2017:
 
 
 | Percentage of Retail Sales in 2017 | 
------------------------+------------------------------------+---
Apparel and Accessories | | 30 | %
Food | | 18 | %
Décor | | 13 | %
Toys | | 11 | %
Bed and Bath | | 8 | %



Our typical gift shop features approximately 4,800 stock keeping units.  A selection of the food items are sold under the “Cracker Barrel Old Country Store” brand name.  We believe that we achieve high retail sales per square foot of retail selling space (approximately $427 per square foot in 2017) as compared to mall stores both by offering appealing merchandise and by having a significant source of customers who are typically our restaurant guests.
 
We also sell certain licensed food products under the “CB Old Country Store” brand name in the grocery store and retail channels.  These licensed food products currently include ham, bacon, deli meat, jerky, summer sausage, baking mix and gravy mix.
 
Product Development and Merchandising:  We maintain a product development department, which develops new and improved menu items either in response to shifts in customer preferences or to create customer interest.  We use a formal development and testing process, which includes guest research and in-store market tests to ensure products brought to market have a greater likelihood of meeting our goals.  Menu-driven growth is built through three areas:  enhancements to our current core menu offerings, the addition of new core menu offerings and limited time offer promotions we call seasonal events.  Our merchandising department selects and develops products for our gift shop.  We are focused on driving retail sales by converting those customers who come to us for a restaurant visit.  Our assortment includes core and seasonal themes.  Our seasonal themes are designed to create interest and excitement in our stores by providing our guests with additional choices.   Our licensees develop new licensed food products under our direction for consideration and approval.
Store Management and Quality Controls: At each store, our store management typically consists of one general manager, four associate managers and one retail manager.  Our store management is responsible for an average of 104 employees operating two shifts.  The relative complexity of operating one of our stores requires an effective management team at the individual store level.  To motivate store managers to improve sales and operational performance, we maintain bonus plans designed to provide store managers with an opportunity to share in the profits of their store.  The bonus plans also reward managers who achieve specific operational targets.  Each store is assigned to both a restaurant and a retail district manager which each report to a regional vice president.

To ensure that individual stores are operated at a high level of quality, we focus significant attention on the selection and training of store managers.  The store management recruiting and training program begins with an evaluation and screening process.  In addition to multiple interviews and verification of background and experience, we conduct assessments designed to identify those applicants most likely to be best suited to manage store operations. Candidates who successfully pass this screening process are then required to complete a training program.  The restaurant manager training program consists of three weeks of training at our home office and five weeks of in-store training.  The retail manager training program consists of two weeks of training at our home office and three weeks of in-store training.  We believe that our training programs develop managers who can effectively deliver a great employee and guest experience through the leadership and execution of our operating systems.  These programs allow new managers the opportunity to become familiar with our operations, culture, management objectives, controls and evaluation criteria before assuming management responsibility.  We provide our managers and hourly employees with ongoing training through various development courses taught through a blended learning approach, including a mix of hands-on, traditional classroom, written and cloud-based training.  Each store is equipped with dedicated training computers and cloud-based proprietary eLearning instruction programs.  Additionally, each store typically has an employee training coordinator who oversees the training of the store’s hourly employees.
 
Purchasing and Distribution: We negotiate directly with food vendors as to specification, price and other material terms of most food purchases.  We have a contract with an unaffiliated distributor with custom distribution centers in Lebanon, Tennessee; McKinney, Texas; Gainesville, Florida; Elkton, Maryland; Kendallville, Indiana; and Ft. Mill, South Carolina.  We purchase the majority of our food products and restaurant supplies on a cost‑plus basis through this unaffiliated distributor.  The distributor is responsible for placing food orders, warehousing and delivering food products to our stores.  Deliveries are generally made once per week to individual stores.  Produce is purchased through a national program and is delivered three times a week through a network of approximately fifty independent produce suppliers.  Fluid dairy is delivered three times a week through approximately fifty regional dairies, the majority of which are under the ownership of two separate companies.
 
The following table highlights the five food categories which accounted for the largest shares of our food purchasing expense in 2017:
 
 
 | Percentage of Food Purchases in 2017 | 
-----------------------+--------------------------------------+---
Beef | | 14 | %
Dairy (including eggs) | | 12 | %
Fruits and vegetables | | 12 | %
Poultry | | 11 | %
Pork | | 10 | %



Each of these categories includes several individual items.  The single food item within these categories that accounted for the largest share of our food purchasing expense in 2017 was chicken tenders at approximately 5% of total food purchases.  Dairy, fruits and vegetables are purchased through numerous vendors, including local vendors.  Eggs are purchased through three vendors.  We purchase our pork through five vendors, poultry through eight vendors and beef through nine vendors.  Should any food items from a particular vendor become unavailable, we generally believe that these food items could be obtained, or alternative products substituted, in sufficient quantities from other sources at competitive prices to allow us to avoid any material adverse effects that could be caused by such unavailability.
 
We purchase the majority of our retail items (approximately 80% in 2017) directly from domestic and international vendors and warehouse, or crossdock, such items at our retail distribution center in Lebanon, Tennessee, which we lease.  The distribution center fulfills retail item orders generated by our automated replenishment system and generally ships the retail orders once a week to the individual stores by a third-party dedicated freight line.  Certain retail items, not centrally purchased and warehoused at the distribution center, are drop-shipped directly by our vendors to individual stores.
 
Approximately one-third of our 2017 retail items were purchased directly from vendors in the People’s Republic of China.  We have relationships with several foreign buying agencies to source product, monitor quality control and supplement product development.

Operational and Inventory Controls: Our information technology and telecommunications systems and various analytical tools are used to evaluate store operating information and provide management with reports to support prompt detection of unusual variances in food costs, labor costs or operating expenses.  Management also monitors individual store restaurant and retail sales on a daily basis and closely monitors sales mix, sales trends, operational costs and inventory levels. The information generated by the information technology and telecommunication systems, analysis tools and monitoring processes is used to manage the operations of each store, replenish retail inventory levels and facilitate retail purchasing decisions.  These systems and processes also are used in the development of forecasts, budget analyses and planning.
Guest Satisfaction:  We are committed to providing our guests a home-style, country-cooked meal, and a variety of retail merchandise served and sold with genuine hospitality in a comfortable environment.  Our commitment to offering guests a quality experience begins with our employees.  Our mission statement, “Pleasing People,” embraces guests and employees alike, and our employees are trained on the importance of that mission in a culture of mutual respect.  We also are committed to staffing each store with an experienced management team to ensure attentive guest service and consistent food quality.  Through the regular use of guest surveys and store visits by district managers and operational vice presidents, management receives valuable feedback that is used in our ongoing efforts to improve the stores and to demonstrate our continuing commitment to pleasing our guests.  We have a guest-relations call center that takes comments and suggestions from guests and forwards them to operations or other management for information and follow up.  We use Internet and interactive voice response systems to monitor operational performance and guest satisfaction at all stores on an ongoing basis.  We have public notices in our menus, on our website and posted in our stores informing customers and employees about how to contact us by Internet or toll-free telephone number with questions, complaints or concerns regarding services or products.  We conduct training on how to gather information and investigate and resolve customer concerns.  This is accompanied by comprehensive training for all store employees on our public accommodations policy and commitment to “Pleasing People.”
 
Marketing: We employ multiple media to reach and engage our guests.  Outdoor advertising (i.e., billboards and state department of transportation signs) is the largest advertising vehicle we use to reach our traveling and local guests. In 2017, we had over 1,600 billboards and this expenditure accounts for approximately one-third of total advertising spend annually.   We believe we are among the top billboard advertisers in the restaurant industry.  Our use of non-billboard media has increased in recent years as we look to build market awareness for local occasions.  This increased support has used broadcast television, national cable and digital support.  In 2017, we ran media in each quarter.  We continued to increase our efforts in the digital space to drive preference and engagement with the brand.  We now have properties on multiple social media sites, an e-commerce platform and our brand site.  Our exclusive music program drives awareness for the brand and builds cultural relevance and affinity with our guests.  We plan to continue to have multiple releases each year with specific promotional support for each release.  In 2017, we spent approximately 2.9% of our revenues on advertising.
 
Store Development:  We opened six new stores in 2017. We plan to open eight to nine new stores during 2018.  As of September 14, 2017, approximately 83% of our stores are located along interstate highways.  Our remaining stores are located off-interstate or near tourist destinations.  We believe we should pursue development of both interstate locations and off-interstate locations to capitalize on the strength of our brand associated with travelers on the interstate highway system and by locating in certain local markets where our guests live and work, including locations outside of our existing core markets and in states where we currently do not operate.
 
Of the 645 stores open as of September 14, 2017, we own the land and buildings for 418, while the other 227 properties are either ground leases or ground and building leases.  Land costs for stores opened during 2017 averaged $596 per site if owned. Building, site improvement, furniture, equipment and related development costs for stores opened during 2017 averaged $3,942.  Pre-opening costs averaged $544 per store in 2017.
 
Our current store prototype is approximately 9,000 square feet, including approximately 2,100 square feet of retail selling space, and has dining room seating for approximately 180 guests.  Our capital investment in new stores may differ in the future due to changes in our store prototype, building design specifications, site location and site characteristics.

Holler & Dash Concept
 
In 2016, the Company launched its new fast casual concept, Holler & Dash Biscuit HouseTM. The concept offers biscuit-inspired entrées and a unique portfolio of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage options. We opened two new locations in 2017.  We plan to open three to four new locations in 2018.  At September 14, 2017, five Holler & Dash locations were open - all leased properties in Alabama, Florida, Tennessee and Georgia. The new concept is a smaller footprint and has operating hours limited to the breakfast and lunch day parts.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of July 28, 2017, we employed approximately 73,000 people, of whom 529 were in advisory and supervisory capacities, 3,547 were in-store management positions and 38 were officers.  Many store personnel are employed on a part‑time basis.  None of our employees is represented by any union, and management considers its employee relations to be good.
COMPETITION
 
The restaurant and retail industries are intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, retail merchandise, price, service, location, personnel, concept, attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing.  We compete with a significant number of national and regional restaurant and retail chains, some of which have greater resources than us, as well as locally owned restaurants and retail stores.  We also face growing competition from the supermarket industry, which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section; fast casual restaurants; quick-service restaurants; and highly promotional casual and family dining restaurants.  We expect competition to continue in all of these areas, which could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives. The restaurant and retail businesses are also often affected by changes in consumer taste and preference; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic and weather patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants and retailers; and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power.  In addition, factors such as inflation, increased food, labor and benefits costs and the lack of experienced management and hourly employees may adversely affect the restaurant and retail industries in general and our stores in particular.  We believe we compete effectively and have successfully differentiated ourselves from many of our competitors in the restaurant and retail industries through a unique brand and guest experience, which offers a diversified full service menu and a large variety of nostalgic and unique retail items.  For further information regarding competition, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
RAW MATERIALS SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY
 
Essential restaurant supplies and raw materials are generally available from several sources.  Generally, we are not dependent upon single sources of supplies or raw materials.  However, in our stores, certain branded items are single source products or product lines.  Our ability to maintain consistent quality throughout our store system depends in part upon our ability to acquire food products and related items from reliable sources.  When the supply of certain products is uncertain or prices are expected to rise significantly, we may enter into purchase contracts or purchase bulk quantities for future use.
 
Adequate alternative sources of supply, as well as the ability to adjust menus if needed, are believed to exist for substantially all of our restaurant products.  Our retail supply chain generally involves longer lead-times and, often, more remote sources of product, including the People’s Republic of China, and most of our retail product is distributed to our stores through a single distribution center.  Although disruption of our retail supply chain could be difficult to overcome, we continuously evaluate the potential for disruptions and ways to mitigate such disruptions should they occur.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
 
Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations have not historically had a significant impact on our operations; however, we cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental legislation or regulations on our operations.

TRADEMARKS
 
We deem the various Cracker Barrel trademarks and service marks that we own to be of substantial value.  Our policy is to obtain federal registration of trademarks and other intellectual property whenever possible and to pursue vigorously any infringement of our trademarks and service marks.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
 
While research and development is important to us, these expenditures have not been material due to the nature of the restaurant and retail industries.
 
SEASONAL ASPECTS
 
Historically, our revenue and profits have been lower in the first and third fiscal quarters and higher in the second and fourth fiscal quarters.  We attribute these variations primarily to the holiday shopping season and the summer vacation and travel season.  Our gift shop sales, which are made substantially to our restaurant guests, historically have been highest in our second quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season.  Historically, interstate tourist traffic and the propensity to dine out have been much higher during the summer months, thereby generally contributing to higher profits in the Company’s fourth quarter.  We also generally open additional new stores throughout the year.  Therefore, the results of operations for any interim period cannot be considered indicative of the operating results for an entire year.
WORKING CAPITAL
 
In the restaurant industry, substantially all sales are either for cash or third-party credit card.  Therefore, like many restaurant companies, we are able to, and often do operate with negative working capital.  Restaurant inventories purchased through our principal food distributor are on terms of net zero days, while other restaurant inventories purchased locally generally are financed through trade credit at terms of 30 days or less.  Because of our gift shop, which has a lower product turnover than the restaurant, we carry larger inventories than many other companies in the restaurant industry.  Retail inventories are generally financed through trade credit at terms of 60 days or less.  These various trade terms are aided by rapid product turnover of the restaurant inventory.  Employees generally are paid on weekly or semi-monthly schedules in arrears of hours worked except for bonuses that are paid either quarterly or annually in arrears.  Many other operating expenses have normal trade terms and certain expenses, such as certain taxes and some benefits, are deferred for longer periods of time.
