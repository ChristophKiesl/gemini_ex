Further description of the business segment within which we operate is provided below.
Specialty Foods Segment
The following table presents the primary food products we manufacture and sell under our brand names:

Vegetable dips and fruit dips | Marzetti

We also manufacture and sell other products pursuant to brand license agreements including Olive Garden® dressings and Jack Daniel’s® mustards, as well as endorsement agreements including Hungry Girl® flatbreads and Weight Watchers® flatbreads. A portion of our sales are products sold under private label to retailers, distributors and restaurants primarily in the United States. Additionally, a small portion of our sales are dressing packets, frozen specialty noodles, pasta and flatbreads sold to industrial customers for use as ingredients or components in their products.
Sales are made to retail and foodservice channels. The vast majority of the products we sell in the retail and foodservice channels are sold through sales personnel, food brokers and distributors. We have strong placement of products in U.S. grocery produce departments through our refrigerated salad dressings, vegetable and fruit dips, and croutons. Our flatbread products and sprouted grain bakery products are generally placed in the specialty bakery/deli section of the grocery store. We also have products typically marketed in grocery aisles, which include shelf-stable salad dressing, slaw dressing, dry egg noodles and croutons. Within the frozen aisles of grocery retailers, we also have prominent market positions of frozen yeast rolls, garlic breads and egg noodles. Products we sell in the foodservice channel are often custom-formulated and include salad dressings, sandwich and dipping sauces, frozen breads and yeast rolls.

Net sales attributable to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (“Wal-Mart”) totaled 17%, 16% and 16% of consolidated net sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net sales attributable to McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”), a wholesale distribution subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., totaled 16%, 19% and 18% of consolidated net sales for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. McLane is a large, national distributor that sells and distributes our products to several of our foodservice national chain customers, principally in the quick service and casual dining channels. In general, our foodservice national chain customers have direct relationships with us, but many choose to buy our products through McLane, who acts as their distributor. McLane orders our products on behalf of these customers, and we invoice McLane for these sales. The decline in net sales to McLane in 2017 was primarily attributed to the choice of certain foodservice national chain customers to switch to a different distributor and the impact of our targeted business rationalization efforts in the foodservice channel that began in mid-2016. Other than Wal-Mart and McLane, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales during these years.
We continue to rely upon our strong retail brands, innovation expertise, geographic and channel expansion and customer relationships for future growth. Our category-leading retail brands and commitment to new product development help drive increased consumer demand in our retail channel. In the foodservice channel, we grow our business with established customers and pursue new opportunities by leveraging our culinary skills and experience to support the development of new products and menu offerings. Strategic acquisitions are also part of our future growth plans, with a focus on fit and value.
The majority of our products are manufactured at our 16 food plants located throughout the United States. Certain items are also manufactured and packaged by third parties located in the United States, Canada and Europe.
Efficient and cost-effective production remains a key focus as evidenced by our recent lean six sigma initiative. In 2015 we completed a significant processing capacity expansion at our Horse Cave, Kentucky dressing facility to help improve throughput and meet demand for our dressing products.
Our sales are affected by seasonal fluctuations, primarily in the fiscal second quarter and the Easter holiday season when sales of certain frozen retail products tend to be most pronounced. The impacts on working capital are not significant. We do not utilize any franchises or concessions. In addition to the owned and licensed trademarked brands discussed above, we also own and operate under innumerable other intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, formulas, proprietary trade secrets, technologies, know-how processes and other unregistered rights. We consider our owned and licensed intellectual property rights to be essential to our business.
NET SALES BY CLASS OF PRODUCTS
The following table sets forth information with respect to the percentage of net sales contributed by each class of similar products that account for at least 10% of our consolidated net sales in any year from 2015 through 2017:

 | 2017 | 2016 | 2015
Specialty Foods | | | 
Non-frozen | 68% | 69% | 67% 
Frozen | 32% | 31% | 33% 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The estimated amount spent during each of the last three years on research and development activities determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles was less than 1% of net sales.
BACKLOG
Orders are generally filled in three to seven days. We do not view the amount of backlog at any particular point in time as a meaningful indicator of longer-term shipments.
COMPETITION
All of the markets in which we sell food products are highly competitive in the areas of price, quality and customer service. We face competition from a number of manufacturers of various sizes and capabilities. Our ability to compete depends upon a variety of factors, including the position of our branded goods within various categories, product quality, product innovation, promotional and marketing activity, pricing and our ability to service customers.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental protection laws. Based upon available information, compliance with these laws and regulations did not have a material effect upon the level of capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position in 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact in 2018.
EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS
As of June 30, 2017 we had 2,800 employees, 19% of which are represented under various collective bargaining contracts. There are no employees represented under collective bargaining contracts that will expire within one year. While we believe that labor relations with all our employees are satisfactory, a prolonged labor dispute or an organizing attempt could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES
Over 95% of our products are sold in the United States. Foreign operations and export sales have not been significant in the past and are not expected to be significant in the future based upon existing operations. We do not have any fixed assets located outside of the United States.
RAW MATERIALS
During 2017, we obtained adequate supplies of raw materials and packaging. We rely on a variety of raw materials and packaging for the day-to-day production of our products, including soybean oil, various sweeteners, eggs, dairy-related products, flour, various films and plastic and paper packaging materials.
We purchase the majority of these materials on the open market to meet current requirements, but we also have some fixed-price contracts with terms generally one year or less. See further discussion in our “Risk Factors” section below and our contractual obligations disclosure in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”). Although the availability and price of certain of these materials are influenced by weather, disease and the level of global demand, we anticipate that future sources of supply will generally be available and adequate for our needs.
