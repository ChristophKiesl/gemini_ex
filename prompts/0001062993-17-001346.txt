ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 It is the Companys belief that the United States, along with most parts of the world are in the very early stages of a significant spike in the growth curve for less-lethal products. Most law enforcement agencies do not have a proper working knowledge of a less-lethal program in place. Rather they are using an assortment of less-lethal devices out of necessity for varying degrees of effectiveness with little coordination or approved tactical plans for their deployment. Law enforcement budget constraints usually play a role in this behavior. It is for this reason that unintended deaths of unarmed suspects at the hands of police departments throughout the country (and in fact throughout the world) continue to happen. 
 With a rise in social and civil unrest both here and abroad and with more and more of these incidents being caught on video and posted on social media, the pressure on law enforcement and governments to find reasonable and effective alternatives to lethal force is mounting daily. As a result, it is managements opinion that the less-lethal market will be one of the faster growing segment in the law enforcement, correctional services, crowd control and security services markets over the next decade. 
 Less-lethal weapons include a wide variety of products designed to disorient, slow down and stop would be assailants, rioters and other malfeasants. In the Companys opinion, the less-lethal weapon that is growing the fastest in popularity and adoption is the 40mm launcher along with the various less-lethal munitions that can be fired from these launchers. These munitions include both impact rounds designed to stop an individual without causing permanent injury to payload rounds carrying a variety of powders and liquids including tear gas, pepper spray, DNA marking liquids, mal-odorants and other marking liquids and powders designed to identify instigators in a riot situation. 
 Historically, these munitions were fired from 37mm launchers, however, the industry has been moving to 40mm launchers due to the fact that the 40mm launcher barrel is rifled (while the 37mm is a smooth bore barrel less accurate munition) which allows the operator to more accurately fire the rounds at distances in excess of 100. This makes the 40mm launcher an effective tool in a wide range of situations.

Business
 History 
 Security Devices International Inc. (the Company or the Corporation) was incorporated on March 1, 2005. The Company began as a research and development company focused on the development of 40mm less-lethal ammunition. 
 The Company initiated with the development of a wireless electric projectile (the WEP), named the Lektrox. The Company hired a ballistics engineering firm to collaborate in the development of the WEP. 
 Commencing in December 2008, the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) of the US Department of Defense, an organization responsible for the development and coordination of non-lethal weapons activities within the United States, tested the WEP through its evaluation facility at Penn State University. An executive summary was released to the Company indicating a positive outcome.
 In the fall of 2010 the Company underwent a change in the board of directors and management. This precipitated a change in the direction of the company as development of the WEP was discontinued and the company shifted its focus to a new product  the Blunt Impact Projectile (BIP). The Company concluded that the cost and time required to complete development and testing of the BIP were significantly less than that required to complete development and testing of the WEP. The goal was to develop a product that it could bring to market more quickly. The Company was able to exploit some of the patent pending technology of the WEP into the BIP. In 2011, the Company moved its engineering, intellectual property and production facilities to the operator (the BIP Manufacturer) of an injection molding facility outside of Boston, Massachusetts. 
 The Blunt Impact Projectile (BIP)  A Transformative Technology 
 When the less-lethal industry was dominated by the 37mm launcher, a number of less-lethal companies developed impact munition rounds designed to stop an assailant. These round were nothing more than a piece of plastic, wood baton, rubber baton, or a piece of plastic with a piece of sponge rubber or foam rubber affixed to the head of the round.
 There were several problems with these rounds. First, they were inaccurate due to the lack of barrel rifling. Since most SWAT teams carry single shot launchers, a round that cannot be shot accurately is of little value. Second, because of their lightweight, they did not have much stopping power. Suspects that were committed would often shake off a direct hit. Finally, the rounds would bounce off walls or other hard surfaces which made them dangerous to use in confined areas such as a jail cell. Numerous corrections officers have been hurt by impact rounds ricocheting off of jail cell walls.
 Security Devices International solved all three issues with the development of its Blunt Impact Projectile (BIP). The BIP was developed as an outgrowth of a research and development project to create a conductive electric device bullet (project name WEP  Wireless Electric Projectile). 
 In order to ensure that the projectile did not injure the targeted individual, SDI needed to develop a way to cushion the impact of the round upon contact with the target. The solution was a collapsible head that compressed upon impact. (See below). When it became clear that SDI did not have sufficient funds to complete development of the WEP, it was decided to use the collapsible head design to create an impact round. The hope was that with this new, state-of-the-art impact round, SDI could generate enough profitability that it would be able to complete development of the WEP.

This collapsible head technology allowed SDI to build a heavier projectile that did not require a rubber or foam tip. This meant that it could take advantage of the rifling of the 40mm launcher. This made the BIP by far the most accurate round on the market in comparison to previous 37mm projectiles. The target for an impact round is to be a large muscle group such as the thigh muscle. 
 The gel collapsible head of the BIP spreads out upon impact, dispersing the energy over a larger area thus reducing blunt trauma to the subject. This allows the BIP round to be fired at close range on a target. 
 The Company believes that its patented collapsible head technology will transform the industry as law enforcement agencies recognize the tactical advantages of a less-lethal weapon that can be safely, accurately and effectively deployed at close range distances between 3 feet and 100 feet. There is simply nothing else on the market today that can compete with the BIP. SDI has been in discussions several industry players about licensing SDIs technology. 
 Early in 2011 the Company focused its attention on a new 40mm product, the blunt impact projectile (BIP), and discontinued further development work on the WEP. 
 2012
 In June 2012, the Company contracted CRT Less Lethal Inc. (CRT) to test the BIP. Based on data obtained from the three-stage evaluation, the BIP passed the CRT testing protocol for accuracy, consistency, relative safety and effectiveness.
 In July 2012, the Company signed a five-year development, supply and manufacturing agreement with a subcontractor to Manufacture the BIP. 
 In November 2012, the Company obtained a United States Department of Transportation number (DOT#) required in order for the Company to ship BIP rounds.

In 2012, the Company began the development of five new less-lethal ammunition rounds. These new rounds will be a modified version of the BIP, four of which carry a payload, including; BIP MP (temporary powder-based marking agent), BIP ML (semi-permanent liquid marking agent), BIP OC (Oleoresin Capsicum - a pepper spray powder), BIP MO (malodorant liquid), and the BIP TR (training round). 
 2013
 The Company moved its full manufacturing and supply chain operations to the BIP manufacturer, a supply manufacturing and engineering company, in the Boston, MA area. 
 The Company undertook an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in January and became a public reporting issuer on the TSX-Venture Exchange in September 2013. 
 2014
 SDI began another globally recognized testing protocol with a military agency called HECOE (the Human Effects Centre of Excellence). This world-renowned agency is located in the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), in partnership with the US Joint Non-lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD). This group conducts research to assist Non-lethal Weapon (NLW) Program Managers across the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in assessing effectiveness and risks of NLWs. The positive conclusion of this testing allows DOD to purchase SDI rounds.
 April - SDI appointed Keith Morrison to the board of directors as non-executive Chairman
 May - SDIs BIP rounds were used at the Mock Prison Riot in West Virginia. Law enforcement and correctional services officers provided feedback on new technologies (such as SDIs products) to assist in the effectiveness of their jobs. 
 August - The Company completed the issuance of 1,549 convertible unsecured debentures at $1,000 per debenture for gross proceeds of $1,549,000 (the Private Placement).

He has also developed training programs for the US Military (Reserve, National Guard, and Coast Guard) , Federal Agencies, various local and state agencies, as well as private security.
 During Q4, the Company applied for its Federal Firearms and Federal Explosives Licenses. These licenses will permit the Company to enhance its product line to a much broader less-lethal offering. The licensing will also allow the Company to house and travel with 40mm launchers and munitions for demonstrations globally.
 Operations
 Subsequent to the year the Company secured a new office and distribution warehouse in Perry, Florida. This facility sets the foundation for regional distribution of SDIs future and existing products, and a new presence in Florida, one of the target markets of the Company. 
Website Update
 SDI continues to update its website to manage its digital presence, as well as maintain its top positioning in search engines for the less-lethal industry. The Company has also revised it messaging to respond to recent global law enforcement confrontations, such as incidents in the US, South America and in Europe.
Products
 SDIs business is the development, manufacture and sale of less-lethal ammunition. This ammunition is used by the military, correctional services, and police agencies for crowd control.
 The Company has two products:
 
a) | The Company has developed the BIP, a blunt impact projectile which uses pain compliance to control a target. The Company has developed six versions of the standard BIP, five of which contain a payload and one of which is a cheaper cost, training round. A payload is an internal medium within the BIP, holding a liquid or powder substance. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b) | The Company has undertaken substantial work to develop the WEP, a wireless electric projective which releases an electrical pulse that induces a muscle spasm and causes the target to fall to the ground helpless. 

Intellectual Property 
 Five patent applications, four non-provisional and one provisional, have been filed by the Company with the U.S. Patent Office. The Patents have been granted on the four non-provisional patents. 
 Non-Provisional (granted patents):
 (a) Less-lethal Projectile: This issued patent relates to the Companys distinctive collapsible ammunition head technology that absorbs kinetic energy of the projectile upon impact. The Corporations collapsible head is used in both the BIP and the WEP.
 (b) Electronic Circuitry for Incapacitating a Living Target: This issued patent relates to the electronic circuitry incapacitation system which forms part of the WEP. The patent describes an electronic circuit which provides an electrical incapacitation current to a living target. 
 8

(c) Less-lethal Wireless Stun Projectile System for Immobilizing a Target by Neuro-Muscular Disruption: This issued patent describes the process by which the WEP operates with its attachment system to halt a target through a neuro-muscular-disruption system.
 (d) Autonomous Operation of a Less-lethal Projectile: This patent describes a motion sensing system within the WEP. The sensor will monitor movement of the target and enable the electrical output until the target is subdued. The electrical pulse is programmed for an exact time-frame to specifications of the user.
 Provisional Patent:
 (e) Payload carrying arrangement for a non-lethal projectile: This Provisional patent relates to the process of carrying liquid and powder payloads in the head of the BIP munitions that upon impact release from the head and are dispersed upon the target.
 The Companys policy has been to write off cost incurred in connection with non-provisional and provisional patent costs as they are incurred as a recoverability of such expenditure is uncertain.
