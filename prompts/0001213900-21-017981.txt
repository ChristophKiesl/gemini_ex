ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are principally engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products for human use in connection with a variety of high-incidence and high-mortality diseases and medical conditions prevalent in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”). All of our operations are conducted in the PRC, where our manufacturing facilities are located. We manufacture pharmaceutical products in the form of dry powder injectables, liquid injectables, tablets, capsules, and cephalosporin oral solutions. The majority of our pharmaceutical products are sold on a prescription basis and all have been approved for at least one or more therapeutic indications by the National Medical Products Administration (the “NMPA”, formerly China Food and Drug Administration, CFDA) based upon demonstrated safety and efficacy.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we manufactured 19 pharmaceutical products for a wide variety of diseases and medical indications, each of which may be classified into one of three general categories:
 

● | Basic generic drugs, which are common drugs in the PRC for which there is a very large market demand;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | First-to-market generic drugs, which are generic Western drugs that are new to the PRC marketplace; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Modern Traditional Chinese Medicines, which are generally comprised of non-synthetic, plant-based medicinal compounds of the type that have been widely used in the PRC for thousands of years, to which we apply modern production techniques to produce pharmaceutical products in different formulations, such as tablets, capsules or powders.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In selecting generic drugs to develop and manufacture, we consider several factors, including the number of other manufacturers currently producing a particular drug, the size of the market for that drug, the proposed or required method of distribution, the existing and expected pricing for that particular drug in the marketplace, the costs of manufacturing that drug, and the costs of acquiring or developing the formula for that drug. We believe we have historically selected generic drugs for manufacture that have large addressable markets and higher profit margins relative to other generic drugs manufactured and distributed in the PRC.
 
In addition, we manufactured one comprehensive healthcare product and two protective products.
 
We currently own and operate two production facilities in Haikou, Hainan Province, PRC, one of which has a construction area of 663.94 square meters. The other factory has two buildings with production area of 20,282.42 square meters and 6,593.20 square meters. We implement quality control procedures in this facility in compliance with the PRC’s Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP standards, and applicable NMPA regulations to ensure consistent quality in our products.
 
The NMPA promulgated Good Manufacturing Practices for Pharmaceutical Products (2010 revised version) on February 12, 2011 (effective as of March 1, 2011) (the “Year 2011 GMP”). The Year 2011 GMP standards outline the basic principles and standards for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical products and the management of quality controls in the pharmaceutical products manufacturing industry in the PRC. All of our production lines: tablets, capsules, dry power, liquid injectables, solid oral solution Cephalosporins (specifically designated), are in full compliance with the Year 2011 GMP standard. A newly revised Drug Administration Law (the “New Law”) came into effect on December 1, 2019, which cancelled the GMP certification but impose the pilot inspection mechanism in the event any production line(s) does not satisfy any pilot inspection under the New Law, the production on such production line(s) could be suspended.
 
We market and sell our products through 16 sales offices covering all major cities and provinces in the PRC. To comply with applicable Chinese laws relating to sales of prescription drugs to certain hospitals and clinics, we also use a distribution system comprised of over 1,000 independent prefecture-level, city-level, and county-level distributors. Our sales system has further developed and expanded with the expansion of Chinese healthcare reform, and our 16 provincial offices deliver our products to basic health care institutions as well as tier two and tier three hospitals through the above mentioned distributors.

Our corporate organizational chart is set forth below.
 

Industry Background and Market Opportunities
 
We have observed the following trends in China's healthcare industry in recent years:
 
1. The level of basic medical insurance has been improved in an all-round way. According to The 2019 Communique on Statistics on the Development of HealthCare in China (hereinafter referred to as Communique) published by Chinese National Health Insurance Administration on June 6, 2020, more than 1.35 billion people participated in Basic Medical Insurance System (BMIS) in 2019, and the participation rate remained stable at more than 95%. The reimbursement rate for hospital expenses of Basic Medical Insurance System for Urban Employees (BMISUE) and Urban and Rural Residences Medical Insurance System (URRMIS) has been raised to more than 60%.
 
2. Expenditures on essential medicines have decreased significantly. As per the Communique, the proportion of expenditure on essential medicines in health institutions at all levels. After the abolition of “drug adds-on”, in public hospitals, the share of drug revenue in total income has declined from 46.33% in 2010 to 32.71% in 2018; the average drug costs per outpatient rate as a percentage of total costs has fell from 51.5% in 2009 to 40.6% in 2019; while drug costs as a percentage of total hospitalization expenses fell from 43.6% in 2009 to 27.5% in 2019. In Community Health Centres, the proportion of medicines to hospitalization costs was 35.4% in 2019, down 13.9 % from 2010 levels. In township hospitals, the proportion of hospitalization cost of medicines to total expenditure was 38.5% in 2019, down 14.4% from 2010.
 
3. The capacity of health services in primary-level institutions is growing. In the case of township hospitals, there has been a significant increase in the number of visits and hospitalizations, with the number of beds per 10,000 agricultural population rising from 10.50 in 2009 to 14.80 in 2019. In 2020, the central government spent RMB50.38 billion on basic public health services, and RMB9.95 billion on COVID-19 prevention and control for grass-roots medical institutions.
 
4. The System of Graded Diagnosis and Treatment (SGDT) has been steadily advanced. The primary community health service center and the second and third-level hospitals was open as a medical union in cities, to achieve the sharing of medical and health resources between regions.

The General Office of the State Council of China issued The Key Tasks for Deepening the Reform of the Medical and Health System in the Second Half of 2020 (hereinafter referred to as the Tasks) on July 23, 2020.
 
The Tasks pointed out that since the outbreak of COVID-19, our medical and health system has stood the test and played an important role in winning the battle with this epidemic. In the second half of 2020, the Tasks urged us to promote the deepening of medical reform and the prevention and treatment of the COVID-19 epidemic, put prevention in a more prominent position, and continue to transfer from a treatment-centred approach to a population health-centred approach. We continue to reform medical care, medical insurance and medicine, and focus on solving the problem of "inadequate and overly expensive medical services".
 
With the growth of China’s per capita income, people’s awareness of health care has been gradually increasing. Medical consumption expenditure and consumer demand for higher-level health care are expected to continue to grow. In early March 2021, China's vice minister of Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security said at a press conference that people aged 60 and over had reached 18.1% of the overall population by the end of 2019, and that the country's elderly population is expected to exceed 300 million in the coming five years. According to the China Development Research Foundation's China Development Report 2020, Chinese aging populations will peak during 2035 to 2050, and that by 2050, China's elderly population aged 60 and over will be close to 500 million, accounting for more than a third of the total population. In view of the increased awareness of health care and the ageing society, the increasing industry concentration and internationalization, and the fact that NMPA initiated policies to encourage mergers and reorganizations among business entities to seek joint development, we are optimistic about the development of China’s pharmaceutical industry.
 
Impact from the New Coronavirus Global Pandemic (“COVID-19”) 
 
Since the end of 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has spread around the world: from January to February 2020 in China, to February to April 2020 in the United States, Italy, Spain and other European and American countries, to April to August in the United States, India, Brazil, Russia, till the second outbreak in Europe and other regions in August, overseas outbreaks continue to ferment. In December 2020, situation in the United Kingdom continues to deteriorate.
 
The outbreak of COVID-19 has a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business operations. These included, but are not limited to, disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel or to distribute our products, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers in early 2020. The Company reopened its facility and ramped up its operations in the first quarter 2020. In addition, COVID-19 not only brought a widespread health crisis, it also adversely affected the economies and financial markets in China and many other countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could significantly impact the Company operating results.
 
The Chinese government has responded positively to the COVID-19 outbreak by introducing a series of policies in a timely manner, including:
 
The General Office of the National Health and Wellness Commission of China issued the “Notice on Further Improving the Emergency Response Capacity of Pre-Hospital Medical Care under the Normalization of the Prevention and Control of the COVID-19” on July 15, 2020.
 
China's National Health and Wellness Commission officially announced the “COVID-19 Prevention and Control Program (7th Edition)” on September 16, 2020.
 
Since the release of COVID-19 vaccine in December 2020, the world is making every effort to accelerate the vaccination progress. However, although the vaccine has played a positive role in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the number of new daily incurred cases of COVID-19 has dropped for six weeks in the world, WHO officials say the apparent turning point of the global outbreak has not arrived, and the task to prevent and control the epidemic remains daunting. Michael Ryan, WHO's head of the health emergency program, spoke on a news conference on March 1, 2021 local time that it was impossible to end the outbreak this year. At present, the focus is to control the spread of the new coronavirus and to avoid the virus mutation, and to improve the speed of vaccination at the same time.

Consistency Evaluation for Generic Drugs
 
The “consistency evaluation of generic drugs” refers to the evaluation of generic drugs that were approved for market, for the consistency with the quality and efficacy of the original drug. The goal is for generic drugs to achieve the same level of quality and efficacy as the original drugs and to replace the original drugs in clinical use. This can not only save medical expenses, but also improve the development of the pharmaceutical industry, and to ensure the safety and effectiveness of public drug use.
 
The State Council issued the Pilot Program for the Central Procurement and Use of Drugs by State Organizations (the “Program”) on January 17, 2019. The Program calls for the selection of pilot drugs from generics that have passed the "consistency evaluation", and for centralized procurement and use in order to reduce drug prices and reduce patient drug costs. According to documents of the third batch of national centralized procurement issued in July 2020, generic products are required to pass the NMPA’s generic drug consistency evaluation to be eligible for procurement.
 
NMPA issued an official document on The Implementation of the Evaluation of the Quality and Efficacy of Chemical Injection Generics on May 14, 2020, requiring consistency evaluation for generics of pharmaceutical injections that are already on the market. According to the CPM New Drug Research and Development Monitoring Database, a total of 183 chemical injections passed the consistency evaluation in 2020.
 
Our company has actively promoted the consistency evaluation process of several key current existing oral products in 2020. We have a product that passed biological equivalents experiments of consistency evaluation in March 2021. We plan to submit its relevant documentation and data to NMPA in the near future.
 
The PRC’s medical insurance system
 
The New Rural Cooperative Medical System (NRCMS) was officially launched in rural areas in 2003. It is a critical illnesses-oriented medical assistance system for farmers, and has achieved full coverage in 2008. In towns and cities, The Urban Residences Medical Insurance System (“URMIS”) has been in operation since 2007. It provides medical security for urban residents through financing organized by the government, with residents' contributions as the main source of funds and supplemented by appropriate government subsidies. In order to further expand the coverage of medical insurance and coordinate the economic and social development of urban and rural areas, in January 2016, the State Council issued the Opinions on the Integration of the Basic Medical Insurance System for Urban and Rural Residents (the Opinion). The Opinion proposes to integrate the NRCMS and URMIS, to establish a unified basic medical insurance system for urban and rural residents, and further unify the operation of services and information systems to improve the quality and efficiency of operation.
 
According to the Communique, 329 million people participated in health insurance for workers and 1,024 million people participated in medical insurance for urban and rural residents. The total income of the basic medical insurance fund was RMB2442.1 billion, an increase of 10.2% over the previous year, accounting for about 2.5% of GDP in the current year, The total expenditure was RMB2085.4 billion, an increase of 12.2% over the previous year, and the cumulative balance was RMB276.97 billion. Experts pointed out that in 2019, the URRMIS has been fully integrated, the scale of the medical insurance fund has been expanded, and the anti-risk capacity of the medical insurance fund has been improved.
 
Our Strategy
 
We believe that the pursuit of innovation is imperative for providing the basic medical solutions needed by the majority of patients. We are passionate about protecting human health, and we always adhere to the highest standards of ethics and integrity to fulfill our firm commitment to our customers and patients.
 
We believe we are well-positioned in a comparatively steadily growing industry in one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. China's per capita GDP exceeds US$10,000 in 2019, which stimulates consumption structure upgrade, and the establishment of a high-quality health care system. We currently manufacture a number of off-patent branded generic drugs. Our diverse portfolio of products and new product pipelines include products for high-incidence and high-mortality conditions in the PRC, such as cardiovascular, central nervous system (“CNS”), infectious, and digestive diseases. We launched wash-free sanitizers and various types of masks since the outbreak of COVID-19 at year end 2019. In addition, we continue to explore comprehensive healthcare market after the launch of Noni enzymes in 2018.

Consistency evaluation of our current existing major products will be the focus of our strategy in the near future. The consistency evaluation of generic drugs will improve Chinese generic drugs quality and eliminate unqualified enterprises, so that high-quality generic drug companies are expected to benefit from it. Consistency evaluation, together with the GPO, is optimizing the competitive landscape of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry. We believe that the market space and growth potential of Chinese generic drugs are huge.
 
A series of medical reform policies introduced in recent years has profound and far-reaching impact on pharmaceutical companies. Therefore, early consideration of the transformation and upgrading, as well as product positioning become very important. Based on our experience in R&D, production and marketing experiences, and our market insights, we have decided to gradually adjust our strategy to produce generic and innovative drugs with high value in pharma-economics, good clinical efficacy and market differentiation. These include drugs that treat chronic diseases prevalent in China, geriatric diseases, cancers, and nutritional products.
 
In addition, as another direction of strategic development, we will actively explore connectivity on the Internet. We will take the initiative to learn, participate, and put our products to the online market, to achieve online and offline connectivity of a complete ecological system.  
 
Our objective is to leverage our expertise in the PRC for the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. We intend to achieve this objective by:
 
Promoting Our Existing Brands to Increase Our National Recognition. We intend to support and grow the existing recognition and reputation of our brands and to maintain our branded pricing strategy through continued sales and marketing efforts through our new, upgraded GMP-compliant production lines. To achieve this goal, we plan to promote the efficacy and safety profile of our established prescription pharmaceutical products to physicians at hospitals and clinics in all provinces of PRC through the efforts of our sales force, independent distributors and educational physician conferences and seminars.
 
Promoting the progress of consistency evaluation of our current existing main products. We intend to cope with the latest policies and the GPO requirements. We aim to make efficient use of our existing human and material resources, and strive to create favorable conditions for product sales and international development through gaining a favorable result in the consistency evaluation.
 
Exploring the market for comprehensive health products. To advocate a healthy way of life, we intend to explore the market for comprehensive health products and help our customers not only ‘cure the disease’, but also ‘prevent potential diseases’, eliminate sub-health, improve physical fitness, reduce pain, and maintain good health management.
 
Expanding Our Distribution Network to Increase Market Penetration. We intend to expand our reach beyond our current 16 offices in the PRC to drive additional growth of our existing and future products. We currently contract with over 1,000 distributors in the PRC and plan to expand on these relationships to target new markets. We will continue our conservative sales strategy of increased cooperation with customers with reliable accounts receivable collection performance. In addition, we plan to continue to broaden our marketing efforts outside of major cities in the PRC and to increase our market penetration in cities and rural areas where we already have a presence. Over the long term, we also intend to expand our presence beyond the PRC to international markets by working with international pharmaceutical companies to cross-sell our products. 
Acquiring Complementary Products Lines, Technologies, Distribution Networks and Companies. We intend to selectively pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that we believe will grow our customer base, expand our product lines and distribution network, enhance our manufacturing and technical expertise or otherwise complement our business or further our strategic goals. Pursuing strategic acquisitions is a significant component of our growth strategy. The Company has not identified any strategic acquisition opportunities as of the date of this report on Form 10-K.

Due to the nature of the pharmaceutical industry, we continually strive to change our product portfolio to respond to changes in market demand. Based on a foundation established by a number of our widely-recognized prescription products, such as Cefaclor and Roxithromycin, we have launched and will continue to launch a variety of pharmaceuticals. The core criteria for our selection of potential pipeline products are strong market demand, proven efficacy, and safety. In an effort to gain an advantage in the marketplace, we often seek to improve the production process of the new generic products we elect to manufacture or to improve the quality of a proposed product to increase its efficacy.
 
We also adjust the delivery systems and marketing for each of our products based on the product’s target patient group. We believe that maintaining a variety of delivery systems (e.g. tablets, capsules, injectables and dry powders) for certain of our products targeted at different groups enhances our competitive position in the marketplace. As a result, our sales and marketing personnel work closely with management and our research and development personnel to determine which of our products can successfully be marketed for more than one delivery system and which generic drugs in the marketplace may be good candidates for us to manufacture and distribute using different delivery systems.
 
Product Development
 
Research & development and innovation represent the core competitive advantage for a company’s sustainable growth. For pharmaceutical companies, products with proprietary intellectual property are not only strategic resources for comprehensive strength, but also important tools to engage in social responsibility. We have been focusing on the research and development of both first generic drugs and innovative drugs. Additionally, we also have actively worked to meet unsatisfied medical needs by sticking to a market-oriented approach and continuously improving the effectiveness and ease of use of our drugs, supported by a well-designed system for intellectual property management.
 
The PRC State Council issued “Opinions on Carrying out Consistency Evaluation on Quality and Efficacy of Generic Drugs” on March 5, 2016, requiring all manufacturers of generic chemical pipeline products to carry out Consistency Evaluations before they may obtain final registration approval. Drugs failing to meet these requirements may not be re-registered.
 
Currently, due to this newly issued policy, as with all other Chinese generic pharmaceutical companies, the NMPA production approved standards and experimental requirements for almost all of our pipeline products have undergone major adjustments.
 
The Company's recent research and development work is mainly aimed at promoting the consistency evaluation of several major products already on the market, as well as the continued exploration of comprehensive health product categories.

Distribution and Customers
 
We believe we have a well-established sales network. As our current pharmaceutical product portfolio is comprised mainly of prescription drugs, our major sales targets are hospitals. As of December 31, 2020, we also have 16 sales offices covering all major provinces of China, and over 1,000 sales representatives who assist in managing many of our relationships with hospitals, doctors and local drug distributors.
 
Due to the nature of our products and current governmental regulations, all of our customers are located in the PRC. We have established long-standing relationships with most of our key customers through our operating subsidiary, Helpson, which was formed in 1993.
 

Production Facilities
 
We manufacture and package our products at our manufacturing facility in the Haikou Free Trade Zone in Haikou, Hainan Province. Our old manufacturing facility, which was built in 2002, is approximately 8,000 square meters; and our new building, approximately 20,000 square meters, was completed in 2013. We have production lines with the 2011 version of GMP certificates for different forms of our products including: tablets, capsules, dry power, liquid injectables, solid oral solution Cephalosporins (specifically designated).
 
All of our existing production lines have met the GMP Standards which became effective as of March 1, 2011. On December 1, 2019 the newly revised Drug Administration Law (the “New Law”) came into effect, which cancelled the GMP certification but impose the pilot inspection mechanism.
 
Raw Materials
 
We require a supply of a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products. We employ purchasing staff with extensive knowledge of our products who work with our product development, and formulations and quality control personnel to source raw materials for our products. Currently, we rely on numerous suppliers in the PRC and overseas to deliver our required raw materials and believe we have at least three principal suppliers for each of our most critical raw materials. Historically, we have not had difficulty obtaining raw materials from suppliers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our purchases of raw material purchases from our three top suppliers accounted for 20.7%, 17.7%, and 13.5%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019 suppliers accounted for 22.3%, 20.6% and 5.8%, respectively.
Competition
 
We believe we have established a commercially competitive position in the highly-fragmented pharmaceutical industry in China through our core competitive advantages, as described below:
 
We have a highly-efficient commercialization process for new products, including significant experience with the NMPA registration process.
 
We have over 20 years of product-development experience during which time we have implemented processes to efficiently introduce and market new and existing products to the Chinese market. 
 
We have a market-oriented product portfolio and product lines.
 
Our product focus is on developing and manufacturing medicines that help large patient groups, such as the infectious disease and cardio vascular disease patient groups. Our diversified GMP-certified manufacturing facility includes various production lines targeting a variety of delivery mechanisms, such as tablets, capsules, cephalosprine tablets, cephalosprine capsules, liquid-injectables and dry powder injectables, which enables us to effectively manufacture a broad range of new drugs.
 
We have product diversification to target specific sub-markets.
 
We attempt to differentiate our products from those of our competitors by changing, and, in many cases, improving certain physical aspects of our products to market to different market segments. For example, to make our Cefaclor product more patient friendly to children and patients with swallowing problems, we added an enteric coating to make our tablets easier to swallow.
 
9



We have a national sales network and a highly-trained marketing team.
 
Our experienced sales team has the industry knowledge and know-how to synergistically combine our strong market insight with a successful commercialization platform.
 
We have developed high-quality relationships with leading hospital and clinic administrators and physicians.
 
While sales of our pharmaceutical products to hospitals are made through our distributors, we believe our long-term relationships with leading hospitals and healthcare clinics throughout China resulting from our long-term promotional efforts and periodic physician seminars improve the perception of our products in the marketplace and help us identify and select high-volume drugs to develop into new generic products relatively early in the process.
 
Notwithstanding such favorable positioning, we are subject to intense competition. There are both local and overseas pharmaceutical enterprises that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of potential substitute or similar pharmaceutical products in the PRC. These competitors may have more capital, better research and development resources, better manufacturing and marketing capability, and more experience than we do.
 
Our profitability may be adversely affected if:
 

● | the number of our competitors increases; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | competitors engage in increased price competition; or 
● | competitors develop new products or product substitutes having comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic effects that are more effective, less costly and/or have more perceived benefits than those produced by us.

 
In addition, imported products and China’s admission as a member of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”) creates increased competition. The PRC became a member of the WTO in December 2001. As a result, competition in the pharmaceutical industry in the PRC intensified generally in two respects. First, with lower import tariffs, imported pharmaceutical products manufactured overseas may become increasingly competitive in terms of pricing. Second, we believe that well-established foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers may set up production facilities in the PRC and compete with domestic manufacturers directly. With the expected increased supply of competitively-priced pharmaceutical products in the PRC, we may face increased competition from foreign pharmaceutical products, especially in terms of high-end pharmaceutical products, including certain types of products manufactured by U.S. manufacturers.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our packaging designs, trademarks, trade secrets, patent and similar intellectual property as parts of our core competence that are critical to our success. We rely on patent, trademark and trade secret law, as well as confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees, distributors and others to protect our intellectual property rights.
 
In November 2008, we purchased the patented medical formula for a cerebral/cardio-vascular indication and the manufacturing processes for that product from a third party laboratory. In connection with that acquisition, we obtained the title of the patent. This patent expires in 2025.
 
In 2012, we acquired another patent related to a medical formula for the treatment of cerebral/cardio-vascular diseases. This patent expires in 2029.

Environmental Matters
 
We comply with the Environmental Protection Law of China as well as applicable local regulations. In addition to statutory and regulatory compliance, we actively ensure the environmental sustainability of our operations. Penalties may be levied upon us if we fail to adhere to and maintain certain standards. Such failure has not occurred in the past, and we do not anticipate that it will occur in the future, but no assurance can be given in this regard.
Regulations
 
Regulations Relating to Pharmaceutical Industry. The pharmaceutical industry in China is highly regulated. The primary regulatory authority is the NMPA, including its provincial and local branches. As a developer and producer of medicinal products, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the NMPA and its provincial and local branches. The Law of the PRC on the Administration of Pharmaceuticals provides the basic legal framework for the administration of the production and sale of pharmaceuticals in China and covers the manufacturing, distribution, packaging, pricing and advertising of pharmaceutical products. These regulations set forth detailed rules with respect to the administration of pharmaceuticals in China. We are also subject to other PRC laws and regulations that are applicable to business operators, manufacturers and distributors in general.
 
Registration and Approval of Medicine. Pursuant to the PRC Provisions for Drug Registration, a medicine must be registered and approved by the NMPA before it can be manufactured and sold. The registration and approval process requires the manufacturer to submit to the NMPA a registration application containing detailed information concerning the efficacy and quality of the medicine and the manufacturing process and the production facilities the manufacturer expects to use. A series of policies on consistency evaluation and drug review process have been issued in recent years, and potentially more reforms and adjustments are underway in order to promote the pharmaceutical industry in China in line with the international standards. In this context, we believe that the uncertainties in the timetables for obtaining NMPA production approvals for products under research are increasing. If a manufacturer chooses to manufacture a pre-clinical medicine, it is also required to conduct pre-clinical trials, apply to the NMPA for permission to conduct clinical trials and go through the clinical trials. If a manufacturer chooses to manufacture a post-clinical medicine, it only needs to go through the clinical trials. In both cases, a manufacturer needs to file clinical data with the NMPA for approval for manufacturing after clinical trials are completed.
 
New Medicine. If a new medicine is approved by the NMPA, the NMPA will issue a new medicine certificate to the manufacturer and impose a monitoring period of one to five years. During the monitoring period, the NMPA will monitor the safety of the new medicine, and will neither accept new medicine certificate applications for an identical medicine by another pharmaceutical company, nor approve the production or import of an identical medicine by other pharmaceutical companies. As a result of these regulations, the holder of a new medicine certificate has the exclusive right to manufacture it during the monitoring period. We currently have the new medicine certificates for our Pusenouke, Cefaclor dispersible tablets and Roxithromycin dispersible tablets and Bumetanide for injection products.
National Production Standard and Provisional Standard. In connection with the NMPA’s approval of a new medicine, the NMPA will normally direct the manufacturer to produce the medicine according to a provisional national production standard, or a provisional standard. A provisional standard is valid for two years, during which time the NMPA closely monitors the production process and quality consistency of the medicine to develop a national final production standard for the medicine, or a final standard. Three months before the expiration of the two-year period, the manufacturer is required to apply to the NMPA to convert the provisional standard to a final standard. Upon approval, the NMPA will publish the final standard for production. The NMPA has no statutory timeline to complete its review and grant approval for the conversion. In practice, the approval for conversion to a final standard is time-consuming and could take a number of years. However, during the NMPA’s review period, the manufacturer may continue to produce the medicine according to the provisional standard.
Transitional Period. Prior to the latter of (1) the expiration of a new medicine’s monitoring period or (2) the date when the NMPA grants a final standard for a new medicine after the expiration of the provisional standard, the NMPA will not accept applications for an identical medicine nor will it approve the production of an identical medicine by other pharmaceutical companies. Accordingly, the manufacturer will continue to have an exclusive production right for the new medicine during this transitional period.

Continuing NMPA Regulation
 
Pharmaceutical manufacturers in China are subject to continuing regulation by the NMPA. If the labeling or its manufacturing process of an approved medicine is significantly modified, a new pre-market approval or pre-market approval supplement will be required by the NMPA. A pharmaceutical manufacturer is subject to periodic inspection and safety monitoring by the NMPA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements.
 
The NMPA has a variety of enforcement actions available to enforce its regulations and rules, including fines and injunctions, recall or seizure of products, the imposition of operating restrictions, partial suspension or complete shutdown of production and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical Product Manufacturing
 
Permits and Licenses for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers. A pharmaceutical manufacturer must obtain a pharmaceutical manufacturing permit from the NMPA’s relevant provincial branch. This permit is valid for five years and is renewable for an additional five-year period upon its expiration. Our current pharmaceutical manufacturing permit, issued by the NMPA, will expire on November 8, 2025. We are confident the permit could be renewed before its expiration.
Good Manufacturing Practice. A pharmaceutical manufacturer must meet the Good Manufacturing Practice standards, or GMP standards, for each of its production facilities in China in respect of each form of pharmaceutical product it produces. GMP standards include staff qualifications, production premises and facilities, equipment, raw materials, environmental hygiene, production management, quality control and customer complaint administration. Prior to December 1, 2019, if a manufacturer meets the GMP standards, the NMPA will issue to the manufacturer a Good Manufacturing Practice certificate, or a GMP certificate, with a five-year validity period. However, for a newly-established pharmaceutical manufacturer that meets the GMP standards, the NMPA will issue a GMP certificate with only a one-year validity period. The Year 2011 GMP Standards became effective on March 1, 2011, and pharmaceutical manufacturers (except for manufacturers of injectables, blood products or vaccines, which had a three-year grace period) had a five-year grace period to upgrade existing facilities to comply with the revisions.
 
All of our existing production lines have met the Year 2011 GMP Standards. On December 1, 2019, the newly revised Drug Administration Law (the “New Law”) came into effect. One of the major amendments is the cancellation of GMP certification. The New Law eliminated the requirement that drug administration authorities shall assess drug manufacture enterprises and drug trading enterprises, and issue assessment certificates. Instead, it requires that drug manufacturing enterprises and drug trading enterprises establish and improve the quality management systems of manufacture and trade of drugs, and ensure that the process of manufacturing and trading of drugs always meets all legal requirements. This means a stricter form of supervision is implemented comparing to the prior GMP certificates system and our production lines are subject pilot inspection under the New Law.
 
Product Liability and Consumers Protection
 
Product liability claims may arise if any of our pharmaceutical products have a harmful effect on a consumer, who may make a claim for damages or compensation as an injured party. The General Principles of the Civil Law of the PRC, which became effective in January 1987, state that manufacturers and sellers of defective products causing property damage or injury shall incur civil liabilities for such damage or injuries.
 
The Product Quality Law of the PRC was enacted in 1993 and amended in 2000 to strengthen the quality control of products and protect consumers’ rights and interests. Under this law, manufacturers and distributors who produce or sell defective products may be subject to confiscation of earnings from such sales, revocation of business licenses and imposition of fines, and in severe circumstances, may be subject to criminal liability.
 
The Law of the PRC on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers was promulgated on October 31, 1993 and became effective on January 1, 1994 to protect consumers when they purchase or use goods or services. All business operators must comply with this law when they manufacture or sell goods and/or provide services to customers. In extreme situations, pharmaceutical product manufacturers and distributors may be subject to criminal liability if their goods or services lead to the death or injuries of customers or other third parties.

Price Controls
 
Since October 2015, with the approval of the State Council, 16 ministries (bureaus) including the Health and Family Planning Commission have established departmental coordination mechanisms and organized the first batch of pilot national drug price negotiations. Thereafter, the dynamic adjustment of the national health insurance catalogue began. In the past five years, China has gradually established a dynamic adjustment mechanism for basic medical insurance drugs and optimized the structure of drugs in the catalogue.
 
For the health care negotiations, the health insurance fund plays a "strategic buyer" role and uses "quantity-for-price" to create a significant drop in drug costs. The adjustment of the health insurance catalogue focuses on improving the efficiency of the use of health insurance funds and using limited resources to maximize the clinical benefits of patients.
 
In July 2020, the State Administration of Health Insurance issued the Interim Measures for the Administration of Drug Use in Basic Medical Insurance, which further clarified the establishment and improvement of the dynamic adjustment mechanism In principle, the catalogue will be adjusted once a year.
 
In addition, the State also organizes centralized procurement of medicines. With a large number of procurement, the State is able to obtain high-quality low-cost drugs. The General Office of the State Council issued the Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Normal Institutionalization of Centralized Procurement of Drugs on January 28, 2021.
 
In the future, certain generic drugs will be selected to enter the centralized procedure after a consistency evaluation, result in a significant price reduction in exchange for sales volume.
 
Other Regulations
 
In addition to the regulations relating to pharmaceutical industry in China, we are also subject to the regulations applicable to a foreign invested enterprise in China.
Foreign Currency Exchange. Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules promulgated in 1996 and amended in 1997 and various regulations issued by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or the SAFE, and other relevant PRC government authorities, Renminbi is freely convertible only to the extent of current account items, such as trade-related receipts and payments, interests and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, require the prior approval from the SAFE or its local counterpart for conversion of Renminbi into a foreign currency, such as U.S. dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside the PRC.
 
Payments for transactions that take place within the PRC must be made in Renminbi. Unless otherwise approved, PRC companies other than foreign investment enterprises (FIEs) must convert foreign currency payments they receive from abroad into Renminbi. On the other hand, FIEs may retain foreign currency in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks, subject to a cap set by the SAFE or its local counterpart.
 
Dividend Distribution. Under the PRC regulations governing dividend distributions by wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures, wholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, these foreign-invested enterprises are required to set aside certain amounts of their accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 248 employees, among which 237 employees were full-time employees and 11 employees were temporary employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and, in general, we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 
As required by applicable Chinese law, we have entered into employment contracts with substantially all of our officers, managers and employees. We are working towards entering into employment contracts with those employees who do not currently have employment contracts with us. The PRC enacted a new Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008. We have updated our employment contracts and employee handbook and are in compliance with such law.
