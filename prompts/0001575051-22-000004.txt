Item 1. Business
Overview
The Partnership was formed in April 2013 by SCW LLC. The Partnership owns a controlling interest comprised of 51.0% membership interest in Sisecam Wyoming, which is one of the largest and lowest cost producers of natural soda ash in the world, serving a global market from our facility in the Green River Basin of Wyoming. Our facility has been in operation for more than 50 years.
The following table sets forth certain operating data regarding our business:
 | Year Ended December 31, 
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019 | 2018 | | 2017 
Operating and Other Data: | (thousands of short tons, except for ratio data)
Trona ore consumed | 4,251.2 | | 3,653.8 | | 4,157.0 | 4,018.3 | | 4,001.3 
Ore to ash ratio(1) | 1.56: 1.0 | | 1.60: 1.0 | | 1.51: 1.0 | 1.54: 1.0 | | 1.50: 1.0
Ore grade(2) | 86.3 | % | | 86.6 | % | 86.6 | % | | 85.8 | % | 88.4 | %
Soda ash volume produced | 2,720.5 | | 2,279.3 | | 2,752.0 | 2,613.4 | | 2,666.9 
Soda ash volume sold | 2,813.5 | | 2,221.9 | | 2,759.1 | 2,613.2 | | 2,705.4 

(1)Ore to ash ratio expresses the number of short tons of trona ore used to produce one short ton of soda ash and liquor and includes our deca rehydration recovery process. In general, a lower ore to ash ratio results in lower costs and improved efficiency. 
(2)Ore grade is the percentage of raw trona ore that is recoverable as soda ash free of impurities.  A higher ore grade will produce more soda ash than a lower ore grade.  
Trona, a naturally occurring soft mineral, is also known as sodium sesquicarbonate and consists primarily of sodium carbonate, or soda ash, sodium bicarbonate and water. We process trona ore into soda ash, which is an essential raw material in flat glass, container glass, detergents, chemicals, paper and other consumer and industrial products. The vast majority of the world’s accessible trona reserves are located in the Green River Basin. According to historical production statistics, approximately 30% of global soda ash is produced by processing trona, with the remainder being produced synthetically through chemical processes. The processing of soda ash from trona is the cheapest manner in which to produce soda ash. The costs associated with procuring the materials needed for synthetic production are greater than the costs associated with mining trona for trona-based production. In addition, trona-based production consumes less energy and produces fewer undesirable by-products than synthetic production.

Change in Control of Sisecam Chemicals
On December 21, 2021, Ciner Enterprises (which was the indirect owner of approximately 74% of the common units in the Partnership and 100% of the general partner), completed the following transactions pursuant to the definitive agreement which Ciner Enterprises entered into with Sisecam USA, a direct subsidiary of Şişecam Parent on November 20, 2021 (“Purchase Agreement”):
•Ciner Enterprises converted Ciner Resources Corporation into Sisecam Chemicals Resources LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Sisecam Chemicals"), and Ciner Wyoming Holding Co., a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Sisecam Chemicals, into Sisecam Chemicals Wyoming LLC (“SCW LLC”), with SCW LLC in turn then directly owning approximately 74% of the common units in the Partnership and 100% of the general partner (collectively, the “Reorganization Transactions”);

•subsequent to the Reorganization Transactions, Ciner Enterprises sold to Sisecam USA, and Sisecam USA purchased, 60% of the outstanding units of Sisecam Chemicals owned by Ciner Enterprises for a purchase price of $300 million (the “Sisecam Chemicals Sale”); and
•at the closing of the Sisecam Chemicals Sale, Sisecam Chemicals, Ciner Enterprises, and Sisecam USA entered into a unitholders and operating agreement (the “Sisecam Chemicals Operating Agreement”) (collectively such transactions, the “CoC Transaction”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Sisecam Chemicals Operating Agreement, Sisecam USA and Ciner Enterprises have a right to designate six directors and four directors, respectively, to the board of directors of Sisecam Chemicals. In addition, the Sisecam Chemicals Operating Agreement provides that (i) the board of directors of the general partner (the “MLP Board”) shall consist of six designees from Sisecam USA, two designees from Ciner Enterprises and three independent directors for as long as the general partner is legally required to appoint such independent directors and (ii) the Partnership’s right to appoint four managers to the board of managers of Sisecam Wyoming (the “Wyoming Board”) shall be comprised of three designees from Sisecam USA and one designee from Ciner Enterprises. Each of Sisecam USA and Ciner Enterprises shall vote all units over which such unitholder has voting control in Sisecam Chemicals to elect to the board of directors any individual designated by Sisecam USA and Ciner Enterprises. The Sisecam Chemicals Operating Agreement also requires the board of directors of Sisecam Chemicals to unanimously approve certain actions and commitments, including without limitation taking any action that would have an adverse effect on the master limited partnership status of the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries. As a result of Sisecam USA’s and Ciner Enterprise’s respective interests in Sisecam Chemicals and their respective rights under the Sisecam Chemicals Operating Agreement, each of Ciner Enterprises and Sisecam USA and their respective beneficial owners may be deemed to share beneficial ownership of the approximate 2% general partner interest in the Partnership and approximately 74% of the common units in the Partnership owned directly by SCW LLC and indirectly by Sisecam Chemicals as parent entity of SCW LLC.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths better enable us to execute our business strategies and to achieve our objective of generating and growing cash available for distribution to our unitholders:
Safety Is a Value and the Most Important Part of Our Business.  We pride ourselves on our safety record, and we are continually one of the leaders in the U.S. mining industry in relation to low incident rates and workplace injuries. We maintain a rigorous safety program, which includes training, site audits and hazard identification. Sisecam Chemicals and its affiliates, our employees and all contractors who operate our assets or work at our facility are involved in our safety programs. As a direct result of this commitment, we have achieved many recognitions such as the Sentinels of Safety by the National Mining Association, The Industrial Minerals Association-North America Safety Achievement Award (Large Category) five times, most recently in September of 2021 at the Fall Industrial Minerals Association-North America Conference, Safe Sam Award by the Wyoming Mining Association two times, most recently June 2021, and the Wyoming State Mine Inspector’s Large Mine award multiple times. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our facility had one lost work day injury and three recordable injuries as reported by Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”). We also boast and support some of the best rescue teams in the country. In 2021, our Mine Rescue team competed in the Southwest Wyoming Mutual Aid competition. With 15 teams in attendance, Sisecam’s Mine Rescue team made a clean sweep of the competition including, overall champion, while also placing first in the field, team tech, bench and first aid competition. There were, however, no surface rescue contests or national mine rescue contests in 2021 due to coronavirus (“COVID-19”).
Cost Advantages of Producing Soda Ash from Trona.    We believe that as a producer of soda ash from trona, we have a significant competitive advantage compared to the synthetically produced soda ash manufactured in other parts of the world. The manufacturing and processing costs for producing soda ash from trona are lower than other manufacturing techniques partly because the costs associated with procuring the materials needed for synthetic production are greater than the costs associated with mining trona for trona-based production. In addition, trona-based production consumes less energy and produces fewer undesirable by-products than synthetic production. We believe the average cost of production per short ton of soda ash (before freight and logistics costs) from trona, directly in relationship with the production methods, has a significant cost advantage when compared to synthetic production. In addition, synthetic producers of soda ash incur additional costs associated with storing or disposing of, or attempting to resell, the by-products the synthetic processes produce. Even after taking into account the higher freight costs associated with our soda ash exports, we believe we can be cost competitive with synthetic soda ash operations in most parts of the world, which are typically located closer to customers than we are. Today, we estimate that roughly 30% of global production is produced from trona-based sources, while the remainder is produced using various synthetic methods.
Synergies created from Ciner Group and Sisecam Group.  The Partnership is partly owned indirectly by the Ciner Group, which is one of the largest global producers of natural soda ash derived from trona-based sources. We are one of the lowest cost producers of soda ash in the global market that has historically seen demand for soda ash exceed supply of soda ash. In addition, Şişecam Parent and its subsidiaries (the “Sisecam Group”) and the Ciner Group (collectively “Sponsors”), have international logistics experience and operating assets that assist the Partnership. As previously discussed and disclosed in the later sections of this Form 10-K, Sisecam Chemicals terminated its ANSAC membership at the end of day on December 31, 2020 to improve access to customers and gain control over placement of its sales in the international marketplace. As of January 1, 2021, Sisecam Chemicals began 

managing the Partnership's sales and marketing efforts for exports with the ANSAC exit being complete. With the ability to leverage our Sponsors' logistics expertise and extensive global presence and network, we have adequately replaced these net ANSAC sales.
Sisecam Group has undertaken major efforts to become an international company with its growing production power, reputable brand image, high product quality and value-creating sustainable growth approach. The company is currently one of the world's leading glass and soda ash producers with production operations located in 14 countries on four continents and more than 22,000 employees. Sisecam Group records sales in over 150 countries around the globe.
In 1969, Sisecam Group began producing soda ash and has made significant inroads to expand its investment portfolio in existing and adjacent markets ever since. Today, Sisecam Group has 2.5 million tons of soda production capacity excluding the Partnership. Sisecam Group has more than 50 years of soda production experience and nearly 85 years of industrial mining experience. It also has more than 16 years of cogeneration plant knowledge. Research and development activities conducted by Sisecam Group regarding soda and its derivatives can be utilized in the Partnership, and we believe those efforts could provide a competitive advantage for our U.S. operations. We also believe that the lean operations and continuous improvement activities of Sisecam Group can create synergies and opportunities for further optimization in the U.S.
Sisecam Group has long-standing relationships with many global customers. Sisecam Group generates 70% of its soda revenue, excluding from the Partnership, through international sales. With such extensive access to global soda markets, we believe Sisecam Group will significantly contribute to building and amplifying the sales capabilities of the Partnership. The Partnership’s customer relationships can be expanded by leveraging Sisecam Group’s existing sales networks and customer portfolios, which we believe will facilitate securing and servicing accounts, especially those in the international market.
With its extensive experience in the soda market and technical fields, along with the Sisecam Group’s significant investment history in various forms (e.g., greenfield, joint venture and sole ownership), we believe that Sisecam Group will positively contribute to the U.S. operations.
Substantial Reserve Life from Significant Reserves.  Our reserve estimate, as of December 31, 2021, was prepared by Hollberg Professional Group (“HPG”), an independent mining and geological consulting firm. As of December 31, 2021, HPG estimated we had proven and probable reserves of approximately 220.0 million short tons of trona, which is equivalent to 119.1 million short tons of soda ash. Based on our current mining rate of approximately 4.0 million short tons of trona per year, we believe we have enough proven and probable trona reserves to continue mining trona using current methods in excess of 50 years. Please see Item 1, Business, “Summary of Trona Resources and Trona Reserves” and “Risk Factors-Risks Inherent in our Business and Industry - Our reserve and resource data are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions that may change in the future, which could materially and adversely affect the quantities and value of our reserves and resources” for more information. 
Certain Operational Advantages Compared to Other U.S. Trona-Based Producers. We believe we have certain operational advantages over other soda ash producers in the Green River Basin due to the operational characteristics of our facilities as described below. These advantages are manifested in our high productivity and efficiency rates.
•Location of our mining beds and high purity trona.  Our mining beds are located 800 to 1,100 feet below the surface, which is significantly closer to the surface than the mining beds of other operators in the Green River Basin. The relatively shallow depth of our beds compared to other Green River Basin trona mines contributes to favorable ground conditions and improved mining efficiency. We have a competitive advantage because we can mine the trona and roof bolt simultaneously on our continuous miner equipment. In addition, the trona in our mining beds has a higher concentration of soda ash as compared to the trona mined at other locations in the Green River Basin, which is typically imbedded or mixed with greater amounts of halite and other impurities. Our trona ore is generally composed of approximately 80% to 89% pure trona.
•Advantageous facility layout.  Our surface site includes a high-capacity network of ponds that we use to recapture soda ash lost in processing trona through a process we introduced in 2009 called deca rehydration (“deca”). While other producers in the Green River Basin also utilize deca rehydration, our pond complex enables us to spread deca-saturated water over a large surface area, which facilitates evaporation and access to the resulting deca. Additionally, we can transfer water from one pond to another, a process we call “de-watering,” leaving the first pond dry. De-watering enables us to use front loaders and other hauling equipment to move dry deca from that “de-watered” pond to our processing facility. Other producers in the area instead need to utilize costly dredging techniques to extract deca from their ponds, and the recovered deca is wet, and therefore requires more energy to process than dry deca. Introducing dry deca into our process has also reduced our energy consumption per short ton of soda ash produced. At our current utilization rates, we will deplete our deca supply in 2024. Please read “Risk Factors-Risks Inherent in Our Business and Industry-Our deca stockpiles will substantially deplete by 2024 and our production rates will decline approximately 200,000 short tons per year if we do not make further investments” for more information about this process. 
Partly due to these operational advantages over other domestic producers, we believe we have the most efficient soda ash production facility in the Green River Basin both in terms of short tons of soda ash produced per employee and in energy 

consumed per short ton of soda ash produced. In 2021, we used approximately 4.0 MMBtus of energy per short ton of soda ash processed, as compared to an average of 5.5 MMBtus of energy for the other three operators in the Green River Basin according to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (“WDEQ”) and our internal estimates. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we produced approximately 6,072 short tons of soda ash per employee. 
Stable Domestic Customer Relationships.  We have more than 70 domestic customers in industries such as flat glass, container glass, detergents, chemicals and other consumer and industrial products. We have long-term relationships with many of our customers due to our competitive pricing, reliable shipping and high-quality soda ash. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the majority of our domestic net sales were made to customers with whom we have done business for over ten years and their contracts are typically for one to three year periods. We believe that these relationships promote more stable cash flows. 
Experienced Management and Workforce.   Our facility has been in continuous operation for more than 50 years. We are able to build on the collective knowledge gained from our experience during this period to continually improve our operations and introduce innovative processes. In addition, many members of Sisecam Wyoming’s senior management team have more than 15 years of relevant industry experience. Our executives lead a highly productive workforce with an average tenure of approximately 12 years. We believe our institutional knowledge, coupled with the relative seniority of our workforce, engenders a strong sense of teamwork and collegiality, which has led to one of the safest and most efficient operations in the industry today.
Our Business Strategies
Our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows through consistent growth in the production of soda ash, allowing us to make quarterly cash distributions to our common unitholders while growing our business. To achieve our objective, we intend to execute the following key business strategies:
Capitalize on Expected Growth in Demand for Soda Ash. Since 2013, we have invested just over $79.3 million for debottlenecking projects that have improved our annual production capacity by approximately 320,000 tons of soda ash per year. In connection with the CoC Transaction, we believe we have further opportunities to debottleneck our facility and are incorporating several of these in our holistic approach as we further explore whether to proceed with the Green River Expansion Project that, should we decide to proceed, we believe could increase production levels up to approximately 3.5 million tons of soda ash. We believe that as one of the leading low-cost producers of trona-based soda ash, we are well-positioned to capitalize on the expected worldwide growth of soda ash. While consumption of soda ash within the United States is expected to remain relatively flat in the near future, overall worldwide demand for soda ash, based on third-party historical production statistics and estimates, was 62.7 million metric tons (equivalent to approximately 69.1 million short tons) in 2021 and was forecasted to be 66.1 million metric tons (equivalent to approximately 72.9 million short tons) in 2022. The soda ash market is currently projected to recover from slow demand in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and grow to almost 72.0 million metric tons (equivalent to approximately 79.4 million short tons) in 2026, which represents a compounded annual growth rate of 2.8%. The ANSAC exit allowed Sisecam Chemicals to improve access to customers and gain control over placement of its sales in the international marketplace in 2021. This enhanced view of the global market allows Sisecam Chemicals to better understand supply/demand fundamentals thus allowing better decision making for its business. Sisecam Chemicals continues to optimize its distribution network leveraging strengths of existing distribution partners while expanding as our business requires in certain target areas. Please read “Customers” below for a discussion about our withdrawal from ANSAC.
Continuous Improvement Initiatives to Lower our Operating Expenses and Increase Utilization. We have been building a culture of continuous improvement. For example, several initiatives have been undertaken to reduce our overall costs to produce soda ash and increase the overall output of the facility. In 2021, the Continuous Improvement initiatives were able to transform ideas from employees into multiple projects throughout the site that resulted in an overall savings of approximately $1 million.
Leverage our Sponsors’ Capability to Build a Global Soda Ash Brand. Both of our Sponsors’ platforms include unique low cost technology, logistics assets including ports and bulk ships, and world class cost competitive production assets geographically located to serve most key markets around the world. In addition, upon Sisecam Chemicals’ termination from ANSAC (as discussed further under “Customers” below), Sisecam Chemicals is marketing soda ash directly into international markets that are currently being served by ANSAC and is utilizing the logistics expertise and extensive global presence and network that has already been established by the Sponsors. 
Build a Global Soda Ash Brand.  Sisecam Chemicals leveraged Ciner Group’s distribution network upon the ANSAC exit in 2021. Sisecam Chemicals adapted this model to best serve its own requirements in the target markets of our soda ash sales. Sisecam Chemicals built relationships and established its own reputation as a seller in these markets by negotiating agreements and demonstrating supply capabilities with large and midsize consumers directly selling through distribution. These direct relationships allowed Sisecam Chemicals to establish its customer base for current and future sales.
Maintain Financial Flexibility.  We intend to maintain a disciplined financial policy and conservative capital structure by balancing the funding of expansion capital expenditures and acquisitions with internally generated operating cash flows and external 

financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt” for additional information.
Expand Operations Strategically.   In addition to capacity expansions and process improvements at our current facility, we plan to grow our business through various methods as they become available to us. This would include acquisitions of other businesses that are involved in mining and processing minerals, such as soda ash, and logistics assets that could improve our efficiencies and grow our cash flows. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Green River Expansion Project” for additional information.
We can provide no assurance that we will be able to utilize our strengths described above. For further discussion of the risks that we face, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Our Organizational Structure
The following chart depicts our ownership structure as of March 14, 2022 and approximate ownership percentages:
Our Operations
Our Green River Basin surface operations are situated on approximately 2,360 acres in Wyoming (of which, 880 acres are owned), and our mining operations consist of approximately 23,500 acres of leased and licensed subsurface mining area. Our facility is accessible by both road and rail. We use seven large continuous mining machines and fourteen underground shuttle cars in our mining operations. Our processing assets consist primarily of material sizing units, conveyors, calciners, dissolver circuits, thickener tanks, drum filters, evaporators and rotary dryers.
The following map provides an aerial overview of our surface operations:

The following map shows the known sodium leasing area within the Green River Basin, including the boundaries of our leased and licensed subsurface mining area:

The Green River Basin geological formation holds the largest, and one of the highest purity, known deposits of trona ore in the world. Our reserves contain trona deposits having a purity between 80% to 89% by weight, which means that insoluble impurities and water make up approximately 11% to 20% of our trona. 
Our mining leases and license are located in two mining beds, designated by the U.S. Geological Survey as beds 24 and 25, at depths of 800 to 1100 feet, respectively, below the surface. Mining these beds affords us several competitive advantages. First, the 

depth of our beds is shallower than other actively mined beds in the Green River Basin, which allows us to use a continuous mining technique to mine trona and roof bolt the ceiling simultaneously. In addition, mining two beds that are on top of one another allows for production efficiencies because we are able to use a single hoisting shaft to service both beds.
The following graphic shows a cross-section of the strategic areas of the Green River Basin where we mine trona:
 Source: Management.
We remove insoluble materials and other impurities by thickening and filtering the liquor. We then add activated carbon to our filters to remove organic impurities, which can cause color contamination in the final product. The resulting clear liquid is then crystallized in evaporators, producing sodium carbonate monohydrate. The crystals are then drawn off and passed through a centrifuge to remove excess water. We then dry the resulting material in a product dryer to form anhydrous sodium carbonate, or soda ash. The resulting processed soda ash is then stored in on-site storage silos to await shipment by bulk rail or truck to distributors and end customers. Our storage silos can hold up to 58,900 short tons of processed soda ash at any given time. Our facility is in good working condition and has been in service for more than 50 years.
Deca Rehydration.    The evaporation stage of our trona ore processing produces a precipitate and natural by-product called deca. Deca, short for sodium carbonate decahydrate, is one part soda ash and ten parts water. Solar evaporation causes deca to crystallize and precipitate to the bottom of the four main surface ponds at our Green River Basin facility. In 2009, we implemented a process called deca rehydration, which enables us to recover soda ash from the deca-rich purged liquor as a by-product of our refining process. We capture the soda ash contained in deca by allowing the deca crystals to evaporate in the sun and separating the dehydrated crystals from the soda ash. We then blend the separated deca crystals with partially processed trona ore at the dissolving stage of our production process described above. This process enables us to reduce our waste storage needs and convert what is typically a waste product into a usable raw material. Please read “Risk Factor-Risks Inherent in Our Business and Industry-Our deca stockpiles will substantially deplete by 2024 and our production rates will decline approximately 200,000 short tons per year if we do not make further investments” for more information about this process. 
Energy Consumption.    We believe we have one of the most efficient mining and soda ash production surface operations in the world. During 2021, we used approximately 4.0 MMBtus of energy in the form of electricity and natural gas to produce each short ton of soda ash. In addition, we believe this to be the lowest energy consumption of any soda ash producer in North America. We and other producers of soda ash in the Green River Basin benefit from relatively low cost and stable supply of natural gas in Wyoming, which further enhances our competitive cost advantage over other regions of the world. To reduce the impact of the volatility in natural gas prices, we hedge a portion of our natural gas consumption requirements, which enables us to set the price for a portion of our forecasted natural gas purchases. During the first quarter of 2020, we completed construction of a natural gas-fired turbine co-generation facility that is capable of providing roughly one-third of our electricity and steam demands at our mine in the Green River Basin. This co-generation facility began operating in March 2020 and provided 172.6 million kWh of electricity which saved the 

Partnership $4.4 million in 2021 based on average purchased electricity costs and gas costs. In a normal production environment the facility is expected to provide us over 180.0 million kWh of electricity annually.
Shipping and Logistics.    All of our soda ash is shipped by rail or truck from our Green River Basin operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we shipped over 90% of our soda ash to our customers initially via a single rail line owned and controlled by Union Pacific Railroad Company (“Union Pacific”), and our plant receives rail service exclusively from Union Pacific. Our agreement with Union Pacific expires on December 31, 2025 and there can be no assurance that it will be renewed on terms favorable to us or at all. If we do not ship at least a significant portion of our soda ash production on the Union Pacific rail line during a twelve-month period, we must pay Union Pacific a shortfall payment under the terms of our transportation agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we assisted the majority of our domestic customers in arranging their freight services. During 2021, we had no shortfall payments and do not expect to make any such payments in the future.  Sisecam Chemicals leases a fleet of more than 2,200 hopper cars that serve as dedicated modes of shipment to our domestic and international customers. For non ANSAC exports, we ship our soda ash on unit trains primarily to Longview, Washington for bulk shipments. For the year ended December 31, 2021, ANSAC provided logistics and support services for a portion of our export sales primarily out of Portland, Oregon and Longview, Washington. From these ports, our soda ash is loaded onto ships for delivery to ports all over the world. For domestic sales, Sisecam Chemicals provides similar services. 
Customers
Our largest customer was ANSAC for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the sales to ANSAC accounted for approximately 21.1% of our net sales. The significant volume of sales to ANSAC for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily related to the terms of the ANSAC exit settlement agreement. No other individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales.
For customers in North America, Sisecam Chemicals, on our behalf, typically enters into contracts, having terms ranging from one to three years. Under these contracts, our customers generally agree to purchase either minimum estimated volumes of soda ash or a certain percentage of their estimated soda ash requirements at a fixed price for a given calendar year. Although we do not have a “take or pay” arrangement with our customers, substantially all of our sales are made pursuant to written agreements and not through spot sales. In 2021, we had more than 70 domestic customers and in general, we have long-term relationships with the majority of our customers, meaning we have been a supplier to them for more than ten years.
Our customers, including end users to whom ANSAC makes sales overseas, consist primarily of:
•Glass manufacturing companies, which account for 50% or more of the consumption of soda ash around the world; and 
•The majority of the remainder is comprised of chemical and detergent manufacturing companies.
Historically, by design and prior to Sisecam Chemicals’ exit from ANSAC, ANSAC managed most of our international sales, marketing and logistics, and as a result, was our largest customer for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, accounting for 45.4% and 60.4%, respectively, of our net sales. ANSAC takes soda ash orders directly from its overseas customers and then purchases soda ash for resale from its member companies pro rata based on each member’s allocated volumes. ANSAC is the exclusive distributor for its members to the markets it serves. The ANSAC exit allowed Sisecam Chemicals to improve access to customers and gain control over placement of its sales in the international marketplace in 2021. This enhanced view of the global market allows Sisecam Chemicals to better understand supply/demand fundamentals thus allowing better decision making for its business. Sisecam Chemicals continues to optimize its distribution network leveraging strengths of existing distribution partners while expanding as our business requires in certain target areas.
Leases and License
We are party to several mining leases and one license, as noted in the table below, which give us subsurface mining rights. Some of our leases are renewable at our option upon expiration. We pay royalties to the State of Wyoming, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and Sweetwater Royalties LLC, a subsidiary of Sweetwater Trona OpCo LLC and the successor in interest to the license with the Rock Spring Royalty Company, LLC (“RSRC”), an affiliate of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (formerly an affiliate of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation). The royalties are calculated based upon a percentage of the value of soda ash and related products sold at a certain stage in the mining process. These royalty payments may be subject to a minimum domestic production volume from our Green River Basin facility. We are also obligated to pay annual rentals to our lessors and licensor regardless of actual sales. In addition, we pay a production tax to Sweetwater County, and trona severance tax to the State of Wyoming that is calculated based on a formula that utilizes the volume of trona ore mined and the value of the soda ash produced. We have a perpetual right to continue operating under these leases and license as long as we maintain continuous mining operations and we intend to continue renewing the leases and license as has been historical practice.
The royalty rates we pay to our lessors and licensor may change upon our renewal or renegotiation of such leases and license. On June 28, 2018, Sisecam Wyoming amended its License Agreement, dated July 18, 1961 (the “License Agreement”), with a predecessor in interest to Sweetwater Royalties LLC, to, among other things, (i) extend the term of the License Agreement to July 18, 2061 and for so long thereafter as Sisecam Wyoming continuously conducts operations to mine and remove sodium minerals from the 

licensed premises in commercial quantities; and (ii) set the production royalty rate for each sale of sodium mineral products produced from ore extracted from the licensed premises at eight percent (8%) of the net sales of such sodium mineral products. Any increase in the royalty rates we are required to pay to our lessors and licensor, or any failure by us to renew any of our leases and license, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, and, therefore, may affect our ability to distribute cash to unitholders. On December 11, 2020, the Secretary of the Interior authorized an industry-wide royalty reduction from currently set rates by establishing a 2% federal royalty rate for a period of ten years for all existing and future federal soda ash or sodium bicarbonate leases. This change by the Secretary of the Interior reduced the rates on our mineral leases with the U.S. Government from 6% to 2% as of January 1, 2021 and for the following ten years. This 4% rate reduction saved over $6.5 million in royalty fees based on our mining operations in 2021. 
The following is a summary of the material terms of our leases and our license as of December 31, 2021:

The foregoing descriptions of the material terms of our leases and our license do not purport to be complete descriptions of our leases and our license, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the leases and license, as amended copies of which have been filed or incorporated by reference as exhibits to this Report. See Part IV, Item 15, “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules— Exhibit Index” for more information.
Trona Resources and Trona Reserves
Information concerning our mining property and estimated mineral resources and mineral reserves in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, which first became applicable to us for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. These requirements differ significantly from the previously applicable disclosure requirements of SEC Industry Guide 7. Among other differences, subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K requires us to disclose our mineral resources, in addition to our mineral reserves, at our mining property as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year. The information that follows is derived, for the most part, from, and in some instances is an extract from the technical report summary prepared by Hollberg Professional Group (HPG) in compliance with Item 601(b)(96) and subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Portions of the following information are based on assumptions, qualifications and procedures, that are not fully described herein. Reference should be made to the full text of the technical report summary prepared by HPG attached as Exhibit 96.1 and incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Report on Form 10-K. We have used the term “trona” as in “trona resources” and “trona reserves” interchangeably with “mineral.”
Hollberg Professional Group (HPG) has conducted an independent technical review of the lands held by Sisecam Chemicals referred to as the “Big Island Mine,” which is located in the area commonly referred to as the Know Sodium Lease Area (the “KSLA”) near the town of Green River, Sweetwater County. The KSLA is where trona thickness exceeds 1-meter, extends for over 300 km2, and is greater than 80% grade. The U.S. Geological Survey recognizes 25 trona beds of economic importance (at least 1 meter in thickness and 300 km2 in areal extent) within the Green River Basin. Identified in ascending order, the trona beds are numbered 1 through 25 from the oldest (stratigraphically lowest) to the youngest (stratigraphically highest). Sisecam Wyoming has approximately 23,612 acres of trona under lease made up of approximately 7,934 Federal acres, 3,079 State acres, and 12,439 private acres. Sisecam Chemicals has mineral resources and mineable reserves in the shallowest mechanically minable Trona Beds 24 and 25, at depths of 800 and 1,100 feet below the surface, respectively. See also certain maps and graphics of our property set forth under “Our Operations.”
HPG estimated the total of the Big Island Mine’s remaining leased and licensed proven and probable trona reserves as 220.0 million short tons and the total of the measured and indicated in-place trona resources inclusive of reserves as 162.3 million short tons 

as of December 31, 2021. The cutoff grade of greater than 75% trona and thickness greater than 6 feet is applied to estimate the trona resources based upon successful mining and processing of the lower grade trona Beds 19, 20 and 21 which were considered viable mining prospects by Texas Gulf Soda Ash (TGSA). The mineral resource inclusive of the mineral reserves is that portion of the ore body that is considered either economically viable for mining and can be converted to reserves or of economic interest but considered outside the current economic limits. This is the material considered of economic interest that has the potential to be converted to reserves. Our trona resources are categorized as “Measured mineral resources,” “Indicated mineral resources,” and “Inferred mineral resources,” which are defined as follows:
•Measured mineral resources - Mineral resources for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of conclusive geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with a measured mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply modifying factors, as defined in this section, in sufficient detail to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Because a measured mineral resource has a higher level of confidence than the level of confidence of either an indicated mineral resource or an inferred mineral resource, a measured mineral resource may be converted to a proven mineral reserve or to a probable mineral reserve.
• Indicated mineral resources - Mineral resources for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of adequate geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological certainty associated with an indicated mineral resource is sufficient to allow a qualified person to apply the modifying factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. Because an indicated mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than the level of confidence of a measured mineral resource, an indicated mineral resource may only be converted to a probable mineral reserve. (The modifying factors are the factors that a qualified person must apply to indicated and measured mineral resources and then evaluate in order to establish the economic viability of mineral reserves. A qualified person must apply and evaluate modifying factors to convert measured and indicated mineral resources to proven and probable mineral reserves. These factors include but are not restricted to mining; processing; metallurgical; infrastructure; economic; marketing; legal; environmental compliance; plans, negotiations, or agreements with local individuals or groups; and governmental factors. The number, type and specific characteristics of the modifying factors applied will necessarily be a function of and depend upon the mineral, mine, property, or project.)
•Inferred mineral resources - Mineral resources for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. The level of geological uncertainty associated with an inferred mineral resource is too high to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability. Because an inferred mineral resource has the lowest level of geological confidence of all mineral resources, which prevents the application of the modifying factors in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability, an inferred mineral resource may not be considered when assessing the economic viability of a mining project and may not be converted to a mineral reserve.

The Company has not previously disclosed estimates of measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources for periods prior to fiscal year 2021 for comparison.
HPG estimated proven and probable reserves of approximately 220.0 million short tons of trona, which is equivalent to 119.1 million short tons of soda ash as of December 31, 2021. Based on our current mining rate of approximately 4.0 million short tons of trona per year, we have enough proven and probable trona reserves to continue mining trona using current methods in excess of 50 years. For comparison, Sisecam Wyoming’s staff estimated proven and probable reserves of approximately 208.2 million short tons, which is equivalent to 113.4 million short tons of soda ash as of December 31, 2020. The increase of estimated proven and probable reserves of approximately 11.8 million short tons, or 5.7%, as of December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the updated staged LOM mine plan from 8-ft Isopach to 7-ft Isopach during the year ended December 31, 2021. (Isopach is a line drawn on a map connecting all points of equal thickness of a particular geologic formation.)
The mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted. Our trona reserves are categorized as “Proven mineral reserves” and “Probable mineral reserves,” which are defined as follows:
•Proven mineral reserves - The economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource and can only result from conversion of a measured mineral resource.
•Probable mineral reserves - The economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some cases, a measured mineral resource.
In determining the reserve parameters and assumptions HPG considered the following circumstances (actual results could differ from these assumptions): 
•Sisecam Wyoming’s 60 year long history and economics of mining the deposit and producing soda ash;
◦The 170.1 million short tons of trona ore produced from these two beds;
•The projected long life of the mine and resulting likely changes in economics, mining, and processing methods over the projected 40-year mine life used in this technical summary. This 40-year mine life consideration is based on the specific 

assumptions in this technical summary, including assumptions related to projected timing and estimated cost of two-seam mining, timing of related capital expenditures and sales price projections and estimates related to future availability of deca;
•Sisecam Wyoming’s current processing facilities’ capabilities and projected future changes to these facilities.
•The economics associated with Sisecam Wyoming’s current mining equipment and history of “high grading” the thickest portions of the deposit;
•Sisecam Wyoming’s current mining equipment limitations and required future changes to these systems; and
•HPG’s knowledge of operating and managing other trona and potash mines.
In determining the reserves, HPG made certain assumptions regarding the remaining life of the Big Island Mine, including, among other things, that:
•the cost of products sold per short ton will remain consistent with Sisecam Wyoming’s cost of products sold for the five years ended December 31, 2021;
•the weighted average net sales per short ton of $188/ton will remain consistent with Sisecam Wyoming’s average net sales for the five years ended December 31, 2021;
•Sisecam Wyoming’s mining costs will remain consistent with 2021 levels with two-seam mining costs 30% higher for the two-seam production (the Partnership estimates that this increase would not impact its overall production cost by more than 1% and thus would not have a material overall impact to the Partnership’s production costs);
•Sisecam Wyoming’s processing costs will remain consistent with 2021 levels and rise in 10-years to account for lower grade material;
•Sisecam Wyoming will achieve an annual mining rate of approximately 5.0 million short tons of trona in 2024 and beyond;
•Sisecam Wyoming will process soda ash with a 90% rate of recovery, without accounting for the deca rehydration process;
•the ore to ash ratio for the stated trona reserves is 1.835:1.0 (short tons of trona run-of-mine to short tons of soda ash);
•The run-of-mine ore estimate contains dilution from the mining process;
•Sisecam Wyoming will continue to conduct only conventional mining using the room and pillar method and a non-subsidence mine design;
•Sisecam Wyoming will, in approximately 10 years, make necessary modifications to the processing facilities to allow localized mining of 75% ore grade in areas where the floor seam or insoluble disruptions have moved up into the mining horizon causing mining to be halted early due to processing facility limitations;
•Sisecam Wyoming will, within one year, conduct two-seam mining, in production panels which means to perform continuous mining on Bed 24 beneath historically mined production panels of Bed 25 with interburden thickness of approximately 35-feet;
•Sisecam Wyoming will, in approximately 20 years, make necessary equipment modifications to operate at a seam height of 7-feet, the current mining limit is 9-feet;
•Sisecam Wyoming has and will continue to have valid leases and license in place with respect to the reserves, and that these leases and license can be renewed for the life of the mine based on their extensive history of renewing leases and license; 
•Sisecam Wyoming has and will continue to have the necessary permits to conduct mining operations with respect to the reserves; and 
•Sisecam Wyoming will maintain the necessary tailings storage capacity to maintain tailings disposal between the mine and surface placement for the life-of-mine. 
Our estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves will change from time to time as a result of mining activities, analysis of new engineering and geologic data, modification of mining plans or mining methods and other factors. For additional information, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Risks Inherent in our Business and Industry” for more information regarding risks surrounding our reserves.
Internal Controls Disclosure over Trona Resources and Trona Reserves

We have internal controls over the trona resources and trona reserves estimation processes that result in reasonable and reliable estimates aligned with industry practice and reporting regulations. Annually, qualified persons and other employees review the estimates of trona resources and trona reserves and the supporting documentation, and based on their review of such information recommend approval to use the trona resources and trona reserves estimates to our senior management. Our controls utilize management systems, including, but not limited to, standardized procedures, workflow processes, supervision and management approval, internal and external reviews and audits, reconciliations, and data security covering record keeping, chain of custody and data storage. Our systems also cover sample preparation and analysis, data verification, trona processing, metallurgical testing, recovery estimation, mine design and sequencing, and trona resource and reserve evaluations, with environmental, social and regulatory considerations.
These controls and other methods help to validate the reasonableness of the estimates. The effectiveness of the controls are reviewed periodically to address changes in conditions and the degree of compliance with policies and procedures. For additional information regarding the risks associated with our estimates of trona resources and reserves, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, “Risks Inherent in our Business and Industry-Our reserve and resource data are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and are based on existing economic and operating conditions that may change in the future, which could materially and adversely affect the quantities and value of our reserves and resources.” 
Competition
Soda ash is a commodity natural resource traded globally with numerous producers and consumers worldwide. We compete with both North American and international soda ash producers. There are two ways to consider how we compete: (1) versus our fellow North American competitors; and (2) versus our worldwide competitors. Against our principal North American competitors, which include subsidiaries of Genesis, Solvay and Tata in the Green River Basin and Searles Valley Minerals in California, we believe we have a number of competitive advantages, including operational advantages that improve our relative cost position, life of our mineral reserves, our strong safety record, customer relationships and an experienced management team and workforce. Against our principal worldwide competitors, Solvay and various Chinese producers virtually all of their production is manufactured from synthetic processes and we believe, as a producer of soda ash from trona, we have competitive advantages when compared to synthetic producers, even after considering the fact that we generally have higher logistics costs to move the soda ash from Wyoming to regions around the world. The costs associated with procuring the materials needed for synthetic production are greater than the costs associated with mining trona. In addition, trona-based production consumes less energy and produces fewer undesirable by-products than synthetic production. See “Our Competitive Strengths” above for additional information.
Insurance
Because all of our operations are conducted at a single facility, an event such as an explosion, fire, equipment malfunction or severe weather conditions could significantly disrupt our trona mining or soda ash production operations and our ability to supply soda ash to our customers. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of our surface and subsurface operations. To mitigate this risk, our Sponsors and/or their affiliates maintain, on our behalf, property, casualty and business interruption insurance in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are adequate for our current operations. We regularly evaluate our policy limits and deductibles as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our insurance coverage to account for changes or growth in our business.
Environmental Matters
Our mining and processing operations, which have been conducted at our Green River Basin facility since 1962, are subject to strict regulation by federal, state, and local authorities with respect to protection of the environment. We have a rigorous compliance program to ensure that our facilities comply with environmental laws and regulations. However, we are involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters. Modifications or changes in enforcement of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations in the future, particularly with respect to environmental or climate change, or changes in the operation of our business or the discovery of additional or unknown environmental contamination, could require expenditures that might be material to our results of operations or financial condition.
We summarize below certain environmental laws applicable to us that regulate discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites, the protection of groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, and climate change. Our failure to comply with any of the below laws may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of clean-up and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations.
Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (“WDEQ”)
Our operations are subject to oversight by the Land Quality Division of Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (“WDEQ”). Our principal mine permit issued by the Land Quality Division, requires the Partnership to provide financial assurances for our reclamation obligations for the estimated future cost to reclaim the area of our processing facility, surface pond complex and 

on-site sanitary landfill. The Partnership provides such assurances through a third-party surety bond (the “Surety Bond”). According to the annual recalculation and submittal, the Surety Bond amount was $41.8 million and $36.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amount of such assurances that we are required to provide is subject to change upon annual recalculation according to Department of Environmental Quality’s Guideline 12, annual site inspection and subsequent evaluation/approval by the WDEQ’s Land Quality Division. 
Clean Air Act
The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources. Under the Clean Air Act, our facility has been issued a Title V operating permit, which regulates emissions to air from our operations. In particular, our operations are subject to technology-based standards pursuant to the Clean Air Act’s New Source Performance Standards for Nonmetallic Mineral Processing Plants, which limit particulate matter emissions. Under associated Clean Air Act regulations our operation is also subject to Best Available Control Technology (“BACT”) requirements. In addition, our boilers are subject to technology-based standards pursuant to the Clean Air Act’s National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Major Source: Industrial, Commercial and Institutional Boilers and Process Heaters, which were published in final form in November 2015. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants.
Clean Water Act
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which we refer to as the Clean Water Act, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or the state. We do not discharge any wastewater from our operations into the Green River, the nearest river system to our Green River Basin facility. However, the discharge of storm water runoff from our facility is governed by a general permit issued by the WDEQ. In particular, the general permit requires our compliance with a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. We periodically monitor groundwater wells at our processing facility, most of which are proximate to our surface pond complex, for salinity, conductivity and other parameters pursuant to permits issued by the WDEQ. Permitted interceptor trenches are used to collect saline groundwater to minimize impact to the Green River.
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and analogous state laws, impose requirements for the careful generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes. Based on the amount of hazardous waste our operations generate (less than 100 kilograms per month), we have been classified under RCRA as a conditionally exempt small quantity generator. 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) (otherwise known as “Superfund”), and comparable state laws impose liability in connection with the release of hazardous substances into the environment. CERCLA imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and those who disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Wyoming’s Environmental Quality Act also creates the potential for liability in connection with the release of hazardous substances into the environment and has been construed to impose liability without regard to fault. We have not received notice that we are a potentially responsible party at any Superfund site.
Climate Change Legislation and Regulations
In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, or GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources, including soda ash processors like us. We are monitoring and reporting GHG emissions from our operations, and we believe we are in compliance with the rules. In the past, the U.S. Congress has considered, but not enacted, legislation that would impose requirements to reduce emissions of GHGs. The State of California has enacted regulations establishing a so-called GHG “cap-and-trade” system designed to reduce GHG emissions. Our operations are not currently subject to any federal or state requirement to reduce GHG emissions. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations limiting, or otherwise imposing a tax or financial penalty for, emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations might be material to our results of operations or financial condition.
Mining and Workplace Safety 
We believe our commitment to safety and reliability is an integral component to our fulfillment of our corporate responsibility and long term success. Through rigorous training, sharing of expertise within the Partnership, continuous monitoring and promoting a culture of excellence in operations, we continuously strive to keep our workforce, the communities in which we operate and the environment safe.
Our focus on safety is also evident in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 and all governmental actions in response thereto on all aspects of our business, including how it impacts our employees. We have taken strong proactive steps to keep the safety of our teams and their families as the priority. We have been executing and continue to execute on a comprehensive plan to help prevent the spread of the virus in our work locations, and it appears to be having a positive impact. This plan includes multiple layers of protection for our employees, including but not limited to, social distancing, working from home for certain employees, increased sanitation, restricted contractor and visitor access, temperature checks on employees, all contractors and third-party vendors, travel restrictions, mask wearing requirements, and daily communication with our teams. We have conducted proactive quarantining and contact tracing from the early days of this pandemic and require self-reporting of any illness, and other measures in keeping with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and best practices. We have also prepared strong contingency plans for all our operations with specific actions based on absentee rates. While we have not utilized any such plans to date as they have not been needed, they are continuously refined in case needed. We have encouraged employees to consider getting vaccinated. We anticipate a re-opening of society when the virus plateaus and diminishes, and we have completed re-entry plans to implement as they become appropriate. We are using data to guide our actions rather than firm dates, and our teams are kept up to date on these plans. Our focus prior to and during this pandemic has been the safety of our teams and this will continue to be our priority as we scale our operations back to normal as the data guides us to do so. We continue to actively monitor and adhere to applicable local, state, federal, and international governmental guidelines and actions to better ensure the safety of our employees.
MSHA is the primary regulatory organization governing safety matters associated with trona ore mining. Accordingly, MSHA regulates underground mines and the industrial mineral processing facilities associated with trona ore mines. MSHA administers the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and enforces compliance with that statute’s mandatory safety and health standards. As part of MSHA’s oversight, representatives perform at least four unannounced inspections annually for our entire facility, as well as spot check every five days in our underground facility due to our Green River Basin facility being classified as a gassy mine. For 2021, we averaged 0.55 citations per inspection day, which is below the industry average of 1.06 citations per inspection day.
We also are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public. 
Our Green River Basin facility maintains a rigorous safety program. Sisecam Chemicals and its affiliates’ employees and contractors who operate our assets are required to complete 40 hours of initial training, as well as eight-hour annual refresher sessions. These training programs cover all of the potential site-specific hazards present at the facility. As a direct result of our commitment to safety, the Green River Basin facility has had an exceptional safety record in recent years. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our facility had one lost workday injury and three recordable injuries as reported by MSHA. During the five years ended December 31, 2021, our Green River Basin facility averaged 0.8 lost workday injuries per year and averaged 4.2 recordable injuries per year as reported by MSHA.
Human Capital
The success of our company is a direct result of our people, our values, and our culture. We believe in the potential of each individual, and we grow our potential into results through training and development.
Employees/Labor Relations
The personnel who operate our assets are employees of Sisecam Chemicals and its affiliates; and the Partnership does not have any employees. Under the joint venture agreement governing Sisecam Wyoming, Sisecam Wyoming reimburses us for the time and cost of employees who operate our assets and for support provided to Sisecam Wyoming. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Sisecam Chemicals and its U.S. affiliates had approximately 499 and 489 full-time employees, of which 448 and 444 are employees who operate the mine at our facility in the Green River Basin, respectively.

Employee Development and Training
Our learning, training, and development strategy is founded upon the pillars of safety, leadership, and skills development. Each of these pillars has its own objectives, strategy, and measurements for success.
•Safety: “Safety is a value, not just a priority. It’s how we do business, it’s who we are.” We believe this, we live it, and our culture of safety training is founded on it. Every new employee participates in safety training that is specific to their work environment. Wyoming employees also participate in annual safety refresher training. Training is the vehicle we use to align our safety expectations and practices with our vision for a Zero Incident Mindset. 
•Leadership: Our leaders play a critical role in building our culture. Our commitment to employee development raises employee engagement, buy-in and advances our performance. Leadership is not an assignment, a job, or a title. Leadership is a choice and we equip our leaders with tools and skills to effectively lead our employees and grow our business. These skills and tools are taught and practiced in a series of formal leadership courses that address the unique needs and challenges of our business. 
•Skills Development: Skills development has 3 subcategories: 
• Career Progression 
• Maintenance Apprenticeships 
• Education Assistance
Safety
We pride ourselves on our safety record, and we are continually one of the leaders in the U.S. mining industry in relation to low incident rates and workplace injuries. We maintain a rigorous safety program, which includes training, site audits and hazard identification. Sisecam Chemicals and its affiliates, our employees and all contractors who operate our assets or work at our facility are involved in our safety programs. As a direct result of this commitment, we have achieved many recognitions such as the Sentinels of Safety by the National Mining Association, The Industrial Minerals Association-North America Safety Achievement Award (Large Category) five times, most recently in September of 2021 at the Fall Industrial Minerals Association-North America Conference, Safe Sam Award by the Wyoming Mining Association two times, most recently June 2021, and the Wyoming State Mine Inspector’s Large Mine award multiple times. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our facility had one lost work day injury and three recordable injuries as reported by MSHA. We also boast and support some of the best rescue teams in the country. In 2021, our Mine Rescue team competed in the Southwest Wyoming Mutual Aid competition. With 15 teams in attendance, Sisecam’s Mine Rescue team made a clean sweep of the competition including, overall champion, while also placing first in the field, team tech, bench and first aid competition. There were, however, no surface rescue contests or national mine rescue contests in 2021 due to COVID-19.
