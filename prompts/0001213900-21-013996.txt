Sales and Marketing Update
 
Our sales team continues to expand our business with existing and new clients communicating the increased value of our enterprise platform approach.  We are focused on increasing the depth and breadth of our business across existing client product portfolios by maximizing the utilization of our network.  We are expanding our business by providing new solutions and obtaining new clients. Our team is also working on converting current clients from individual solutions to enterprise platform deals with access to our full set of solutions across our network. These enterprise deals enable us to increase our revenue per customer, and give us a more predictable and consistent revenue stream. 
 
While our expenditures were down in 2020 due to the global pandemic, we have continued to ramp up our marketing efforts by focusing more heavily on strategic content with thought leadership in the media and at events, as well as tailoring our solution marketing with an account-based approach. Our efforts are focused on cementing our image as a strategic partner with our buyers, so we have expanded our panel of thought leadership voices to include more of our leadership team. They are actively participating as speakers and panelists at industry events, and we have significantly increased our footprint within earned industry media. Additionally, we hosted a series of webinars featuring industry leaders in 2020 to foster collaboration, and we introduced the first annual Innovate4Outcomes event, bringing together thought leaders from across the healthcare industry to collaborate on solutions to some of the toughest challenges facing life sciences and providers.

We expanded our attendance and participation at investor conferences in 2020, most on a virtual basis. We have built marketing strategy momentum in 2020 with increased industry visibility that we expect to expand in 2021.
 
Operational Update
 
In 2020, we continued to expand our existing network and physician utilization of our partner networks. We continue to work individually with our partners to improve point-of-care workflow, increase overall revenue derived from each channel and increase coupon utilization by providers who have access. We are also focused on increasing the number of physicians who have access to our service offerings. In addition to revenue growth provided by new pharma brands and network partners, we believe there is significant revenue growth potential within existing brands by better utilizing our existing partner networks and expanding our available solutions.
 
We also signed agreements with partners that give us access to provide messages directly to consumers.
 
Technology Update
 
To support our growth and to further improve the efficiency of our systems, we have moved our core platforms to Amazon Web Services. As a result of our acquisitions in 2018 and 2019, we now have tech teams based in both Croatia and Israel, in addition to our core team in the U.S., to help develop further applications throughout the organization.
Principal Solutions and Applications
 
Our principal solutions and applications can be summarized as follows:
 

● | Financial Messaging – Our integrated financial messaging platform is a revolutionary virtual “Patient Support Center” that allows doctors and staff to access a universe of sample vouchers, co-pay coupons and other patient support options through their EMR and/or e-Prescribe systems. It allows them to search, print or electronically dispense directly to patients and a national network of pharmacies. Our platform eliminates the need for physicians to manage and store physical drug samples by offering a more convenient and efficient way to allocate, administer and track samples and co-pay savings for their patients. Today, nearly 60% of doctor offices ban or limit drug representatives and the samples they offer. While samples are still valuable, our solution addresses the fact that many healthcare systems and doctors are looking for an easier, more effective way to increase affordable access and adherence to their prescribed branded medications.

● | Brand and Therapeutic Support Messaging – Our brand messaging services include a variety of brand awareness and therapeutic support messaging services that can be tailored to meet the needs of a brand. These messages can include brand awareness messages, reminder ads, therapeutic support messages and unbranded messages that can be targeted by specialty, diagnostic code and other criteria. Brand messaging is highly complementary to our core financial messaging solution. Historically, we have sold brand messaging based on specific solutions offered by our Electronic Health Record (“EHR”) partners, but we have developed our own proprietary banner messaging system, rolled this solution out in 2017, and expanded it since then. We also developed our own therapeutic support messaging system and launched it with our first partner in late 2018. We believe brand messaging represents a significant growth opportunity for us.

● | Brand Support – Our brand support is focused on educating and working with pharmaceutical manufacturers on identifying, formulating, and implementing new eRx media strategies for promoting their solutions. Our services include: 1) Drug File Integration - a service designed to better insure that manufacturers’ drugs are present in every ePrescribing platform available; 2) Sales Force Training – a service to educate the extended field sales force on this new integrated solution and what to look for within their client base to insure maximum exposure of their brands; and 3) Strategy Development – a service that assists pharmaceutical manufacturers in identifying and building a competitive strategy to take advantage of this new digital frontier. Currently, this activity results in less than 10% of our revenue, but represents a significant growth opportunity for us.

● | Patient Engagement – Our patient engagement activities arose out of our acquisition of CareSpeak Communications in October 2018, followed by our acquisition of RMDY Health in 2019. Our technology solution provides digital messaging services through our cloud based Mobile Health Messenger (“MHM”) Platform. We provide interactive health messaging for improved medication adherence and care coordination. Our HIPAA-compliant, automated, mobile messaging platform allows pharmaceutical manufactures and related entities to directly engage with patients to improve regimen compliance. We also deliver patient programs with treatment and affordability information, lifestyle and condition trackers, Internet device connectivity, forms and surveys, with this all supported by a wide range of communication capabilities delivered via chat, bots, audio and telehealth. We enable this functionality for our customers, with our solutions delivering a variety of intervention mechanisms that help treat chronic conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease.

Competition
 
Our core platform competes in the highly competitive pharmaceutical and life sciences digital marketing industry that is dominated by large well-known companies with established names, solid market niches, wide arrays of product offerings and marketing networks. Our messaging offerings compete for pharmaceutical budgets with a variety of other forms of advertising and promotion.
 
We have a growing list of potential partners whom either have content that they want to deliver through our distribution engine and network, or have complementary technology and want to integrate our solution as a channel partner and thereby increase their reach to clinicians. The primary direct competitor in our space of the market is ConnectiveRx. However, we believe our breadth of brands offered, extensive list of pharmaceutical clients, and the vast reach of our network give us a substantial advantage and allow us to achieve a dominant position in the marketplace.
 
Intellectual Property
 
In 2012, we were awarded a patent for our innovative solution (US Patent No. 8,341,015). This award was a result of our extensive research and development efforts. The awarded claims cover our ability to electronically process, display and distribute eligible prescription savings on the medications and therapies healthcare providers wish to prescribe for their patients. As part of our acquisition of CareSpeak Communications, we also acquired (US Patent No. 7,956,727) related to methods and systems for medication management. We also have other patent applications submitted in various stages of review.
 
We use a nationally ranked intellectual property law firm to further expand and protect our intellectual property. We believe our current and expanding IP will allow us to continue being the leader in this rapidly growing space. We stand ready to prepare additional filings, as necessary, to protect our intellectual property on any forthcoming solutions that will further assist and support physicians, pharmacists and patients.
 
OPTIMIZERx, CareSpeak, RMDY Wellness Layers, Diet Watch, and SampleMD are our licensed trademarks.

Government Regulation
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Anti-Kickback Statutes
 
The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals or otherwise generate business involving goods or services reimbursed in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, the statute has been violated. The law contains a few statutory exceptions, including payments to bona fide employees, certain discounts and certain payments to group purchasing organizations. Violations can result in significant penalties, imprisonment and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal healthcare program from paying for its products. In addition, kickback arrangements can provide the basis for an action under the Federal False Claims Act, which is discussed in more detail below. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and potentially prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, the Office of Inspector General of Health and Human Services, or OIG, issued a series of regulations, known as the safe harbors, beginning in July 1991. These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all the applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. Arrangements that implicate the Anti-Kickback Law, and that do not fall within a safe harbor, are analyzed by the OIG on a case-by-case basis. Government officials have focused recent enforcement efforts on, among other things, the sales and marketing activities of healthcare companies, and recently have brought cases against individuals or entities with personnel who allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business. Settlements of these cases by healthcare companies have involved significant fines and/or penalties and in some instances criminal pleas. In addition to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, many states have their own kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply with respect to all payors, including commercial health insurance companies.
False Claims Laws
 
Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Manufacturers can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, if they are found to have caused submission of false claims. The Federal Civil False Claims Act also includes whistle blower provisions that allow private citizens to bring suit against an entity or individual on behalf of the United States and to recover a portion of any monetary recovery. Many of the recent highly publicized settlements in the healthcare industry related to sales and marketing practices have been cases brought under the False Claims Act. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer’s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.

Privacy and Security
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the rules promulgated there under require certain entities, referred to as covered entities, to comply with established standards, including standards regarding the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. HIPAA further requires that covered entities enter into agreements meeting certain regulatory requirements with their business associates, as such term is defined by HIPAA, which, among other things, obligate the business associates to safeguard the covered entity’s PHI against improper use and disclosure. While not directly regulated by HIPAA, our customers or distributors might face significant contractual liability pursuant to such an agreement if the business associate breaches the agreement or causes the covered entity to fail to comply with HIPAA.  It is possible that HIPPA compliance could become a substantial regulatory burden and expense to our operations, although we do not believe that this will occur as a general website publisher.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 57 full-time employees in the U.S, as well as 14 full-time international employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to their employment with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Subsidiaries
 
We conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, OptimizeRx Corporation, a Michigan corporation, CareSpeak Communications, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, CareSpeak Communications, D.O.O, a controlled foreign corporation incorporated in Croatia, RMDY Health, Inc. a Delaware corporation, and Cyberdiet, a controlled foreign corporation incorporated in Israel.
 
Recent developments
 
In March 2021, our Board of Directors amended the 2013 Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares authorized under the Plan to 6,000.000 shares.
