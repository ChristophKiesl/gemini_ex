ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

OVERVIEW
 Our History
 We were formed as a Delaware limited partnership in April 2004 and, since our formation, our general partner has been StoneMor GP, a Delaware limited liability company. From May 2014 until December 31, 2019, the sole member of StoneMor GP was GP Holdings.
Recent Developments
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China (“COVID-19”) and has since spread worldwide, including to the Unites States (the “U.S.”), posing public health risks that have reached pandemic proportions (the “COVID-19 Pandemic”). The COVID-19 Pandemic poses a threat to the health and economic wellbeing of our employees, customers and vendors. Currently, our operations have been deemed essential by the state and local governments in which we operate, with the exception of Puerto Rico, and we are actively working with federal, state and local government officials to ensure that we continue to satisfy their requirements for offering our essential services. The operation of all of our facilities is critically dependent on our employees who staff these locations. To ensure the wellbeing of our employees and their families, we have provided all of our employees with detailed health and safety literature on COVID-19, such as the Center for Disease Control (the “CDC”)’s industry-specific guidelines for working with the deceased who were and may have been infected with COVID-19. In addition, our procurement and safety teams have updated and developed new safety-oriented guidelines to support daily field operations and provided personal protection equipment to those employees whose positions necessitate them, and we have implemented work from home policies at our corporate office consistent with CDC guidance to reduce the risks of exposure to COVID-19 while still supporting the families that we serve. 
 Our marketing and sales team has quickly responded to the sales challenges presented by the COVID-19 Pandemic by implementing virtual meeting options using a variety of web-based tools to ensure that we can continue to connect with and meet our customers’ needs in a safe, effective and productive manner. Some of our locations have also started providing live video streaming of their funeral and burial services to our customers, so that family and friends can connect virtually during their time of grief. 
 Like most businesses world-wide, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted us financially; however, we cannot presently predict the scope and severity with which COVID-19 will impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As recently as early March 2020, we were experiencing sales growth for the first quarter of 2020, as compared to the first quarter of 2019. However, over the last two weeks, we have seen our pre-need sales activity decline as Americans practice social distancing. In addition, our pre-need customers with installment contracts could default on their installment contracts due to lost work or other financial stresses arising from the COVID-19 Pandemic. While we expect our pre-need sales to be challenged during the COVID 19 Pandemic, we believe the implementation of our virtual meeting tools is one of several key steps to mitigate this disruption. In addition, we expect that throughout this disruption our cemeteries and funeral homes will remain open and available to serve our families in all the locations in which we operate to the extent permitted by local authorities, with the exception of Puerto Rico.
 C-Corporation Conversion
 On December 31, 2019, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we completed the following series of reorganization transactions (which we sometimes refer to collectively as the “C-Corporation Conversion”):
  
• | GP Holdings contributed its entire equity interest in the Partnership to StoneMor GP and, in exchange, ultimately received an aggregate of 5,099,969 shares of our common stock;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | StoneMor GP contributed the common units in the Partnership it received from GP Holdings to LP Sub, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of StoneMor GP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5


 
• | Merger Sub merged with and into the Partnership, with the Partnership surviving as a Delaware limited partnership, and pursuant to which each outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Unit (defined below) and Common Unit (other than the common units held by LP Sub) was converted into the right to receive one share of our common stock; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | StoneMor GP converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation called StoneMor Inc.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result of the C-Corporation Conversion, the Company remains the general partner of the Partnership and LP Sub is the sole limited partner of the Partnership such that, directly or indirectly, the Company owns 100% of the interests in the Partnership.
 Divestitures and Early Debt Redemptions
 On January 3, 2020, we sold substantially all of the assets of Oakmont Memorial Park, Oakmont Funeral Home, Redwood Chapel, Inspiration Chapel and Oakmont Crematory located in California pursuant to the terms of an asset sale agreement (the “Oakmont Agreement”) with Carriage Funeral Holdings, Inc. for an aggregate cash purchase price of $33.0 million (the “Oakmont Sale”). The divested assets consisted of one cemetery, one funeral home and certain related assets. In March 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement for the sale of substantially all of the assets of the cemetery, funeral establishment and crematory commonly known as Olivet Memorial Park, Olivet Funeral and Cremation Services, and Olivet Memorial Park & Crematory pursuant to the terms of an asset sale agreement (the “Olivet Agreement”) with Cypress Lawn Cemetery Association for a net cash purchase price of $24.3 million, subject to certain adjustments (the “Olivet Sale”). In addition, in March 2020, we entered into an asset sale agreement (the “California Agreement”) with certain entities owned by John Yeatman and Guy Saxton to sell substantially all of our remaining California properties, consisting of five cemeteries, six funeral establishments and four crematories (the “Remaining California Assets”) for a cash purchase price of $7.1 million, subject to certain closing adjustments (the “Remaining California Sale”).
 In January 2020, we redeemed an aggregate $30.4 million of principal of our 9.875%/11.500% Senior Secured PIK Toggle Notes due 2024 (the “Senior Secured Notes”), primarily using the net proceeds from the Oakmont Sale. Per the indenture dated June 27, 2019 by and among the Partnership, Cornerstone Family Services of West Virginia Subsidiary, Inc., certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, the initial purchasers party thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and as collateral agent (as amended, the “Indenture”), we anticipate using the first $23.7 million of net proceeds and 80% of the remaining net proceeds from the Olivet Sale along with 80% of the net proceeds from the Remaining California Sale to redeem additional portions of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes. 
 The information set forth in this Annual Report regarding our cemeteries and funeral homes is as of December 31, 2019 and does not give effect to the Oakmont Sale, the Olivet Sale or the Remaining California Sale.
 Amendments to the Indenture and Capital Raise in 2020
 On April 1, 2020, the Partnership, Cornerstone Family Services of West Virginia Subsidiary, Inc. (collectively with the Partnership, the “Issuers”) and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, entered into the Third Supplemental Indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture”) to the Indenture. Pursuant to the terms of the Supplemental Indenture:
  
1. | The following financial covenants were amended:
---+------------------------------------------------


a. | The Interest Coverage Ratio measurements at March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2020 were eliminated and replaced with a Minimum Operating Cash Flow covenant of $(25.0 million), $(35.0 million) and $(35.0 million), respectively;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | The required Interest Coverage Ratios at December 31, 2020, March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 were reduced to 0.00x, 0.75x and 1.10x, respectively, from 1.15x, 1.25x and 1.30x; and
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | The Asset Coverage tests at March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2020 were reduced to 1.40x from 1.60x;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The premium payable upon voluntary redemption of the Senior Secured Notes on or after June 27, 2021 and before June 27, 2022 was increased from 4.0% to 5.0% and the premium payable upon any such voluntary redemption on or after June 27, 2022 and before June 27, 2023 was increased from 2.0% to 3.0%; and
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The Issuers agreed to use their best efforts to cause us to effectuate a rights offering on the terms described below as promptly as practicable with an expiration date no later than July 24, 2020 and to receive proceeds of not less than $8.2 million therefrom (in addition to the $8.8 million capital raise described below).
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6


The foregoing amendments effected by the Supplemental Indenture will become operational when we pay a $5 million consent fee to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, of which $3.5 million will be paid in cash and $1.5 million will be paid by increasing the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding, and satisfy other specified conditions. 
 Concurrently with the execution of the Supplemental Indenture, we entered into a letter agreement (the “Axar Commitment”) with Axar pursuant to which Axar committed to (a) purchase shares of our Series A Preferred Stock with an aggregate purchase price of $8.8 million on April 3, 2020, (b) exercise its basic rights in the rights offering by tendering the shares of Series A Preferred Stock so purchased for shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share (“Common Stock”) and (c) purchase any shares offered in the rights offering for which other stockholders do not exercise their rights, up to a maximum of an additional $8.2 million of such shares. We did not pay Axar any commitment, backstop or other fees in connection with the Axar Commitment.
 On April 3, 2020, as contemplated by the Axar Commitment, the Company and Axar CL SPV LLC, Star V Partners LLC and Blackwell Partners LLC –Series E. (the “2020 Purchasers”) entered into a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “2020 Preferred Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which we sold 176 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Preferred Shares”), for a cash price of $50,000 per share, an aggregate of $8.8 million.  We offered and sold the Preferred Shares in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) thereof. We relied on this exemption from registration based in part on representations made by the 2020 Purchasers in the 2020 Preferred Purchase Agreement.
 Under the terms of the Supplemental Indenture and the Axar Commitment, we agreed to undertake an offering to holders of our Common Stock of transferable rights to purchase their pro rata share of shares of Common Stock with an aggregate exercise price of at least $17 million at a price of $0.73 per share. The rights offering period, during which the rights will be transferable, will be no less than 20 calendar days and no more than 45 calendar days.  We agreed to use our best efforts to complete the rights offering with an expiration date no later than July 24, 2020.
 Recapitalization Transactions in 2019
 On June 27, 2019, we closed a $447.5 million recapitalization transaction, consisting of (i) the sale of an aggregate of 52,083,333 of the Partnership’s Series A Preferred Units (the “Series A Convertible Preferred Units”) representing limited partner interests in the Partnership at a purchase price of $1.1040 per Preferred Unit, reflecting an 8% discount to the liquidation preference of each Preferred Unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $57.5 million (the “Preferred Offering”) and (ii) a concurrent private placement of $385.0 million of Senior Secured Notes to certain financial institutions (collectively with the Preferred Offering, the “Recapitalization Transactions”). The net proceeds of the Recapitalization Transactions were used to fully repay our then-outstanding senior notes due in June 2021 and retire the revolving credit facility due in May 2020, as well as for associated transaction expenses, cash collateralization of existing letters of credit and other needs under the former credit facility, with the balance available for general corporate purposes.
Board Reconstitution
 In connection with the closing of the Recapitalization Transactions, our Board of Directors was reconstituted. Directors Martin R. Lautman, Ph.D., Leo J. Pound, Robert A Sick and Fenton R. Talbott resigned as directors and the authorized number of directors was reduced to seven. Andrew Axelrod, David Miller and Spencer Goldenberg were elected to fill the vacancies created by the resignations. The reconstituted board is comprised of Messrs. Axelrod, Miller and Goldenberg, Robert B. Hellman, Jr., Stephen Negrotti, Patricia Wellenbach and Joseph M. Redling. Mr. Axelrod serves as the chairman of the board. 
Strategic Partnership Agreement
 On April 2, 2020, we entered into two multi-year Master Services Agreements (the “MSAs”) with Moon Landscaping, Inc. and its affiliate, Rickert Landscaping, Inc. (collectively “Moon”). Under the terms of the MSAs, Moon will provide all grounds and maintenance services at most of the funeral homes, cemeteries and other properties we own or manage including, but not limited to, landscaping, openings and closings, burials, installations, routine maintenance and janitorial services. Moon will hire all of our grounds and maintenance employees at the serviced locations and will perform all functions currently handled by those employees. We expect the implementation of the MSAs to take place on a clustered basis over the next three to four months, with full implementation expected no later than July 31, 2020. 
 We agreed to pay a total of approximately $241 million over the term of the contract, which runs through December 31, 2024, based upon an initial annual cost of $49 million and annual increases of 2%. The first year cost will be prorated based upon exact implementation and roll-out schedule for each location. As part of the MSAs, we agreed to lease our landscaping and maintenance equipment to Moon for the duration of the agreements and to transfer title to any such equipment we own at the 
 7


end of the term to Moon, in each case without any additional payment by Moon. As of December 31, 2019, the net book value of the equipment we will be leasing to Moon was approximately $7.4 million.
 Each party has the right to terminate the MSAs at any time on six months’ prior written notice, provided that if we terminate the MSAs without cause, we will be obligated to pay Moon an equipment credit fee in the amount of $1.0 million for each year remaining in the term, prorated for the portion of the year in which any such termination occurs. The MSAs also contain representations, covenants and indemnity provisions that are customary for agreements of this nature.
 Products and Service Offerings
 We are currently one of the largest owners and operators of cemeteries and funeral homes in the U.S. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 321 cemeteries in 27 states and Puerto Rico. We own 291 of these cemeteries and we manage or operate the remaining 30 under lease, management or operating agreements with the nonprofit cemetery companies that own the cemeteries. As of December 31, 2019, we also owned, operated or managed 90 funeral homes, including 42 located on the grounds of cemetery properties that we own, in 17 states and Puerto Rico.
 The cemetery products and services that we sell include the following:
  
Interment Rights | Merchandise | Services 
----------------------+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------
burial lots | burial vaults | installation of burial vaults 
lawn crypts | caskets | installation of caskets 
mausoleum crypts | grave markers and grave marker bases | installation of other cemetery merchandise
cremation niches | memorials | other service items 
perpetual care rights | | 

 We sell these products and services both at the time of death, which we refer to as at-need, and prior to the time of death, which we refer to as pre-need. In 2019, we performed 52,010 burials and sold 25,963 interment rights (net of cancellations). Based on our sales of interment spaces in 2019, our cemeteries have an aggregate average remaining sales life of 243 years.
 Our cemetery properties are located in Alabama, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Our cemetery operations accounted for approximately 82% and 83% of our revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 The funeral home products and services that we sell include the following:
  
Merchandise | Services 
--------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------
caskets and related items | family consultation 
 | removal and preparation of remains 
 | insurance products 
 | use of funeral home facilities for visitation and prayer services

 
Our funeral homes are located in Alabama, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. Our funeral home operations accounted for approximately 18% and 17% of our consolidated revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
 OPERATIONS
 Segment Reporting and Related Information
 We have two distinct reportable segments, which are classified as Cemetery Operations and Funeral Home Operations segments, both of which are supported by corporate costs and expenses.
 We have chosen this level of organization and disaggregation of reportable segments because: (a) each reportable segment has unique characteristics that set it apart from the other segment; (b) we have organized our management personnel at these two operational levels; and (c) it is the level at which our chief decision makers evaluates performance.

Cemetery Operations
 As of December 31, 2019, we operated 321 cemeteries. Our Cemetery Operations include sales of cemetery interment rights, merchandise and services and the performance of cemetery maintenance and other services. An interment right entitles a customer to a burial space in one of our cemeteries and the perpetual care of that burial space. Burial spaces, or lots, are parcels of property that hold interred human remains. A burial vault is a rectangular container, usually made of concrete but can also be made of steel or plastic, which sits in the burial lot and in which the casket is placed. The top of the burial vault is buried approximately 18 to 24 inches below the surface of the ground, and the casket is placed inside the vault. Burial vaults prevent ground settling that may create uneven ground surfaces. Ground settling typically results in higher maintenance costs and potential exposure for accidents on the property. Lawn crypts are a series of closely spaced burial lots with preinstalled vaults and may include other improvements, such as landscaping, sprinkler systems and drainage. A mausoleum crypt is an above ground structure that may be designed for a particular customer, which we refer to as a private mausoleum or it may be a larger building that serves multiple customers, which we refer to as a community mausoleum. Cremation niches are spaces in which the ashes remaining after cremation are stored. Cremation niches are often part of community mausoleums; although we sell a variety of cremation niches to accommodate our customers’ preferences.
 Grave markers, monuments and memorials are above ground products that serve as memorials by showing who is remembered, the dates of birth and death and other pertinent information. These markers, monuments and memorials include simple plates, such as those used in a community mausoleum or cremation niche, flush-to-the-ground granite or bronze markers, headstones or large stone obelisks.
 One of the principal services we provide at our cemeteries is an "opening and closing," which is the digging and refilling of burial spaces to install the vault and place the casket into the vault. With pre-need sales, there are usually two openings and closings, where permitted by applicable law. During the initial opening and closing, we install the burial vault in the burial space. Where permitted by applicable law, we usually perform this service shortly after the customer signs a pre-need contract. Advance installation allows us to withdraw the related funds from our merchandise trusts, making the amount in excess of our cost to purchase and install the vault available to us for other uses and eliminates future merchandise trusting requirements for the burial vault and its installation. During the final opening and closing, we remove the dirt above the vault, open the lid of the vault, place the casket into the vault, close the vault lid and replace the ground cover. With at-need sales, we typically perform the initial opening and closing at the time we perform the final opening and closing. Our other services include the installation of other cemetery merchandise and the perpetual care related to interment rights.
 Funeral Home Operations
 As of December 31, 2019, we owned, operated or managed 90 funeral homes, 42 of which are located on the grounds of cemetery properties that we own. Our funeral homes offer a range of services to meet a family’s funeral needs, including family consultation, final expense insurance products, the removal and preparation of remains, provision of caskets and related funeral merchandise, the use of funeral home facilities for visitation, worship and performance of funeral services and transportation services. Funeral Home Operations primarily generate revenues from at-need sales.
Cremation Products and Services
 We operate crematories at some of our cemeteries or funeral homes, but our primary crematory operations are sales of receptacles for cremated remains, such as urns, and the inurnment of cremated remains in niches or scattering gardens. Cremation products and services usually cost less than traditional burial products and services and take up less space than burials. We sell cremation products and services on both a pre-need and an at-need basis.
Seasonality
 Although the death care business is relatively stable and predictable, our results of operations may be subject to seasonal fluctuations in deaths due to weather conditions, illness and public health crises, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic. Generally, more deaths occur during the winter months, primarily resulting from pneumonia and influenza. In addition, we generally perform fewer initial openings and closings in the winter, as the ground is frozen in many of the areas in which we operate. We may also experience declines in contracts written during the winter months due to increased inclement weather during which our sales staff would be unable to meet with customers.
Sales Contracts
 Pre-need products and services are typically sold on an installment basis. At-need products and services are generally required to be paid for in full in cash by the customer at the time of sale. As a result of our pre-need sales, the backlog of unfulfilled pre-
 9


need performance obligations recorded in deferred revenues was $949.4 million and $919.6 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 Trusts
 Sales of cemetery products and services are subject to a variety of state regulations. In accordance with these regulations, we are required to establish and fund two types of trusts: merchandise trusts and perpetual care trusts, to ensure that we can meet our future obligations. Our funding obligations are generally equal to a percentage of the sales proceeds or costs of the products and services we sell.
Sales Personnel, Training and Marketing
 As of December 31, 2019, we employed 455 full-time commissioned salespeople and four part-time commissioned salespeople, 125 salaried sales managers, 20 outside sales counselors and seven full-time sales support employees. We had two divisional sales vice presidents who report directly to our two divisional presidents. Individual salespersons are typically located at the cemeteries they serve and report directly to the cemetery sales manager. We have made a commitment to the ongoing education and training of our sales force and to salesperson retention in order to provide our customers high quality customer service and in an effort to comply with all applicable laws and requirements. Our salespeople are trained to prioritize our customers’ needs and sell merchandise and services that are in our customers’ best interests. Our training program includes classroom training at regional training locations, field training, periodically updated training materials that utilize media, such as web based modules, for interactive training and participation in industry seminars. Additionally, we place special emphasis on training property sales managers, who are key elements to a successful pre-need sales program.
 We generate sales leads through various methods including digital marketing, direct mail, websites, funeral follow-up and sales force cold calling, with the assistance of database mining and other marketing resources. We have created a marketing department to allow us to use more sophisticated marketing techniques to focus more effectively on our lead generation and to direct sales efforts. Sales leads are referred to the sales force to schedule an appointment, either at the customer’s home or at the cemetery location.
 Acquisitions
 We did not complete any acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2019. On January 19, 2018, we acquired six cemetery properties in Wisconsin and their related assets, net of certain assumed liabilities, for cash consideration of $2.5 million, of which $0.8 million was paid at closing. We had been managing these properties since August 2016. We accounted for the purchase of these properties, which were not material individually or in the aggregate, under the acquisition method of accounting. 
Competition
 Our cemeteries and funeral homes generally serve customers that live within a 10 to 15-mile radius of a property’s location. We face competition from other cemeteries and funeral homes located within this localized area. Most of these cemeteries and funeral homes are independently owned and operated, and most of these owners and operators are smaller than we are and have fewer resources than we do. We have historically face limited competition from the two larger publicly held death care companies that have U.S. operations — Service Corporation International and Carriage Services, Inc. — as they do not directly operate cemeteries in the same local geographic areas in which we operate. Furthermore, these companies have historically generated the majority of their revenues from funeral home operations. Based on the relative levels of cemetery and funeral home operations of these publicly traded death care companies, which are disclosed in their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we believe that we are the only publicly held death care company that focuses a majority of its efforts on Cemetery Operations.
 Within a localized area of competition, we compete primarily for at-need sales, because, in general, many of the independently owned, local competitors may not have pre-need sales programs. Most of these competitors do not have as many of the resources that are available to us to launch and grow a substantial pre-need sales program. The number of customers that cemeteries and funeral homes are able to attract is largely a function of reputation and heritage, although competitive pricing, professional service and attractive, well-maintained and conveniently located facilities are also important factors. The sale of cemetery and funeral home products and services on a pre-need basis has increasingly been used by many companies as an important marketing tool. Due to the importance of reputation and heritage, increases in customer base are usually gained over a long period of time.
 10


Competitors within a localized area have an advantage over us if a potential customer’s family members are already buried in the competitor’s cemetery. If either of the two publicly held death care companies identified above operated, or in the future were to operate, cemeteries within close proximity of our cemeteries, they may offer more competition than independent cemeteries and may have a competitive advantage over us to the extent they have greater financial resources available to them due to their size and access to the capital markets.
 REGULATION
 Our funeral operations are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and a trade regulation rule for the funeral industry promulgated thereunder referred to as the “Funeral Rule.” The Funeral Rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices. The preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate, itemized price information and various other disclosures about funeral merchandise and services and prohibit a funeral provider from: (i) misrepresenting legal, crematory and cemetery requirements; (ii) embalming for a fee without permission; (iii) requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation; (iv) requiring consumers to buy certain funeral merchandise or services as a condition for furnishing other funeral merchandise or services; (v) misrepresenting state and local requirements for an outer burial container; and (vi) representing that funeral merchandise and services have preservative and protective value. Additionally, the Funeral Rule requires the disclosure of mark-ups, commissions, additional charges and rebates related to cash advance items. Our operations are also subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those that impose trusting requirements
 Our operations are subject to federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations related to environmental protection, such as the federal Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and Comprehensive Environmental Response ("EPCRA"), Compensation, and Liability Act, that impose legal requirements governing air emissions, waste management and disposal and wastewater discharges.
We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes. OSHA’s regulatory requirement, known as the Hazard Communication Standard, and similar state statutes require us to provide information and training to our employees about hazardous materials used or maintained for our operations. We may also be subject to Tier 1 or Tier 2 Emergency and Hazardous Chemical Inventory reporting requirements under the EPCRA, depending on the amount of hazardous materials maintained on-site at a particular facility. We are also subject to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws, which, among other things, may require that we modify our facilities to comply with minimum accessibility requirements for disabled persons.
 We take various measures to comply with the Funeral Rule and all other laws and regulations to which we are subject, and we believe we are substantially in compliance with these existing laws and regulations.
 Federal, state and local legislative bodies and regulatory agencies frequently propose new laws and regulations, some of which could have a material effect on our operations and on the deathcare industry in general. We cannot accurately predict the outcome of any proposed legislation or regulation or the effect that any such legislation or regulation might have on us.
 Employees
 On January 31, 2019, we announced a profit improvement initiative, as part of our ongoing organizational review, designed to further integrate, streamline and optimize our operations. As part of this profit improvement initiative, during 2019 we undertook certain cost reduction initiatives, which included a reduction of approximately 200 positions of our workforce within our field operations and corporate functions in our headquarters located in Trevose, Pennsylvania.
 As of December 31, 2019, we employed 2,313 full-time, 219 part-time and 14 seasonal employees. 40 of these full-time employees are represented by various unions in Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey and Illinois and are subject to collective bargaining agreements that have expiration dates ranging from September 2020 to May 2023. We believe that our relationship with our employees is generally favorable.
