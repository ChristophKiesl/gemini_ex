Item 1. Business.
Overview
Kratos is a mid-tier government contractor at the forefront of the U.S. Department of Defense’s (the “DoD”) Third Offset Strategy. Kratos is a leading technology, intellectual property and proprietary product and solution company focused on the U.S. and its allies’ national security. Kratos’ primary focus areas are unmanned systems, satellite communications, microwave electronics, cyber security/warfare, missile defense and combat systems. We believe that our technology, intellectual property, proprietary products and designed-in positions on our customers’ platforms and systems is a competitive advantage and high barrier to entry into our markets. Our work force is primarily technically oriented and highly skilled with a significant number holding national security clearances. Our entire organization is focused on executing our strategy of becoming the leading technology and intellectual property based company in our industry. 
Industry Update

Faced with significant budget pressures, in recent years the U.S. Government has implemented reductions in government spending, including reductions in appropriations for the DoD and other federal agencies, pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 (“BCA”), as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Pursuant to the terms of the BCA, a sequestration went into effect in March 2013 resulting in a 7.8% reduction to the DoD budget for fiscal year (the period running from October 1st to September 30th, a “FY”) 2013 to $495.5 billion, excluding funding for military personnel. The DoD budget was approximately $496.0 billion in FY 2014 and remained at a similar level in FY 2015. The DoD base budget excludes funding for overseas contingency operations, such as those in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, which are appropriated separately and are not currently subject to the BCA.
On November 2, 2015, Barack Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, formalizing the terms of a two-year budget agreement which raised the U.S. debt ceiling and lifted the sequestration spending caps by $80.0 billion. Under the budget agreement, the total federal spending increase over the BCA topline funding caps was $50.0 billion in FY 2016 and $30.0 billion in FY 2017, with the amounts divided equally between defense and domestic priorities. The overall discretionary budget was set at $1.067 trillion in FY 2016 and $1.07 trillion in FY 2017. The FY 2016 discretionary defense budget was $548.1 billion, a $25.0 billion increase over the BCA topline funding caps.
Under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, the Obama Administration received $33.0 billion of the $38.0 billion national defense spending increase it sought in FY 2016. In summary the budget agreement:

• | extended the BCA out to 2025;


• | suspended the U.S. debt limit/ceiling until March 2017;

3


• | increased spending caps for FY 2016 and FY 2017 by $80.0 billion, including $50.0 billion in FY 2016 and $30.0 billion in FY 2017, split evenly between defense and domestic priorities; and


• | included a FY 2016 DoD base budget of $548.0 billion and a FY 2016 overseas contingency operation budget of $59.0 billion.

On December 18, 2015, Congress passed and Mr. Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, which provided funding for the U.S. Government for FY 2016, providing $1.1 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through September 2016. Mr. Obama signed a continuing resolution in September 2016, which was extended in December 2016, and provides funding for the U.S. Government at FY 2016 levels through April 28, 2017.
Current Reporting Segments

The Company operates in three reportable segments. The Kratos Government Solutions (“KGS”) reportable segment is comprised of an aggregation of KGS operating segments, including our microwave electronic products, satellite communications, modular systems and rocket support operating segments. The Unmanned Systems (“US”) reportable segment consists of our unmanned aerial system and unmanned ground and seaborne system businesses. The Public Safety & Security (“PSS”) reportable segment provides independent integrated solutions for advanced homeland security, public safety, critical infrastructure, and security and surveillance systems for government and commercial applications. We organize our business segments based primarily on the nature of the products, solutions and services offered. Transactions between segments are negotiated and accounted for under terms and conditions similar to other government and commercial contracts, and these intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. For additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. From a customer and solutions perspective, we view our business as an integrated whole, leveraging skills and assets wherever possible.
Competitive Strengths
Kratos’ primary competitive strengths are our intellectual property, proprietary products, customer relationships and the designed-in position of our technology and products into our customers’ platforms and systems.
Highly specialized experience. Kratos and our work force have years of experience working on and with the U.S. and its allies’ national security platforms and systems.
We believe that Kratos is one of the industry leaders in our core business areas including, unmanned systems, satellite communications, microwave products, missile systems and radars, missile defense, directed energy weapons, cyber security and warfare, and training systems.
Kratos’ work force of approximately 2,900 employees have specialized national security related experience with the majority performing their duties at customer locations, secure manufacturing facilities or critical infrastructure sites.
Specialized national security focus aligned with mission-critical national security priorities. Continued concerns related to the threats posed by certain foreign nations and terrorists have caused the U.S. Government to identify national security as an area of functional and spending priority. Budget pressures, particularly related to DoD spending, have placed a premium on developing and fielding low-cost, high-technology solutions to assist in national security missions. Our primary capabilities and areas of focus, listed below, are strongly aligned with the objectives of the U.S. Government:

• | Unmanned systems


• | Satellite communications and radio frequency detection


• | Electronic warfare, attack, missile, and radar systems


• | Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance


• | Ballistic missile defense


• | Command, control and combat systems


• | Cybersecurity and information assurance


• | Specialized training systems

Diverse base of key contracts with low concentration. Many of our contracts are single-award and or sole source in nature, where Kratos is the only awardee by the customer. In many cases, our ability to obtain single award, sole source contracts is due to our intellectual property, proprietary products, past performance qualifications and relative experience. We have a highly diverse base of contracts with no contract representing more than 5% of 2016 revenue. Our fixed-price contracts, the vast majority of which are production contracts, represent approximately 83% of our 2016 revenue. Our cost-plus-fee 
4

contracts and time and materials contracts represent approximately 12% and 5%, respectively, of our 2016 revenue. We believe our diverse base of key contracts and low reliance on any one contract provides us with a stable, balanced revenue stream.
In-depth understanding of customer missions. We have a reputation for successfully providing mission-critical products, solutions and services to our customers. Our long-term relationships with the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy and other national security related customers and agencies enable us to develop an in-depth understanding of their missions and technical requirements. In addition, the majority of our employees are located at our customer locations, at secure manufacturing facilities or at critical infrastructure locations, all of which provides Kratos with valuable strategic insight into our customers’ ongoing missions and future program requirements. This understanding of our customers’ missions, requirements and needs, in conjunction with the strategic location of our employees, enables us to offer technical solutions tailored to our customers’ specific requirements and evolving mission objectives. In addition, once we are on-site with a customer, we have historically been successful in winning new and recompete business.
Significant cash flow visibility driven by stable backlog. As of December 25, 2016, our total backlog (see Backlog below) was approximately $899.7 million, of which approximately $626.1 million was funded backlog. The majority of our sales are from orders issued under long-term contracts, typically three to five years in duration. Our contract backlog provides visibility into stable future revenue and cash flow over a diverse set of contracts.
Highly skilled employees and an experienced management team. We deliver our services through a skilled and primarily technically oriented workforce of approximately 2,900 employees. Our senior managers have significant experience with U.S. Government agencies, the U.S. military and U.S. Government contractors. Many of our employees hold national security clearances. Members of our management team have experience growing businesses both organically and through acquisitions. We believe that the cumulative experience and differentiated expertise of our personnel in our core focus areas, coupled with our sizable employee base, allow us to qualify for and bid on larger projects in a prime contracting role.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to focus on our core business areas, including Unmanned Systems, Satellite Communications, Cyber Security, Microwave Electronics and Training Systems. We will continue to invest in differentiating technology and intellectual property ownership for our products and systems. We intend to be the leader in designing, developing, demonstrating and delivering to the warfighter leading technology systems very rapidly, for a low cost.
Internal Growth
We are focused on generating internal growth by capitalizing on our intellectual property, proprietary products, current contract base and customer relationships. We will make targeted discretionary investments in strategic growth areas including; unmanned systems, satellite communications, microwave electronics, cyber security and training systems, which have the highest potential for growth and in which we will retain the intellectual property rights.
Expand technology product, solution and service offerings provided to existing customers. We are focused on expanding the technology, products and solutions we provide to our current customers by leveraging our strong relationships, technical capabilities, intellectual property and past performance record and by offering a wider range of comprehensive low-cost technology rich products and solutions. In regard to areas of specialization, our product and solution offerings include manufacturing of specialized defense electronics products, integrated technology solutions for satellite communications and specialized high performance unmanned aerial aircraft, targets, Unmanned Aerial Systems (“UAS”) and Unmanned Ground Systems (“UGS”). We believe our understanding of customer missions, processes, needs and requirements, and our ability to rapidly deliver low cost, technology leading products and solutions, position us well for success in the current constrained budget environment.
Capitalize on current contract base. We are pursuing new program and contract opportunities and awards as we build the business with our expanding technology base, intellectual property ownership, contract portfolio, and product, solution and service offerings. We are also aggressively pursuing several new national security priority areas, including high performance unmanned aerial systems, satellite communications command, control and signal monitoring products, microwave electronics for missiles, radars, electronic warfare and communications, cyber security solutions, specialized training systems, autonomy, artificial intelligence, robotics, directed energy systems, hypersonic systems, electromagnetic rail gun systems and next generation ballistic missile targets. We are also assessing new tactical program areas and platforms to pursue that are consistent with our core capabilities, technology and intellectual property.
Expand customer and contract base. We are focused on expanding our customer base into areas with significant growth opportunities by leveraging our technology, intellectual property, proprietary products, capabilities, industry reputation, 
5

long-term customer relationships and diverse contract base. We anticipate that this expansion will enable us both to pursue larger program opportunities, higher value work and to further diversify our revenue base across additional U.S. Government, international and commercial customers.
Improve operating margins. We believe that we have opportunities to increase our operating margins and improve profitability by capitalizing on our corporate infrastructure investments as our business grows and revenues increase. We are proactively focused on improving efficiencies, reducing costs, and concentrating our efforts on operational excellence.
Invest in strategic growth areas. Over the past several years, we have made significant investments in strategic growth areas including the unmanned tactical aircraft systems area. Specifically, we have increased internally funded research and development, capital expenditures and infrastructure investments, including executive management, bid, proposal and new business capture and pursuit expenses. We have made these investments with the intention of designing and demonstrating high performance jet powered unmanned combat aerial systems. These investments also allow us to retain the intellectual property rights and design packages for these platforms, and to ultimately secure sole source production positions in these strategic growth areas. Specifically, we have invested over $50 million in our UAS through internally funded research and development, contract design retrofit costs for new platforms under development and capital expenditures for aircraft and related equipment related to this strategic growth area.
We invested in internally funded research and development and capital expenditures to build our own UTAP-22 UAS from 2012 to 2015, and demonstrated the capabilities of the UTAP-22 in a flight demonstration in the fall of 2015. As a result, we were awarded a $12.6 million award prime contract from the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) for sensor integration into our UTAP-22 unmanned aerial system the following year. Under this effort, we will integrate certain sensors into our UTAP-22 and will participate in a large, complex flight exercise in 2017. Additionally, we received a $40.8 million single award, cost-share contract from the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) for the Low Cost Attritable Unmanned Aerial System Demonstration (“LCASD”). Under the LCASD contract award, we will design, develop, deliver, demonstrate and test a technical baseline for a high-speed long-range, low-cost limited life-strike UAS. For our investment, we will retain hard and other assets, and important intellectual property, software, data, platform and system rights, which we believe will be critically important and valuable over the expected long-term life of this platform, including with respect to future production opportunities. We also were awarded one of four prime contract awards from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) for the Gremlins program. Under the Gremlins program, DARPA envisions a swarm of approximately 20 high performance UAVs that are deployed by an inflight aircraft, and are later recovered, inflight, by an aircraft. The approximate $3.9 million Phase 1 contracts were awarded to four competing companies, with the intent to ultimately down select to one finalist company over a period of approximately 36 months.
Capitalize on corporate infrastructure investments. In recent periods, we have made significant investments in our senior management and corporate infrastructure related to cyber security threats to our Company, increased and changing regulations we are subject to, and the changing national security environment. These investments also included hiring senior executives with significant experience in the national security industry, strengthening our internal controls over financial reporting and accounting staff in support of public company reporting requirements, and expanding our backlog and bid and proposal pipeline. We expect to be allocating additional resources in our pursuit of new, larger and highly technical contract opportunities. We believe our management experience and corporate infrastructure can support a company with a much larger revenue base than ours. Accordingly, we believe that, to the extent our revenue grows, we will be able to leverage this infrastructure base and increase our operating margins.
Customers
A representative list of our customers in our KGS and US segments during 2016 included the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marines, Missile Defense Agency, Space Command, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Foreign Military Sales (“FMS”), the U.S. Southern Command, Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, Strategic Command (STRATCOM), Special Capabilities Office (SCO), U.S. intelligence community and certain classified customers. In 2016, representative customers in the PSS segment included Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York, Prince George’s County Public Schools, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, JP Morgan Chase, Alamo Colleges, City of Galveston, Texas Orthopedic Hospital, Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, Fidelity, Scripps Clinic, PNC Bank, Halliburton, AT&T, Chevron, Exxon, Calpine Power Plants, DuPont Fabros, BP America, Houston Community College, Siemens, San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and New Flyer.
Revenue from the U.S. Government (which includes FMS) includes revenue from contracts for which we are the prime contractor as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. Government. Revenues from U.S. Government agency customers in aggregate accounted for approximately 60%, 61% and 57% of total revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
6

Revenues from foreign customers were approximately $80.1 million or 12%, $73.2 million or 11%, and $89.0 million or 12% of total revenue for the years ended December 25, 2016, December 27, 2015, and December 28, 2014, respectively.
Backlog

As of December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, our backlog was approximately $899.7 million and $913.8 million, respectively, of which $626.1 million was funded in 2016 and $528.7 million was funded in 2015. Backlog is our estimate of the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the remaining life of awarded contracts and task orders that we have in hand as of the measurement date. Our total backlog consists of funded and unfunded backlog. We define funded backlog as estimated future revenue under government contracts and task orders for which funding has been appropriated by Congress and authorized for expenditure by the applicable agency, plus our estimate of the future revenue we expect to realize from our commercial contracts that are under firm orders. Our funded backlog does not include the full potential value of our contracts because Congress often appropriates funds to be used by an agency for a particular program of a contract on a yearly or quarterly basis even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years. As a result, contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term, and all or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until Congress makes subsequent appropriation and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract.
Unfunded backlog reflects our estimate of future revenue under awarded government contracts and task orders for which either funding has not yet been appropriated or the expenditure has not yet been authorized. Our total backlog does not include estimates of revenue from government wide acquisition contracts (“GWACs”) or General Services Administration (“GSA”) schedules beyond awarded or funded task orders, but our unfunded backlog does include estimates of revenue beyond awarded or funded task orders for other types of indefinite delivery or indefinite quantity contracts based on our experience under such contracts and similar contracts. Unfunded backlog also includes priced options, which consist of the aggregate contract revenues expected to be earned as a result of a customer exercising an option period that has been specifically defined in the original contract award.

Contracts undertaken by us may extend beyond one year. Accordingly, portions are carried forward from one year to the next as part of backlog. Because many factors affect the scheduling of projects, no assurance can be given as to when revenue will be realized on projects included in our backlog. Although funded backlog represents only business that is considered to be firm, we cannot guarantee that cancellations or scope adjustments will not occur. The majority of funded backlog represents contracts with terms that would entitle us to all or a portion of our costs incurred and potential fees upon cancellation by the customer.

Management believes that year-to-year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future revenues. The actual timing of receipt of revenues, if any, on projects included in backlog could change because many factors affect the scheduling of projects. In addition, cancellation or adjustments to contracts may occur. Backlog is typically subject to large variations from quarter to quarter as existing contracts are renewed or new contracts are awarded. Additionally, all U.S. Government contracts included in backlog, whether or not funded, may be terminated at the convenience of the U.S. Government.
Employees
As of December 25, 2016, we had a work force of approximately 2,900 full-time, part-time and on-call employees.
Competition
Our market is competitive and includes a number of companies in the U.S. defense and security system integration industries. Many of the companies that we compete against have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and generate greater revenues than we do. Competition in the KGS and US segments include tier one, large U.S. Government contractors such as Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Raytheon, BAE Systems, L3, Orbital/ATK and Boeing. While we view other government contractors as competitors, we also team with these same companies in joint proposals or in the delivery of our products, solutions and services for customers. Tier two competitors include smaller government contractors such as Mercury Computer, Qinetiq, Cobham and AAR. Intense competition and long operating cycles are key characteristics of our business within the defense industry. It is also common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor or subcontractor on an award may, upon final award of the contract to another competitor, become a subcontractor for the final prime contractor. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously perform as a supplier to or be a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa. The nature of major defense programs, 
7

conducted under binding contracts, allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not frequently found in other industries. Competition in the PSS segment includes Siemens Building Technology, Johnson Controls, and Convergint Technologies, among others.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our ability to win new business include our intellectual property, proprietary products, technology and ability to rapidly design, demonstrate and deliver systems to the warfighter at a low cost. Also important is our past performance qualifications, customer relationships, domain and technology expertise, the ability to replace contract vehicles, the ability to deliver results within budget (time and cost), reputation, accountability, staffing flexibility, and project management expertise. Additionally, our ability to deliver cost effective products, solutions and services that meet our customers’ requirements is a key differentiator. The current federal procurement environment in the government services area is driven primarily by “low price, technically acceptable” contract award decisions. Accordingly, innovation and the ability for a contractor to quickly deliver a low cost, technically compliant solution or product are critical in the current competitive environment. In addition, competitor bid protests have become more prevalent in the current competitive environment, resulting in further delay of contract procurement activity.
In the U.S. defense, IT, and services markets, the U.S. Government has stressed competition and affordability in connection with its future procurement of products and services. This has led to fewer sole source awards, as well as more emphasis on cost competitiveness. In addition, the DoD has announced several initiatives to improve efficiency, refocus priorities, modify contract terms, and enhance DoD best practices including those used to procure goods and services from defense contractors. See the Industry Background section in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Industry Update section in Item 1 “Business” contained within this Annual Report. These initiatives, when implemented, together with planned reductions in defense spending levels, are likely to result in fewer new opportunities for our industry as a whole with more demanding terms. A reduced opportunity set is likely to intensify competition within the industry as companies compete for a more limited set of new programs.
Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to develop new products and services, and enhancements to and applications for our existing products and services. Our research and development expenses were $13.9 million, $16.2 million and $18.6 million in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We intend to continue our focus on research and development as a key strategy for growth, which will focus on investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability. Our current primary internal research and development (“IR&D”) focus areas include unmanned systems, electronic warfare, satellite communications and signal monitoring.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our continued success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, the intellectual skills of our employees and the ability of our employees to continue to innovate. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. 
As of December 25, 2016, we held a number of U.S. and foreign patents. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent. We will continue to file and pursue patent applications when and where appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies. We also encourage our employees to continue to invent and develop new technologies so as to maintain our competitiveness in the marketplace. 
We own or have rights to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names that we use in conjunction with the operation of our business. Certain of our trademarks have also been registered in selected foreign countries.
Government Regulation
We are subject to various government regulations, including various U.S. Government regulations as a contractor and subcontractor to the agencies of the U.S. Government. Among the most significant U.S. Government regulations affecting our business are:

• | the Federal Acquisition Regulations and supplemental agency regulations, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration, and performance under government contracts;


• | the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations;


• | the Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under cost-based government contracts;

8


• | the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from providing anything of value to a foreign official to help obtain, retain or direct business, or obtain any unfair advantages;


• | the False Claims Act and the False Statements Act, which, respectively, impose penalties for payments made on the basis of false facts provided to the government and impose penalties on the basis of false statements, even if they do not result in a payment; and


• | laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data.

We also need special security clearances to continue working on and advancing certain of our projects with the U.S. Government. Classified programs generally will require that we comply with various Executive Orders, federal laws and regulations and customer security requirements that may include restrictions on how we develop, store, protect and share information, and may require our employees to obtain government clearances.
The nature of the work we do for the federal government may also limit the parties who may invest in or acquire us. Export laws may keep us from providing potential foreign acquirers with a review of the technical data they would be acquiring. In addition, there are special requirements for foreign parties who wish to buy or acquire control or influence over companies that control technology or produce goods in the security interests of the U.S. There may need to be a review under the Exon-Florio provisions of the Defense Production Act. Finally, the government may require a prospective foreign owner to establish intermediaries to actually run that part of the company that does classified work, and establishing a subsidiary and its separate operation may make such an acquisition less appealing to such potential acquirers.
In addition, the export from the U.S. of certain of our products may require the issuance of a license by the U.S. Department of Commerce under the Export Administration Act, as amended, and its implementing regulations as kept in force by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, as amended. Some of our products may require the issuance of a license by the U.S. Department of State under the Arms Export Control Act and its implementing regulations, which licenses are generally harder to obtain and take longer to obtain than do Export Administration Act licenses.
Our business may require compliance with state or local laws designed to limit the uses of personal user information gathered online or require online services to establish privacy policies.
Material Availability
We procure critical material and subsystems from both domestic and global supply partners. These supply sources may be single sources for certain components and the material provided may have extended lead times. To support our continuing customer needs, we have taken steps to mitigate sourcing risks. This includes working closely with our suppliers to ensure future material and subsystem availability to support our manufacturing plans. In some cases, we have elected to stock reserve material to ensure future availability.
During fiscal year 2016, the  Company paid $1.9 million to one of its suppliers, 5-D Systems, Inc. (“5-D”) for engineering services rendered to its Unmanned Systems business unit. Steve Fendley, who was promoted in January 2017 to President of our Unmanned Systems Division, is a cofounder and owns 33.3% of 5-D. Going forward, transactions with 5-D will be subject to review and approval by our Audit Committee and our board of directors consistent with the Company's policies regarding related party transactions.
Environmental
Our manufacturing operations are subject to many requirements under environmental laws. In the U.S., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state agencies administer laws that restrict the emission of pollutants into the air, discharges of pollutants into bodies of water and disposal of pollutants in the ground. Violations of these laws can result in significant civil and criminal penalties and incarceration. The failure to obtain a permit for certain activities may be a violation of environmental law and subject the owner and operator to civil and criminal sanctions. Most environmental agencies also have the power to shut down an operation if it is operating in violation of environmental law. U.S. laws also typically allow citizens to bring private enforcement actions in some situations. Outside the U.S., the environmental laws and their enforcement vary and may be more burdensome. We have management programs and processes in place that are intended to minimize the potential for violations of these laws.
Other environmental laws, primarily in the U.S., address the contamination of land and groundwater and require the clean-up of such contamination. These laws may apply not only to the owner or operator of an on-going business, but also to the owner of land contaminated by a prior owner or operator. In addition, if a parcel is contaminated by the release of a 
9

hazardous substance, such as through its historic use as a disposal site, any person or company that has contributed to that contamination, whether or not it has a legal interest in the land, may be subject to a requirement to clean up the parcel.
