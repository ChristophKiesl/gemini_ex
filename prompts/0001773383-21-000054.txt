ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We offer the market-leading software intelligence platform, purpose-built for dynamic multicloud environments. As enterprises embrace the cloud to effect their digital transformation, our all-in-one intelligence platform is designed to address the growing complexity faced by technology and digital business teams. With automatic and intelligent observability, our all-in-one platform delivers precise answers about the performance and security of applications, the underlying infrastructure and the experience of all users to enable organizations to innovate faster, simplify cloud complexity, collaborate more efficiently, and secure cloud-native applications. We designed our software intelligence platform to allow our customers to modernize and automate IT operations, develop and release high-quality software faster, and improve user experiences for consistently better business outcomes. As a result, as of March 31, 2021, our products are trusted by approximately 2,900 Dynatrace customers in 90 countries in diverse industries such as banking, insurance, retail, manufacturing, government, travel and software.
Today’s leading organizations are striving to deliver innovative, high-performance digital services to expand market opportunities, compete more effectively, and operate with increased agility. This transformation is happening in multicloud environments, which bring a scale and frequency of change that is exponentially greater than that of the old data-center world. Developing and operating these environments is harder than ever, driven by:
1)Hybrid, multicloud architectures: Organizations are building and deploying software across hybrid environments with multiple clouds and on-premises platforms.
2)Application complexity: Applications are increasingly complex and deployed as microservices-based architectures that are written in multiple different programming languages with hundreds of loosely coupled service connections. 
3)Application security: The move to agile methodologies, such as DevSecOps, combined with the complexity of new, cloud-native applications and infrastructure, as well as the higher frequency with which code is pushed into production has heightened the need for application security practices which can detect vulnerabilities and automatically enable remediation across the software development cycle. 
4)DevOps: Ensuring software updates work without issues has grown more challenging due to the increased frequency of software releases, reduced testing time, and the use of independent development teams.
5)User experience: User expectations for software performance have rapidly increased, and enterprises are focused on advancing branded experiences to maximize revenue, differentiate offerings, and retain competitive positions.
Traditional approaches for developing, operating, monitoring, and securing software were not designed to keep pace with dynamic multicloud environments. Traditional monitoring solutions were developed for applications that are monolithic, updated infrequently, and run in static data-center environments. These solutions are difficult to deploy, narrow in scope, and designed to operate in a simpler, siloed environment. Each tool in this approach only collects data about individual components of the computing stack, such as applications, infrastructures, logs, networks, or user experiences. To get an end-to-end view using these traditional approaches, IT teams are required to aggregate and correlate data from these disparate monitoring solutions to identify actionable answers, including where bottlenecks occur, how best to optimize for performance and scalability, if an issue is impacting service, and if so, where to find the problem and what to do about it.
With the advent of dynamic multicloud environments, the challenges and limitations of traditional solutions have been exacerbated. What was once a well understood layering of applications running on operating systems on physical servers connected to physical networks has rapidly become virtualized into software at all levels. Environments have become dynamic. Applications are no longer monolithic and have become fragmented into thousands, potentially millions, of microservices, written in multiple software languages. These multicloud environments sprawl from traditional backend applications run on relational databases and mainframes to modern IaaS platforms run on Amazon Web Services, or AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. All these factors result in an environment that is web-scale, extremely complex, and dynamic at all layers of the new computing stack.
We believe the scale, complexity, and dynamic nature of dynamic multicloud environments, including the applications that run on them, require a comprehensive observability, AIOps, automation, and security strategy we refer to as “software intelligence.” Starting in 2014, we leveraged the knowledge and experience of the same engineering team that founded Dynatrace to develop a solution to address the disruptive shift to dynamic multicloud environments. These efforts resulted in the creation of a new platform, the Dynatrace Software Intelligence Platform, or Dynatrace®.
The Dynatrace® platform leverages an automatic instrumentation technology called OneAgent®, a real-time dependency mapping system called SmartScape®, our transaction-centric code analysis technology called PurePath®, and an open artificial intelligence, or AI, engine called Davis® for instant answers to degradations in service, anomalies in behavior, and user impact. Dynatrace® simplifies 
the complexity of dynamic multicloud environments for cloud architects, DevOps and SRE teams, as well as application and operations teams, while providing actionable insights that accelerate cloud migrations, cloud adoption, and DevOps success.
Unlike traditional multiple-tool-approaches, we integrated Dynatrace® with key components of multicloud ecosystems to support dynamic cloud orchestration, including for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, VMware Tanzu, Red Hat OpenShift, and Kubernetes. In these environments, Dynatrace® automatically launches, monitors and observes the full cloud stack and all the applications and containers running anywhere in the stack, including applications and workloads that may traverse multiple public cloud and hybrid-cloud environments. We believe our ability to integrate Dynatrace® with cloud platforms simplifies development and operational efforts, increases visibility, and improves situational awareness for our customers.
We designed Dynatrace® to maximize flexibility and control of the rich observability data captured and analyzed by our platform. We believe the platform provides the simplicity of software-as-a-service (SaaS), with the customer option of either maintaining data in the cloud, or at the edge in customer-provisioned infrastructure, which we refer to as Dynatrace® Managed. In this managed offering, we provide updates and enhancements automatically each month while allowing customers the flexibility and control to adhere to their own data security and sovereignty requirements.
We market Dynatrace® through a combination of our global direct sales team and a network of partners, including resellers, system integrators, and managed service providers. We target the largest 15,000 global organizations, which generally have annual revenues in excess of $1 billion.
The Dynatrace® Software Intelligence Platform has been commercially available since 2016. The number of Dynatrace® customers increased to 2,936 as of March 31, 2021 from 2,373 as of March 31, 2020, representing year-over-year growth of 24%. Our Dynatrace® net expansion rate was above 120% as of March 31, 2021 for the 12th consecutive quarter. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Metrics” included under Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report.
For financial information regarding our business, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included under Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report and our consolidated audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
The economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been challenging for certain customers and may continue to be challenging for some of our customers in the future. While revenue, customer retention, and earnings are relatively predictable under a subscription-based business model, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic will not be fully reflected in the results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods given the current macroeconomic uncertainty.
Industry Background
Key trends impacting the way organizations develop, manage, and optimize their software environment include:
Software Applications Are Central to Digital Transformation for Organizations Across All Sectors
Whether it is retailers driving higher customer engagement through mobile apps, industrial companies reducing production downtime with predictive maintenance applications, or automobile manufacturers designing self-driving cars, software is central to how organizations deliver a differentiated user experience. At the same time, organizations increasingly embed software throughout their operations, managing business critical systems, such as payments processing, inventory and supply chain management, logistics, and many other front- and back-office services.
A study by International Data Corporation (IDC) states the majority, 65%, of global GDP will be digitalized by 2022, driving $6.8 trillion of IT spending from 2020 to 2023. Digital transformation requires significant modernization of legacy environments, shifting from high cost, labor intensive, and inflexible technology systems to a modern, cloud-native architecture. IDC also forecasts that by 2024, there will be 520 million new, modern applications and services launched – more than the total number of applications developed in the previous 40 years. Maintaining visibility across a broad multicloud environment represents a significant challenge. As a result, digital transformations are slow, often disrupted by performance issues, and can fail to achieve intended objectives.
To remain competitive, organizations now focus more of their budget on software innovation and less on operating and maintaining systems. IDC reports that by 2023, 75% of Global 2000 IT organizations will adopt automated operations practices to transform their IT workforce to support unprecedented scale. As a result, organizations are investing in new platforms that are built to automate the development, deployment, and operation of modern, cloud-native software applications and infrastructure, and accelerate the transition to dynamic multicloud environments. 
Changing Customer Expectations are Requiring Organizations to Prioritize the User Experience
Organizations are increasingly seeking to differentiate their products and services based on user experiences, with digital interaction becoming the primary channel of communication between enterprises and their customers, partners, and employees. A report by Forrester suggests, customers who have a better experience are more likely to stay with a brand, buy additional products and services from the brand, and recommend it to friends. The result is more retained revenue from reduced customer churn, more revenue per customer, and more new customers. Conversely, according to a 2018 report by NewVoiceMedia (now known as the Vonage Salesforce Contact Center solution), U.S. companies lose $75 billion per year due to poor customer experiences, a $13 billion increase from 2016. Faced with poor customer service, 39% of respondents indicated they would never use the offending company again.
User experience is closely tied to the performance of software applications. As a result, optimal application and infrastructure performance as well as exceptional user experiences are important to the entire organization, not just to the IT staff that maintain these environments. We believe the need for an exceptional user experience to engage and retain customers will continue to drive demand for instrumentation that helps enterprises to provide high quality, user-focused outcomes.
Benefits of Dynamic Multicloud Environments Make Them Essential for Digital Transformation
Large-size organizations are increasingly adopting cloud technologies to increase agility and accelerate innovation. According to IDC in 2020, 97% of worldwide enterprises that used cloud infrastructure relied on more than one cloud platform. In addition, Gartner predicts that by 2025, 85% of enterprises will have a cloud-first principle. The key advantages of dynamic multicloud environments include:
•Ability to build better applications at a faster rate. Cloud-based application development technologies, such as container and microservices architectures, enable organizations to focus developer resources more on creating and improving value-add application features and less on managing underlying operating systems and infrastructure. Gartner estimates that by 2025, 85% of organizations will run containers in production, up from less than 30% in 2020. In addition to new cloud-based development technologies, enterprises are adopting new processes, such as DevOps and Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps), that help accelerate the software delivery cycle.
•Operational efficiency. Organizations are moving to the cloud to reduce spending on expensive and static systems, the data centers to house them, the energy to run them, and the IT staff needed to maintain them.
•Agility. Organizations can purchase cloud services dynamically as demand ebbs and flows over time, affording greater flexibility, financial efficiencies, and scale than traditional systems. Organizations can scale capacity up and down to address seasonality or quickly address unexpected spikes in demand without needing to purchase and maintain infrastructure for peak demand and leaving it underutilized during other times.
Shift to Dynamic Multicloud Environments Introduces Fundamentally New Software Delivery Challenges
While the cloud offers enterprises some clear advantages over traditional systems, moving to the cloud also creates fundamental new challenges, such as:
•Greater complexity. Multicloud strategies require that IT teams manage applications and infrastructure and ensure interoperability of operations between private and multiple public clouds, such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and SAP. In addition, these applications are containerized and increasingly fragmented into microservices that are hosted across multiple cloud platforms, creating interdependencies across heterogeneous environments that increase the risk of incompatibility issues and the number of potential failure points if the applications are not deployed and maintained correctly.
•Highly dynamic environments. Cloud infrastructure and applications are built to scale up or down in real-time depending upon usage and traffic. The automation required to monitor these highly dynamic environments is beyond what is required for monolithic, on-premises applications.
•Massive scale. As software becomes more critical to business success, the number and size of applications will continue to grow and encompass more features and greater functionality. At the same time, web-scale architectures are enabling enterprises to build applications that are deployed across thousands of hosts and serve millions of users simultaneously. The breadth of functionality and scale of deployments of dynamic multicloud applications regularly exceed even the largest applications built in the pre-cloud era.
•More frequent changes to software. The adoption of DevOps practices and cloud architectures have increased the speed at which software updates can be developed and deployed. With the application development lifecycle accelerating, enterprises must adapt their software operations environment and culture to ensure that performance and business outcomes are not adversely affected by frequent changes.
Traditional Monitoring Approaches Were Not Built for Dynamic Multicloud Environments
Traditional application monitoring approaches were built before dynamic multicloud environments became the driving force in digital transformation and suffer from significant shortcomings when applied in cloud-based environments. Challenges of traditional monitoring solutions for multicloud environments include:
•Manual configuration processes that do not scale. Traditional monitoring tools require unique agents for each component of an application and rely on IT personnel to manually pre-configure each agent. The complexity and dynamic nature of multicloud environments, which can include thousands of containers and microservices, makes this multi-agent approach costly, slow, and impractical to install and maintain, especially as these environments are rapidly modified and updated.
•Not designed to capture data across the full multicloud stack. Traditional monitoring solutions were created to view a limited portion of the full technology stack, and provide visibility only into individual applications or workloads, and are unable to provide full-stack observability into how the applications, microservices, and infrastructure are interconnected. To get a complete view of the full technology stack, from the applications to the underlying infrastructure to the user experience, IT personnel must manually implement and manage many disparate tools. We believe this approach has resulted in organizations overinvesting in operations and underinvesting in development, which slows innovation.
•Only able to provide data, not answers. Traditional monitoring tools provide data only about narrow components of the technology stack. As a result, IT teams must manually integrate and correlate the data from disparate systems and apply their own assumptions to identify the underlying cause of performance issues. This process is slow, prone to errors, and is made especially challenging by the complexity of multicloud environments.
•Collect limited snapshots of data that do not provide real-time observability. Traditional APM tools were not designed for the far larger and more complex data sets produced by multicloud environments and can only capture snapshots of application and infrastructure performance data and user data. Traditional monitoring approaches rely on partial data sets, which reduce their effectiveness in performing precise root-cause determination, add risk, and delay innovation. In addition, traditional monitoring tools and approaches do not provide visibility into containers and microservices, which leads to blind spots in software performance monitoring when used in container-based environments.
•Lack of flexible deployment options. Traditional monitoring solutions are either deployed as SaaS-only or on-premises-only. SaaS-only solutions often fail to meet the strict governance, security, and scale requirements of large enterprises, and do not monitor on-premises applications, making them incompatible with the needs of organization who manage hybrid-hosted applications. Conversely, traditional on-premises solutions were not built to manage cloud applications and are typically upgraded less frequently, and thus innovate more slowly than cloud-based applications.
Our Solution
Dynatrace offers the market-leading software intelligence platform, purpose-built for dynamic multicloud environments. We built the Dynatrace® Software Intelligence Platform from the ground up to meet the challenges of running and optimizing these environments and the applications and services that run across them. Our AI-powered, full-stack, and completely automated platform provides deep observability into dynamic, multicloud ecosystems. In addition, Dynatrace® provides real-time, actionable insights about the performance and security of our customers’ entire software ecosystem by integrating high-fidelity, web-scale data, mapping its dependencies in real-time, and analyzing them with an open, explainable AI engine. Dynatrace® is brought to market through our global direct sales force and a network of partners. The combination of our market-leading platform and go-to-market strategy has allowed us to achieve the scale, growth, and margins we believe will provide us the capital to continue investing in driving further product differentiation.
Our platform provides the following key benefits:
•Single agent, fully automated configuration. Dynatrace® is installed as a single agent, OneAgent®, which automatically configures itself, and continuously discovers all components of the full-stack to enable high fidelity and web-scale data capture. OneAgent® dynamically profiles the performance of all components of the full-stack with code-level precision, even as applications and environments update and change.
•Full-stack, all-in-one approach with deep cloud integrations. Dynatrace® combines Application and Microservices Monitoring, with Application Security, Infrastructure Monitoring, Digital Experience Management, Business Analytics, and Cloud Automation and in a single platform. We believe this all-in-one approach reduces the need for a variety of disparate tools and enables our customers to improve productivity and decision making while reducing operating costs. Dynatrace® provides out-of-the-box configuration for the leading cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Red Hat OpenShift, VMware Tanzu, and SAP, as well as coverage for traditional on-premises systems, including mainframe and monolithic applications in a single, easy-to-use, intelligent platform.
•AI-powered, answer-centric insights. Davis®, our explainable AI engine, dynamically baselines the performance of all components in the full stack, continually learning normal performance thresholds to provide precise answers when performance deviates from expected or desired conditions. Unlike ML-based correlation engines that overwhelm IT professionals with hundreds of alerts from many different tools, Dynatrace® provides a single problem resolution and precise root-cause determination. We believe the accuracy and precision of the answers delivered by our AI engine enable our customers to shift from reactive to proactive remediation, providing a substantial advantage in time savings, resource efficiency, customer satisfaction, and business outcomes.
•Web-scale and enterprise grade. Dynatrace® utilizes big data architecture and enterprise-proven cloud technologies that are engineered for web-scale environments. With role-based access and advanced security functionality, we built Dynatrace® purposefully for enterprise-wide adoption by the largest organizations in the world.
•Flexible deployment options. We deploy our platform as a SaaS solution, with the option of retaining the data in the cloud, or at the edge in customer-provisioned infrastructure, which we refer to as Dynatrace® Managed. The Dynatrace® Managed offering allows customers to maintain control of the environment where their data resides, whether in the cloud or on-premises, combining the simplicity of SaaS with the ability to adhere to their own data security and sovereignty requirements. Our Mission Control center automatically upgrades all Dynatrace® instances and offers on-premises cluster customers auto-deployment options that suit their specific enterprise management processes.
Our Opportunity
As dynamic, multicloud computing replaces traditional data centers, we believe our full-stack, all-in-one, software intelligence platform, Dynatrace®, can expand our potential market opportunity by allowing us to offer our solutions into adjacent markets beyond APM. These include replacing traditional monitoring tools, and potentially disrupting various well-established IT spending categories, such as infrastructure monitoring, application security, alert and incident management, and network monitoring. They also include new categories including multicloud observability, AIOps, and automation for IT and DevOps processes. According to Gartner, the global IT operations software market was estimated to be $35 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.3% to $50 billion in 2025.
We believe a significant portion of our market opportunity remains unpenetrated today. Gartner estimates enterprises will quadruple their APM use due to increasingly digitized business processes from 2018 through 2021, to reach 20% of all business applications. As this trend continues, we believe there is an opportunity to increase our annual recurring revenue as enterprise customers expand the number of applications instrumented.
Currently, we estimate the annual potential market opportunity for our Dynatrace® solution to be approximately $50 billion, $32 billion of which is based on a bottom-up calculation that relates to our existing revenue generating modules. We calculated this figure using the largest 15,000 global enterprises with greater than $1 billion in annual revenue, as identified by S&P Capital IQ in September 2020. We then banded these companies by revenue scale and multiplied the total number of companies in each band by our calculated annualized booking per customer for companies in each respective band. We calculated the annualized bookings per customer, applied for each band, using internal company data of actual customer spend. For each respective band, we calculated the average annualized bookings per customer of the top 10% of customers in the band, which we believe to be representative of having achieved broader implementation of our solutions within their enterprises. The additional $18 billion represents the market opportunity related to our newest cloud application security module and is based on a combination of software markets forecast information from Gartner.1 We believe our potential market opportunity could expand further as enterprises increasingly instrument, monitor, and optimize more of their applications and underlying infrastructure.
Our Growth Strategy
•Extend our technology and market leadership position. We intend to maintain our position as the market-leading software intelligence platform through increased investment in research and development and continued innovation. We expect to focus on expanding the functionality of Dynatrace® and investing in capabilities that address new market opportunities. We believe this strategy will enable new growth opportunities and allow us to continue to deliver differentiated high-value outcomes to our customers. 
•Grow our customer base. We intend to drive new customer growth by expanding our direct sales force focused on the largest 15,000 global enterprise accounts, which generally have annual revenues in excess of $1 billion. The initial average Dynatrace® ARR for these new customers was approximately $105,000, in fiscal 2021. In addition, we expect to leverage our global partner ecosystem to add new customers in geographies where we have direct coverage and work

Wheeler, Rustam Malik, et al., 9 July 2020, calculations performed by Dynatrace, using Application Security and Cloud Workload Protection Platform markets and Security Information and Event Management market segment.
jointly with our partners. In other geographies, we utilize a multi-tier “master reseller” model, such as in Africa, Japan, the Middle East, Russia, and South Korea.
•Increase penetration within existing customers. We plan to continue to increase the penetration within our existing customers by expanding the breadth of our platform capabilities to provide for continued cross-selling opportunities. In addition, we believe the ease of implementation for Dynatrace® provides us the opportunity to expand adoption within our existing enterprise customers, across new customer applications, and into additional business units or divisions. Once customers are on the Dynatrace® platform, we have seen significant dollar-based net expansion due to the ease of use and power of our new platform. This expansion rate has been above 120% for 12 consecutive quarters.
•Enhance our strategic partner ecosystem. Our strategic partners include industry-leading system integrators, software vendors, and cloud and technology providers. We intend to continue to invest in our partner ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on expanding our strategic alliances and cloud-focused partnerships, such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Red Hat OpenShift, ServiceNow, and VMware Tanzu.
The Dynatrace Software Intelligence Platform
Dynatrace® is a software intelligence platform, purpose-built for dynamic multicloud environments. Dynatrace® provides application and microservices monitoring (“APM”), application security, infrastructure monitoring, digital experience monitoring (“DEM”), business analytics, and cloud automation in an easy-to-use, highly automated, all-in-one solution. We engineered Dynatrace® to simplify the operation of complex multicloud environments and capture a wide variety of high-fidelity application, infrastructure, user experience, and open source telemetry data at scale. With this broad set of observability data, the Dynatrace platform dynamically maps all components in a full-stack environment and their dependencies for real-time, continuous context to provide answers to issues, bottlenecks, degradations, and more using our proprietary AI engine, Davis®. In addition, our platform provides automation, including continuous discovery, proactive anomaly detection, and optimization across the software lifecycle. We believe this combination of unparalleled observability, AI, and automation across the full multicloud ecosystem enables our customers to modernize and automate IT operations more easily, develop and release higher quality software faster, and deliver superior user experiences consistently.
Our proprietary, single-agent technology, OneAgent®, automatically and continuously discovers metrics, logs, traces, code, user experience data and more to simplify implementation and the ongoing operation of dynamic multicloud environments. We believe OneAgent® offers significant time savings to our customers by providing them the ability to automate ongoing deployment, continuous configuration, and periodic upgrades, which allows customers to quickly, efficiently, and effectively monitor more applications. In addition, when agents are not possible or necessary, customers can send OpenTelemetry data directly to the Dynatrace® platform. As a result, customers can use the OpenTelemetry open-source standard from any data source, and leverage Dynatrace’s AI and automation capabilities to deliver predictability and precise actionability across their cloud-native technologies. 
Our SmartScape® technology continually maps a complete topology of the full stack of modern software components and continuously updates in real-time to provide a comprehensive view of how virtual networks and infrastructure are running, what and where containers and applications are running, how processes are behaving, and how all these entities are connected and performing.
With automatic baselining, the Davis® AI engine continually learns what normal performance is, processing billions of dependencies in milliseconds, to serve up answers that are beyond human capabilities. This allows our Davis® AI engine to provide precise root-cause problem identification, enabling faster decision making, greater optimization of IT resources, and consistently better business outcomes.
We engineered Dynatrace® for web-scale, multicloud environments with enterprise-grade governance and security and the ability to provide custom and secure role-based application and topology viewing access. We designed Dynatrace® to be highly scalable to capture and analyze massive data sets produced by multicloud environments in real-time. We believe collecting high-fidelity data in one common architecture improves the intelligence of our AI engine and provides more precise answers about software performance and user activity across the full stack. Using an application program interface (“API”), customers can extend Dynatrace® into common IT operations toolsets like ServiceNow and Atlassian’s software portfolio, enriching information users receive, increasing automation of business processes, and providing incremental context to improve decision making and drive greater IT operational efficiency.
Dynatrace® is a full-stack, all-in-one platform that performs Infrastructure Monitoring, APM, Application Security, DEM, Business Analytics, and Cloud Automation. Customers typically start with APM and expand to include DEM for experience management and Infrastructure Monitoring. Davis®, our AI engine, is part of every Dynatrace® license since it is a core component of our software intelligence approach.
We deploy our platform as a SaaS solution, with data hosted in the cloud or at the edge on customer-provisioned infrastructure. This latter option we refer to as “Managed,” as we provide monthly, automatic updates and enhancements while allowing customers the flexibility and control to adhere to their own data security and sovereignty requirements.
Applications and Microservices Monitoring
Our approach to APM changes the way our customers monitor applications and manage transactions across highly complex multicloud environments. Because cloud applications are dynamic, we engineered our instrumentation to be automatic. Because cloud applications run on shared infrastructure and leverage shared services, we monitor the full stack to provide visibility into distributed transactions and underlying code (via PurePath®) as well as entity relationships and dependencies (via SmartScape®). Because dynamic multicloud environments are virtualized layers of software, we gather metrics and telemetry beyond transaction data, including user experience, log and event data, and data from the latest open-source standards, such as OpenTelemetry. And because multicloud environments are highly complex, we analyze all data in the context of their dependencies via our AI engine (Davis®). This combination of capabilities allows our customers to manage web-scale cloud environments easily, with continuous observability and insights into cloud operations, DevOps software delivery pipelines, and business outcomes. Application coverage includes, though is not limited to, traditional web and mobile environments, such as Java, .NET, and PHP; modern environments, such as Node.js and GoLang, database environments both SQL and NoSQL; mainframe environments such as CICS and IMS; and the latest serverless technologies, such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Microsoft Azure Functions.
Application Security
Traditional approaches to application security cannot keep up with constantly changing multicloud environments and fast-moving DevSecOps processes, causing blind spots and uncertainty about exposures and their impact on cloud-native applications. When vulnerabilities are detected, current approaches require manual processes that deliver imprecise risk and impact analysis and force teams to waste time chasing false positives. In addition, DevSecOps processes place more responsibility on developers to ensure code does not have vulnerabilities. With current sampled or scheduled scan results, even the most common and well-documented vulnerabilities can remain undetected and open for hackers to exploit.
In December 2020, we introduced Dynatrace® Application Security on the Dynatrace® platform. Application Security enables development teams to accelerate DevSecOps processes through automation and the elimination of mundane work. Runtime Application Self-Protection automatically and continuously analyzes applications, libraries, and code at runtime in production and pre-production. In addition, Application Security provides the C-suite confidence in the security of their cloud-native production deployments. 
Infrastructure Monitoring
Dynatrace® includes Infrastructure Monitoring to provide full visibility into the infrastructure layer across public, private, and multicloud environments. We offer extensive coverage, including integrations with cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure, Google 
Cloud Platform, VMware Tanzu, Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes, by utilizing our OneAgent® instrumentation and powerful API ingestion capabilities to provide a single source of analysis across environments.
We natively and automatically monitor containers and the microservices running inside of them, without the need to manually instrument each container. Our analysis includes full observability into server metrics, including CPU, memory, network performance, and processes running on these hosts, including virtualized components. We also capture all relevant log files and put them in context of a transaction or a problem analysis to allow for richer detail and faster decision making.
Infrastructure Monitoring from Dynatrace® is part of our full-stack agent deployment or can be licensed in an infrastructure-only mode for host environments that do not require application analysis, such as third-party SaaS apps, directory services, middleware services, certificate services, and other hybrid-cloud infrastructure. 
Digital Experience Management
Dynatrace® provides intelligence into the digital experience of end users and how the software can be optimized to enhance user experience and maximize conversions. Our coverage spans across multiple applications to provide a single view of a customer journey across mobile, web, kiosk, SaaS applications, and IoT devices. Dynatrace® integrates three user experience capabilities into one Digital Experience Management solution—Real User Monitoring (“RUM”), Synthetic Monitoring, and Session Replay. We believe this integration simplifies use, accelerates adoption, and increases value for our customers.
Dynatrace® RUM automatically captures every user click, tap, and swipe, regardless of device, across targeted applications. This capability is designed to enables our customers to quickly determine the impact that performance has on their conversion rates and revenue. Dynatrace monitors at a user journey level to preserve a user’s context for analysis, reporting, customer care and cross-channel tracking (e.g., a journey that traverses a mobile device and PC, or IoT devices and mobile device).
Dynatrace® Synthetic Monitoring provides a proactive view into application and API performance and availability without the need for a live user of the application and can do so from multiple locations around the world. In addition, Dynatrace customers can extend test locations and test additional applications via using private on-premises nodes. Simulated user visits are scripted by clicking through an application as a user would, and then provisioned and monitored by our SaaS DEM portal. Our customers use synthetic monitoring for proactive alerting and service level agreement management for both internally built cloud applications as well as for monitoring and third-party applications, such as Salesforce, Zoom, NetSuite, ServiceNow, and more.
Dynatrace® Session Replay provides digital business teams, customer care teams, and DevOps teams a visual recording of a real user’s journey, including what they saw, what they clicked-on, how they traversed the application, and how they converted or where they abandoned. This expands Dynatrace’s® capabilities beyond user experience monitoring and into user behavior monitoring and analysis.
All Dynatrace® DEM capabilities use a common user interface, a common dashboard and reporting system, and a common licensing scheme called “DEM units.” Customers license DEM separately and the license supports all three capabilities.
Digital Business Analytics
Dynatrace® Digital Business Analytics provides real-time, AI-powered answers to business questions using data already flowing through Dynatrace’s APM and DEM modules. By tying user experience, customer behavior, and application performance data together with business metrics, Digital Business Analytics provides automatic answers about conversions, orders, churn, release validation, and customer segmentation. Traditionally, application owners and business users have used disparate, siloed tools and have manually analyzed data, which hampered their ability to run and optimize their digital business offerings in real-time. Dynatrace’s AI engine Davis® is at the core of Digital Business Analytics. Davis® continually learns what expected “normal” business performance looks like and provides proactive answers to issues, enabling faster decision making, greater optimization of resources, and consistently better business outcomes. Over time, we believe Digital Business Analytics could expand our total addressable market by several billion dollars, as we enter and expand our offerings into a segment of the larger Analytics and Business Intelligence market. According to Gartner, the Analytics and Business Intelligence market within the Enterprise Application Software macro-market is estimated to be $27.4 billion globally in 2020.
Cloud Automation
In February 2021, we introduced the Dynatrace® Cloud Automation Module on the Dynatrace® platform. Cloud Automation provides developers, DevOps and SRE teams with an integrated, end-to-end observability platform across production and pre-production cloud environments, bringing together full lifecycle observability with automated delivery pipelines that span multiple clouds. This results in shorter innovation cycles, higher quality software, and faster time to market.
Cloud Automation comes with a fully supported version of Keptn, an open-source initiative, providing customers with an enterprise-grade control plane for cloud-native application lifecycle orchestration. This allows for seamless integration of DevOps toolchains with Dynatrace’s automatic and intelligent platform, extending our openness and support for the broader DevOps ecosystem.

Prior to launching Dynatrace® in 2016, our solutions consisted of the following suite of APM products: AppMon, Classic Real User Monitoring, Synthetic Classic and Network Application monitoring, collectively, the Classic products. As of April 2018, the Classic products were only available to customers who had previously purchased these products and as of April 1, 2021, the Classic products reached end of support. The Classic products made up 1% of Total ARR at the end of March 2021.
Research and Development
Our research and development (“R&D”) organization is responsible for designing, developing, testing, and operating all aspects of our software intelligence offerings, including addressing new use cases, adding new innovative capabilities, extending the scale and scope of our technology, and embracing modern cloud and AI technologies while maintaining high quality.
We utilize an agile development process with 100% test automation to deliver approximately 25 major software releases per year and hundreds of minor releases, fixes and currency updates. We believe the full-stack monitoring required by dynamic multicloud environments requires a highly efficient and agile process to enable high-performing software across the diverse, dynamic cloud ecosystems of our customers.
Our primary R&D labs are in Austria, Poland, and Spain. We believe that our extensive European lab network is an advantage in driving lower costs, higher quality software, and a more stable workforce.

Intellectual Property
Dynatrace relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection. As of March 31, 2021, we had 84 issued patents, 67 of which are in the United States, and 29 pending applications, of which 21 are in the United States. Our issued patents expire at various dates through April 2039. We cannot be assured that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow the scope of the claims sought. Any future patents issued to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
We have registered “Dynatrace” and the “Dynatrace” logo as trademarks in the United States and other jurisdictions for our name and our product as well as certain other words and phrases that we use in our business, including “One Agent”, “PurePath”, “SmartScape” and “Davis”. We have registered numerous Internet domain names related to our business. We also license software from third parties for integration into our applications and utilize open-source software.
We enter into agreements with our employees, contractors, customers, partners, and other parties with which we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on any legal actions against these infringers being successful, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.
Furthermore, effective patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available over the Internet. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving.
Competition
The market for software application monitoring and analytics solutions is evolving, complex, and defined by changing technology and customer needs. We expect competition to intensify in the future as competitors bundle new and more competitive offerings with their existing products and services, and as products and product enhancements are introduced into our markets. As we have expanded our capabilities beyond traditional APM, we increasingly compete with a wider range of vendors. We expect competition to continually evolve as enterprises shift to dynamic multicloud environments and as more mature vendors look to provide a holistic approach to monitoring.
We compete either directly or indirectly with:
•APM vendors, such as Cisco and New Relic;
•Infrastructure monitoring vendors, such as BMC, Datadog, and Nagios;
•DEM vendors, such as Akamai and Catchpoint;
•Application Security vendors, such as Palo Alto Networks, Synopsys, and Veracode;
•Open source and commercial open source vendors such as Elastic and Grafana;
•Point solutions from public cloud providers; and
•IT operations management, AIOps, and business intelligence providers with offerings that cover some portion of the capabilities we provide.
In addition to the above companies, we also face potential competition from vendors in adjacent markets that may offer capabilities that overlap with ours. We may also face competition from companies entering our market, including large technology companies which that could expand their platforms or acquire one of our competitors.
The principal competitive factors in our markets are:
•artificial intelligence capabilities;
•automation;
•product features, functionality, and reliability;
•ease and cost of deployment, use and maintenance;
•deployment options and flexibility;
•customer, technology, and platform support;
•ability to easily integrate with customers software application and IT infrastructure environments;
•the quality of data collection and correlation;
•interoperability and ease of integration; and
•brand recognition.
While we believe we compete favorably on the basis of the foregoing factors, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to certain of our current and future competitors as they may be able to devote greater resources to the development and improvement of their products and services than we can and, as a result, may be able to respond more quickly to technological changes and customers’ changing needs. Moreover, because our market is changing rapidly, it is possible that new entrants, especially those with substantial resources, more efficient operating models, more rapid product development cycles or lower marketing costs, could introduce new products and services that disrupt the manner in which our all-in-one, highly automated approach addresses the needs of our customers and potential customers.
Human Capital Management
Headcount
We believe that our success is in large part due to the drive, creativity and the overall strength of our workforce. As of March 31, 2021, we had 2,779 employees operating within 30 countries, with 64% outside of the United States including 676 within Austria. In 
countries in which we operate we are subject to local labor law requirements. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe that our employee relations are strong. 
The health and safety of our colleagues and anyone who enters our workplace around the world is of paramount importance to us. During this past fiscal year, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted a work from home policy to keep our employees safe in accordance with local and national health agency guidelines. Our senior leadership communicated frequently regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on the workforce and the Company and our work from home arrangement, while initiating new protocols across all offices under the direction of our COVID-19 task force. We established workplace health and safety standards based on guidance from local public health authorities, and that reflect local business necessities, and differences in laws, culture and employee needs. We also surveyed our employee base and we believe that our employees adopted well to working from home. We are planning to return to the office as the pandemic recedes and safety concerns are abated. 
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation program is designed to attract, reward and retain talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business, contribute to our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We believe that our employees should have a strong work/life balance, develop and grow personally and professionally, and be able to save for their future. We provide employees with industry-competitive compensation and benefits, including retirement savings programs, the opportunity to invest in Dynatrace at a discount through the ESPP, and medical, dental, vision, and life and disability plans. Our benefits vary around the world due to local country regulations and cultural preferences.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that an equitable and inclusive environment comprised of diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results in better and more innovative products, and is important to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. We are focused on building an inclusive culture and sustaining a diverse workforce through a variety of company initiatives, such as training for employees around unconscious bias and other diversity and inclusion-related topics designed to create a culture of belonging. We also provide resources and training to employees to ensure that as we continue to grow, we are hiring people of all types. Additionally, Dynatrace continues to be recognized as an employer of choice clinching awards around the globe in 2020 and 2021. Some notable awards include being named one of the Top 10 Highest-Rated Cloud Companies to Work For by Battery Ventures & Glassdoor, #1 IT company in Austria, #1 Company in Upper Austria and #6 Company overall in Austria ranked by Trend in cooperation with Statista, Kununu, and XING, Top Workplaces USA, BuiltIn Boston’s Best Large Companies to Work For, Detroit Free Press’ Top Workplace list.
