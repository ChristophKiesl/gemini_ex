--------+----------

Introduction
 
We are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this annual report as our initial business combination. We have reviewed a number of opportunities to enter into a business combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.
 
Our founder, Michael Klein, is also the founder and managing partner of M. Klein and Company, which he founded in 2012. M. Klein and Company is a global strategic advisory firm that provides its clients a variety of advice tailored to their objectives. M. Klein and Company has established an entity within the firm, Archimedes Advisors, which will invest in our sponsor and which consists of operating partners (“operating partners”) who will assist Mr. Klein in sourcing potential acquisition targets, and creating long-term value in the business combination for us. M. Klein and Company’s operating partners are comprised of former senior operating executives of leading S&P 500 companies across multiple sectors and industries, including consumer, industrial, materials, energy, mining, chemicals, finance, data, software, enterprise technology, and media.
 
Our executive offices are located at 640 Fifth Avenue, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10019 and our telephone number is (212) 380-7500. Our corporate website address https://iv.churchillcapitalcorp.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this annual report.

Company History
 
In May 2020, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 21,562,500 shares of Class B common stock (our “founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.001 per share. Our Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock, on a one-for-one basis, upon the completion of a business combination. On July 14, 2020, the Company effected a stock dividend of one-third of a share of Class B common stock for each outstanding share of Class B common stock, on July 27, 2020, the Company effected a stock dividend of 0.50 to 1 share of Class B common stock for each outstanding share of Class B common stock and on July 30, 2020, the Company effected a stock dividend of 0.20 to 1 share of Class B common stock for each outstanding share of Class B common stock, resulting in 51,750,000 shares of Class B common stock being issued and outstanding. All share and per-share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the stock dividends. The number of founder shares issued was based on the expectation that the founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares of our determined Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (collectively, our “common stock’) upon completion of the initial public offering (the “IPO”).
 
On August 3, 2020 we completed our IPO of 207,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit (the “units”), generating gross proceeds of $2,070,000,000. Each unit consists of one of the Company’s shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-fifth of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.

Concurrently with the completion of the IPO, our sponsor purchased an aggregate 42,850,000 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per warrant, or $42,850,000 in the aggregate. An aggregate of $2,070,000,000 from the proceeds of the IPO and the private placement warrants was placed in a trust account (the “trust account”) such that the trust account held $2,070,000,000 at the time of closing of the IPO. Each whole private placement warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
 
On September 17, 2020, we announced that, commencing September 18, 2020, holders of the 207,000,000 units sold in the IPO may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock and the warrants included in the units. Those units not separated continued to trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “CCIV.U” and the shares of Class A common stock and warrants that were separated trade under the symbols “CCIV” and “CCIV WS,” respectively.
 
Recent Developments
 
On February 22, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among us, Air Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Churchill (“Merger Sub”), and Atieva, Inc., d/b/a Lucid Motors, an exempted company incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the Cayman Islands (the “Company”).
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the parties thereto will enter into a business combination transaction (the “Business Combination”) by which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company with the Company being the surviving entity in the merger (the “Merger” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Transactions”).
 
The proposed Business Combination is expected to be consummated after the required approval by our stockholders and the Company and the satisfaction of certain other conditions summarized below.
 
Merger Agreement
 
Merger Consideration
 
The aggregate consideration to be paid to the shareholders of the Company will be equal to (a) $11,750,000,000 plus (b) (i) all cash and cash equivalents of the Company and its subsidiaries less (ii) all indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company and its subsidiaries, in each case as of two business days prior to the closing date (the “Equity Value”) and will be paid entirely in shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Churchill in an amount equal to $10.00 per share (the “Merger Consideration”).
 
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of capital stock of the Company (the “Company Shares”) will be cancelled and automatically deemed for all purposes to represent the right to receive, in the aggregate, the Merger Consideration. At the effective time of the Merger, all share incentive plan or similar equity-based compensation plans maintained for employees of the Company will be assumed by Churchill and all outstanding options to purchase Company Shares (each, a “Company Option”) and each restricted stock unit award (“RSU”) with respect to Company Shares (each, a “Company RSU”) will be assumed by Churchill as described below. For purposes of the following paragraph, the “Exchange Ratio” means the Equity Value per share divided by $10.00.
 
At the effective time of the Merger, each Company Option will become an option to purchase shares of Class A common stock (each, an “Assumed Option”), on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting, exercise and expiration provisions) as applied to the Company Option immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, except that (i) the number of shares of Class A common stock subject to such Assumed Option shall equal the product of (x) the number of Company Shares that were subject to the option immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, and (B) the per-share exercise price shall equal the quotient of (1) the exercise price per Company Share at which such option was exercisable immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, divided by (2) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

At the effective time of the Merger, each Company RSU, will be assumed by Churchill and become an RSU with respect to shares of Class A common stock (each, an “Assumed RSU”) on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting provisions) as applied to each Company RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, except that the number of shares of Class A common stock subject to such Assumed RSU Award will be equal the product of (x) the number of Company Shares that were subject to such RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share.
 
Representations and Warranties
 
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of the parties thereto with respect to, among other things, (i) entity organization, formation and authority, (ii) authorization to enter into the Merger Agreement, (iii) capital structure, (iv) consents and approvals, (v) financial statements, (vi) undisclosed liabilities, (vii) real property, (viii) litigation and proceedings, (ix) material contracts, (x) taxes, (xi) title to assets, (xii) absence of changes, (xiii) environmental matters, (xiv) employee matters, (xv) licenses and permits, (xvi) compliance with laws (xvii) intellectual property and IT security,(xviii) governmental authorities and consents, (xix) insurance, and (xx) related party transactions. The representations and warranties of the parties contained in the Merger Agreement will terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the closing of the Transactions.
Covenants
 
The Merger Agreement contains customary covenants of the parties, including, among others, covenants providing for (i) the operation of the parties’ respective businesses prior to consummation of the Transactions, (ii) Churchill and the Company’s efforts to satisfy conditions to consummation of the Transactions, (iii) Churchill and the Company to cease discussions for alternative transactions, (iv) Churchill to prepare and file a registration statement and a proxy statement for the purpose of soliciting proxies from Churchill’s stockholders to vote in favor of certain matters (the “SPAC Stockholder Matters”), including the adoption of the Merger Agreement, approval of the Transactions, amendment and restatement of Churchill’s certificate of incorporation and certain other matters at a special meeting called therefor (the “Special Meeting”), (v) the Company to convene an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders to approve certain matters, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Plan of Merger and approval of the Transactions (the “Company Shareholder Matters”), (vi) the protection of, and access to, confidential information of the parties and (vii) the parties’ efforts to obtain necessary approvals from governmental agencies.
 
Conditions to Closing
 
The consummation of the Transactions is subject to customary closing conditions for special purpose acquisition companies, including, among others: (i) approval by Churchill’s stockholders, (ii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iii) no order, statute, rule or regulation enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions being in force, (iv) Churchill having at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets as of the closing of the Transactions, (v) approval by the Company’s shareholders, (vi) shares of Churchill’s common stock being listed on the New York Stock Exchange or other stock exchange mutually agreed between Churchill and the Company, (vi) the registration statement becoming effective in accordance with the Securities Act and (vii) customary bringdown conditions.

Termination
 
The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time, but not later than the closing of the Transactions, as follows:
 
(i)            by mutual written consent of Churchill and the Company;
 
(ii)           by either Churchill or the Company if the Transactions are not consummated on or before October 22, 2021 (the “Termination Date”), but Churchill’s right to terminate will be automatically extended if any action for specific performance or other equitable relief filed by the Company with respect to the Merger Agreement, the other transaction agreements specified in the Merger Agreement or otherwise regarding the Transactions is commenced or pending on or prior to the Termination Date, provided that the terminating party’s failure to fulfill any of its obligations under the Merger Agreement is not the primary cause of the failure of the closing to occur by such date;
 
(iii)          by either Churchill or the Company if a governmental entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in any case having the effect of permanently enjoining or prohibiting the Merger, which order, decree, judgment, ruling or other action is final and nonappealable;
 
(iv)          by either Churchill or the Company if the other party has breached any of its covenants, agreements, representations or warranties which would result in the failure of certain conditions to be satisfied at the closing and has not cured its breach within thirty days of the notice of an intent to terminate, provided that the terminating party’s failure to fulfill any of its obligations under the Merger Agreement is not the primary cause of the failure of the closing to occur;
 
(v)           by either Churchill or the Company if, at the Special Meeting, the Transactions and the other SPAC Stockholder Matters shall fail to be approved by holders of Churchill’s outstanding shares, provided that Churchill’s right to terminate for failure to obtain such approval shall not be available if, at the time of such termination, SPAC is in breach of certain of its obligations under the Merger Agreement, including with respect to the preparation, filing and mailing of the registration statement and the proxy statement and convening the Special Meeting; or
 
(vi)          by Churchill if the Company shall fail to obtain the Company Shareholder Matters.
 
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the Transactions does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and any related agreements. The Merger Agreement contains representations, warranties and covenants that the respective parties made to each other as of the date of such agreement or other specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations, warranties and covenants were made for purposes of the contract among the respective parties and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating such agreement. The Merger Agreement has been included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Current Report”) to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Churchill, the Company, or any other party to the Merger Agreement or any related agreement. In particular, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, which were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, are subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties (including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts) and are subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that may differ from those applicable to investors and security holders. Investors and security holders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, or any descriptions thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of any party to the Merger Agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Churchill’s public disclosures.
 
A copy of the Merger Agreement is filed with this Annual Report as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto.

Related Agreements
 
Investor Rights Agreement
 
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Churchill entered into an Investor Rights Agreement (the “Investor Rights Agreement”) with Ayar Third Investment Company (“Ayar”), Churchill Sponsor IV LLC (“Churchill Sponsor”) and the other parties named therein. Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, as of the date of the closing of the Transactions, Ayar has the right to nominate five directors to Churchill’s board of directors (the “Board”) and Churchill Sponsor has the right to nominate one director to the Board. Two directors will be independent directors to be nominated by the Company and one director will be the chief executive officer of the combined company. In addition, following the closing of the Transactions, Ayar will have a continuing right to designate directors to the Board, subject to its (and its permitted transferees’) beneficial ownership of Class A common stock as compared to the Class A common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date of each applicable annual or special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (the “Record Date”). If, following the closing of the Transactions, Ayar (or its permitted transferees) beneficially owns: (i) 50% or greater of the shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date, it will have the right to nominate five directors; (ii) less than 50% but greater than or equal to 40% of the shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date, it will have the right to nominate four directors; (iii) less than 40% but greater than or equal to 30% of the shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date, it will have the right to nominate three directors; (iv) less than 30% but greater than or equal to 20% of the shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date, it will have the right to nominate two directors; (v) less than 20% but greater than or equal to 10% of the shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date, it will have the right to nominate one director; and (vi) less than 10% of the shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date, it will not have the right to nominate any directors; provided, that if after the date of the closing of the Transactions the size of the Board is increased or decreased, the number of directors Ayar is entitled to nominate will be increased or decreased in proportion to such increase or decrease in the size of the Board, rounded down to the nearest whole number. Further, for so long as Ayar beneficially owns 20% or greater of the shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date, it will have the right to designate the Chairman of the Board. Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, any material changes to the combined company’s business plan will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board. In addition, pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, certain parties will be entitled to certain registration rights, including, among other things, customary demand, shelf and piggy-back rights, subject to customary cut-back provisions. Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, certain parties will agree not to sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of shares of Class A common stock or warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock they receive in connection with the Transactions or otherwise beneficially own as of the date of the closing of the Transactions for certain time periods specified therein. The foregoing description of the Investor Rights Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Investor Rights Agreement, included as Exhibit 10.16 to this Current Report.
Subscription Agreements
 
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, (a) Churchill entered into certain common stock subscription agreements (the “Subscription Agreements”) with certain investment funds (the “PIPE Investors”) pursuant to which, Churchill has agreed to issue and sell to the PIPE Investors $2.5 billion of Class A common stock (the “PIPE Shares”) in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act at a purchase price of $15 per share (the “PIPE Investment”). Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, the PIPE Investors have agreed to not transfer any PIPE Shares until the later of (i) the effectiveness of the registration statement to be filed following the closing of the Transactions to register the PIPE Shares and (ii) September 1, 2021. The closing of the PIPE Investment is conditioned on all conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement having been satisfied or waived and other customary closing conditions, and the Transactions will be consummated immediately following the closing of the PIPE Investment. The Subscription Agreements will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the termination of the Merger Agreement and (ii) the mutual written agreement of the parties thereto.
 
The Subscription Agreements provide that Churchill is required to file with the SEC, within 30 days after the consummation of the Transactions, a shelf registration statement covering the resale of the PIPE Shares and to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have such registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the filing thereof but no later than the earlier of (i) the 90th day (or 150th day if the SEC notifies Churchill that it will “review” such registration statement) following the closing of the PIPE Investment and (ii) the 10th business day after the date Churchill is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the SEC that such registration statement will not be “reviewed” or will not be subject to further review.

Initial Business Combination
 
The NYSE rules require that an initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if applicable, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount). We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case.
 
We may structure our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which holders (our “public stockholders”) of our Class A common stock sold as part of the units in the IPO (the “public shares”), including our sponsor, officers and directors to the extent our sponsor, officers or directors own public shares, provided that each of their status as a “public stockholder” shall only exist with respect to their public shares, will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our initial business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of our board of directors, which must include a majority of our independent directors to approve our initial business combination (or such other vote as the applicable law or stock exchange rules then in effect may require).
 
Corporate Information
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
7

 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following August 3, 2025, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (collectively, our “common stock”) that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds available for a business combination in the amount of approximately $1,997,550,000 as of December 31, 2020, assuming no redemptions and after payment of up to $72,450,000 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business.
 
Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 

· | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is highly unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
8

 

We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (net of permitted withdrawals), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At completion of the business combination, we will be required to purchase any public shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the trust account as of the closing of the IPO was $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption right will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (the “letter agreement”).
 
Manner of conducting redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either: (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination; or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We currently intend to conduct redemptions pursuant to a stockholder vote unless stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

· | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

· | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration.
 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will count towards this quorum and have agreed to vote any founder shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds and agreements, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination.
 
10

 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
 
Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the IPO, without our prior consent, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the IPO could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or our affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the IPO, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
 
Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against the initial business combination at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that any beneficial owner on whose behalf a redemption right is being exercised must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
11

 

The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until the end of the completion window.
 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have until August 3, 2022, the date that is 24 months from the closing of the IPO, to complete our initial business combination (the period from the closing of the IPO until August 3, 2022, the “completion window”). If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window.
 
Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers and directors acquires public shares after the IPO, it will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the completion window.
 
12

 

Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of permitted withdrawals), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules).
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account and any tax payments or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors included herein. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (1) $10.00 per public share or (2) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of permitted withdrawals, except as to any claims by a third party that executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
13

 

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of permitted withdrawals, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in certain instances. For example, the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or the independent directors may determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors included herein.
 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2020, we had access to approximately $2,070,086,006 in the trust account with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
 
14

 

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the completion window, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of permitted withdrawals and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following July 1, 2021 and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account.
 
As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote.
 
Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of permitted withdrawals and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.”
 
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with our initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above.

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to the IPO that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the completion window or with respect to any other material provisions relating to the rights of holders of our Class A Common Stock or pre-initial business combination business activity, we will provide public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

· | prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either: (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for, against, or abstain from voting on, the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of permitted withdrawals); or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of permitted withdrawals), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination at a duly held stockholders meeting;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | if our initial business combination is not consummated within the completion window, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (1) receive funds from the trust account or (2) vote on any initial business combination.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting.
 
Certain Potential Conflicts of Interest Relating to M. Klein and Company and Our Officers and Directors
 
Our sponsor is an affiliate of M. Klein and Company, LLC (together with its affiliates “M. Klein and Company”). Michael Klein is the founder and managing partner of M. Klein and Company and acts as a strategic advisor to its clients. Mr. Klein has a fiduciary duty to M. Klein and Company. As a result, Mr. Klein may have a duty to offer acquisition opportunities to clients of M. Klein and Company. Mr. Klein will have no duty to offer acquisition opportunities to the Company unless presented to him solely in his capacity as an officer or director of the Company and after he has satisfied his contractual and fiduciary obligations to other parties. As a result, M. Klein and Company’s clients may compete with us for acquisition opportunities in the same industries and sectors as we may target for our initial business combination. If any of them decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within M. Klein and Company, including by Mr. Klein and other persons who may make decisions for the company, may be suitable both for us and for M. Klein and Company or any of its clients, and will be directed initially to such persons rather than to us. None of Mr. Klein, M. Klein and Company or members of our management team who are also employed by M. Klein and Company have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware unless it is offered to them solely in their capacity as a director or officer of the Company and after they have satisfied their contractual and fiduciary obligations to other parties.
 
16

 

In addition, Mr. Klein and M. Klein and Company may sponsor or form other blank check companies similar to ours during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. In particular, M. Klein and Company, Mr. Klein and the Operating Partners as well as out board of directors, have formed and are actively engaged in Churchill Capital Corp II, Churchill Capital Corp V, Churchill Capital Corp VI and Churchill Capital Corp VII, special purpose acquisition corporations that completed their initial public offerings in July 2019, December 2020, February 2021 and February 2021, respectively. Churchill Capital Corp II, Churchill Capital Corp V, Churchill Capital Corp VI and Churchill Capital Corp VII, like us, may pursue initial business combination targets in any businesses or industries and have until July 1, 2021, December 18, 2022, February 17, 2023 and February 17, 2023, respectively, to do so (absent an extension in accordance with their charters). Any such companies, including Churchill Capital Corp II, Churchill Capital Corp V, Churchill Capital Corp VI and Churchill Capital Corp VII may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target. M. Klein and Company, Mr. Klein and the Operating Partners are also actively engaged in AltC Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition corporation that is in the process of completing its initial public offering as of the date of this filing and may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target.
 
In addition, Mr. Taragin, our Chief Financial Officer, is Chief Financial Officer of M. Klein and Company.
 
The potential conflicts described above may limit our ability to enter into a business combination or other transactions. These circumstances could give rise to numerous situations where interests may conflict.
 
Additionally, the engagement of M. Klein and Company, or another affiliate of our sponsor, as our lead financial advisor in connection with our initial business combination may present certain conflicts of interest. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We may engage an affiliate of our sponsor who may be entitled to earn an advisory fee upon the completion of an initial business combination. Its financial interest in the completion of the business combination may influence the advice it provides the Company.”
 
There can be no assurance that these or other conflicts of interest with the potential for adverse effects on the Company and investors will not arise.
 
Limitations on Our Access to Investment Opportunities Sourced by M. Klein and Company
 
M. Klein and Company may compete with us for acquisition opportunities that we may target for our initial business combination. If M. Klein and Company decides to pursue any such opportunity or determines in its sole discretion not to offer such opportunity to us, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within M. Klein and Company or by persons who may make decisions for us may be suitable for both us and for M. Klein and Company may be directed to M. Klein and Company or other third parties rather than to us. M. Klein and Company does not have any fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to our company, including, without limitation, to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware.
 
Our management team, in their other endeavors (including any affiliation they may have with M. Klein and Company), may choose or be required to present potential business combinations or other transactions to M. Klein and Company or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us. Please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Certain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity or other transaction should be presented.”

Sponsor Indemnity
 
Our sponsor, an affiliate of M. Klein and Company, has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case, net of permitted withdrawals, except as to any claims by a third party that executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not any such waiver is enforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have not independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. We believe the likelihood of our sponsor having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account.
Additional Information Regarding Our Proposed Initial Business Combination
 
We will file a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC, which includes a proxy statement and a prospectus, and we will file other documents regarding the Transactions. The definitive proxy statement/prospectus will also be sent to our stockholders and Lucid’s stockholders, seeking any required stockholder approvals. We urge you to carefully read the entire registration statement and proxy statement/prospectus and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, including any amendments or supplements to these documents, because they contain important information about the proposed transactions, including detailed descriptions of the Transactions and a discussion of historical information and risks relating to the Transactions. The documents filed by us with the SEC may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume the closing of the Transactions described above.
 
Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC’s internet site (http://www.sec.gov) contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.
 
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 640 Fifth Avenue, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10019. The cost for this space is included in the $50,000 per month fee that we are paying an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services.
Employees
 
We currently have two officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains such reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accounting firm.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or international financial reporting standards as promulgated by the international accounting standards board (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the completion window. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.

We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer an emerging growth company will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following August 3, 2025, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
On March 3, 2021, Richard Hofman, a purported stockholder of us, filed a complaint, individually and on behalf of other of our stockholders, in the Superior Court of the State of California against us, Lucid, and other unnamed defendants. The complaint alleges claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and false advertising and unfair business practices in connection with allegedly false and misleading statements and omissions in our public filings, concerning the proposed merger between us and Lucid. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, as well as compensatory and punitive damages. On March 8, 2021, plaintiff filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which the Company opposed and the court denied on March 10, 2021.
