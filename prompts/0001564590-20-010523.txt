Item 1. Business. 
Company Overview 
 We are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing products intended to transform the way calcified cardiovascular disease is treated. We aim to establish a new standard of care for medical device treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (“atherosclerosis”) through our differentiated and proprietary local delivery of sonic pressure waves for the treatment of calcified plaque, which we refer to as intravascular lithotripsy (“IVL”). Our IVL system (our “IVL System”), which leverages our IVL technology (our “IVL Technology”), is a minimally invasive, easy-to-use and safe way to significantly improve patient outcomes. 
 Our Shockwave M5 IVL catheter (“M5 catheter”) was CE-Marked in April 2018 and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in July 2018 for use in our IVL System for the treatment of peripheral artery disease (“PAD”). 
 Our Shockwave C2 IVL catheter (“C2 catheter”), which we are currently marketing in Europe, was CE-Marked in June 2018 for use in our IVL System for the treatment of coronary artery disease (“CAD”). In August 2019, we received the Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA for our C2 catheters using our IVL System for the treatment of CAD. 
 The second version of our Shockwave S4 IVL catheter (“S4 catheter”) was cleared by the FDA in August 2019. We commenced a full commercial launch of our S4 catheter in the second half of 2019 in select approved geographies. 
 We also have ongoing clinical programs across several products and indications, which, if successful, will allow us to expand commercialization of our products into new geographies and indications. Importantly, we are undertaking ongoing clinical trials of our C2 catheter intended to support a pre-market application (“PMA”) in the United States and a Shonin submission in Japan for the treatment of CAD. In October 2018, we received staged Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) approval for our DISRUPT CAD III global study, which began enrollment in 2019. This study is designed to support U.S. PMA approval for our C2 catheters. We anticipate having final data from these ongoing clinical trials intended to support a U.S. launch of our C2 catheter in the first half of 2021 and a Japan launch in the first half of 2022. 
 The Opportunity 
 Atherosclerosis is a common disease of aging in which arteries become narrowed (“stenotic”) and the supply of oxygenated blood to the affected organ is reduced by the progressive growth of plaque. Atherosclerotic plaque is comprised of fibrous tissue, lipids (fat) and, when it progresses, calcium. This calcium is present both deep within the walls of the artery (“deep” or “medial” calcium) and close to the inner surface of the artery (“superficial” or “intimal” calcium). 
 The first two indications we are targeting with our IVL System are occlusive PAD, the narrowing or blockage of vessels that carry blood from the heart to the extremities, and CAD, the narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. In the future, we see significant opportunity in the potential treatment of aortic stenosis (“AS”), a condition in which the heart’s aortic valve becomes increasingly calcified with age, causing it to narrow and obstruct blood flow from the heart. 
 The PAD population in the United States has been estimated to be at least eight million people, according to the National Institutes of Health. The global PAD device market size for treatment of occlusive disease is estimated at approximately $2.9 billion and is expected to grow approximately 3% annually due to the fundamental drivers of an aging population and increasing prevalence of diabetes. The “calcium” segment of the PAD market represents a significant percentage of the market, with 50% or more of the population having moderate-to-severe calcium in their vessels, according to our estimates. Current technologies are often not able to safely and effectively treat heavily calcified vessels. Accordingly, we believe our IVL System to treat PAD has a total addressable market opportunity of over $1.7 billion. 
 The global device market in coronary intervention for CAD is estimated to be nearly $10 billion, according to Millennium Research Group, Inc. (“MRG”). The most common treatment for patients is percutaneous coronary intervention (“PCI”). This involves a suite of devices to facilitate successful angioplasty and stenting, the most commonly used device being drug-eluting stents (“DES”). Moreover, there are nearly four million PCI procedures performed globally every year, and the number of PCI procedures is growing at a rate of more than 5% annually. We believe our IVL System can help grow this market through the improved treatment of patients undergoing PCI in whom the currently available solutions pose a higher degree of clinical risk, as well as through increased adoption of IVL by cardiologists compared to currently available 
 4

plaque modification devices. A study published in the American Journal of Cardiology in 2014 demonstrated that more than 30% of patients undergoing PCI have calcified lesions and this percentage is growing. Minimizing complications is particularly important in the coronary vessels, but current plaque modification devices carry meaningful safety risks and are inherently challenging to use, which is why these devices are used very sparingly for PCI procedures in patients with calcified coronary disease. Despite significant under-penetration of the market, these devices still represented a market of nearly $100 million in 2018 within the United States alone, according to MRG; we believe this market is significantly larger globally. Due to the increasing prevalence of calcified cardiovascular disease, the market growth for plaque modification devices exceeds that of PCI procedure growth. We believe the safety, ease of use and efficient impact on calcium of our IVL System will result in rapid adoption and market expansion in markets where our C2 catheter is introduced. We believe there is an over $2 billion total addressable market opportunity for our IVL System to treat CAD. 
 The global market for aortic valve replacement (“AVR”), the main treatment for AS, is growing rapidly, and is dominated by the emergence of transcatheter AVR (“TAVR”) devices. TAVR has rapidly developed into a multibillion-dollar market globally. According to an article published in the Journal of Thoracic Disease in 2017, the global market for TAVR is over 125,000 procedures performed worldwide in 2018 and is expected to grow to nearly 300,000 by 2025. We believe our IVL System may be able to improve the treatment of AS among patients in whom currently available solutions are inadequate. We are currently developing an IVL catheter which we believe can safely and effectively treat patients with AS. If successful, this represents a potential total addressable market of over $3 billion for our IVL System to treat AS. 
 Current Challenges 
 The primary approaches to treat vascular disease are angioplasty balloons (“balloons”), drug-coated balloons (“DCB”), bare metal stents and DES. These devices all work by using pressurized balloons to expand the diseased blood vessels. Calcified plaque creates challenges for these therapies in achieving optimal outcomes in treating PAD and CAD because the calcified vessels fail to expand under safe pressures. This, in turn, can lead to acute failure, damage to the blood vessel, which increases the rate of restenosis (re-occlusion of the vessel following endovascular treatment) or complications requiring adjunctive tools, future re-interventions or conversion to bypass surgery. These complications are significantly increased when treating calcified cardiovascular disease and include dissections, embolization, restenosis, vessel perforations and vessel recoil. 
 Plaque modification devices (including atherectomy and specialty balloons) have enhanced the treatment of some moderately calcified cardiovascular lesions by improving the ability of stent and balloon therapies to effectively expand in the vessel. Atherectomy devices are designed to break or remove superficial calcium by cutting or sanding the calcium in order to improve vessel expansion. Specialty balloon devices incorporate metallic elements like wires and cutting blades onto standard angioplasty balloons; these devices are intended to make discreet cuts in the plaque and surrounding tissue in order to improve vessel expansion. Despite improvements in plaque modification devices, significant limitations remain, including being difficult to use and creating complications and inconsistent efficacy. Further, because medial calcium is encased in the vessel wall, the existing plaque modification devices are unable to impact medial calcium without damaging the vessel. Combined, these limitations decrease the utilization of plaque modification devices for treating calcified cardiovascular disease, thereby reducing the clinical benefit of angioplasty and stent therapies compared to their use in non-calcified anatomies. 
 Calcified iliac and femoral arteries can hinder the delivery of large endovascular devices for other catheter-based procedures, including those that treat aortic aneurysms (endovascular aneurysm repair and thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair procedures), severe aortic stenosis treated with TAVR and cardiac support devices for high-risk PCI (e.g., Abiomed’s Impella). The standard practice for these procedures is to gain vascular access in the femoral artery and insert large diameter sheaths that facilitate the delivery of the treatment devices to the aorta or the heart. However, when significant calcium is present in these arteries, it can prevent delivery of the devices, and thus may require more invasive treatments, increase complications or prevent the device from being used altogether. For example, in up to 20% of patients, the transfemoral approach through the iliac and femoral arteries is not viable for TAVR delivery or creates risk of vessel trauma due to the extent of vascular calcification, according to a 2018 study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

Our Solution 
 We have adapted the use of lithotripsy to the cardiovascular field with the aim of creating what we believe can become the safest, most effective means of addressing the growing challenge of cardiovascular calcification. Lithotripsy has been used to successfully treat kidney stones (deposits of hardened calcium) for over 30 years. By integrating lithotripsy into a device that resembles a standard balloon catheter, physicians can prepare, deliver and treat calcified lesions using a familiar form factor, without disruption to their standard procedural workflow. Our differentiated IVL System works by delivering shockwaves through the entire depth of the artery wall, modifying calcium in the medial layer of the artery, not just in the intimal layer. The shockwaves crack this calcium and enable the stenotic artery to expand at low pressures, thereby minimizing complications inherent to traditional balloon dilations, such as dissections or tears. Preparing the vessel with IVL facilitates optimal outcomes with other therapies, including stents and drug-eluting technologies. Using IVL also avoids complications associated with atherectomy devices such as dissection, perforation and embolism. When followed by an anti-proliferative therapy such as a DCB or DES, the micro-fractures may enable better drug penetration into the arterial wall and improve drug uptake, thereby improving the effectiveness of the combination treatment. 
Our IVL System 
 
 (Left) Our IVL System consisting of a generator, connector cable and IVL catheter. (Right) Our IVL System delivering lithotripsy directly to a calcified vessel
 
Our IVL System includes a generator, connector cable and a variety of IVL catheters designed to treat PAD and CAD. Our IVL System employs our IVL Technology to crack calcium through short, microsecond bursts of sonic pressure waves, which are generated within the IVL catheter, travel through the vessel and crack calcium with an effective pressure of up to 50 atmospheres (“atm”) (a unit of pressure) without harming the soft tissue. Our IVL catheters utilize multiple lithotripsy emitters that are integrated into a standard, semi-compliant balloon-catheter platform. The IVL catheter is advanced to the target lesion and the integrated balloon is inflated with fluid at a low pressure to make contact with the arterial wall. IVL is then activated through the generator with the touch of a button, creating a small bubble within the catheter balloon which rapidly expands and collapses. The rapid expansion and collapse of the bubble creates sonic pressure waves that travel through the vessel and crack the calcium, allowing the blood vessel to expand under low static pressure. 
 We believe there is a significant opportunity to apply our IVL Technology as a platform to treat a wide array of indications throughout the cardiovascular system. Ultimately, our plan is to have a family of IVL catheters that can treat calcium-related diseases across a wide variety of vasculatures and structures.

Our Products and Ongoing Development
 The interchangeability of specific catheters enables delivery of IVL therapy of diseased vasculature throughout the body. Our IVL catheters are cleared or approved for use in a number of geographies. Development programs are underway to expand indications and geographies:

• | M5 catheters (“medium” vessel, five-emitters): for treating above-the-knee PAD in the United States and internationally.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | C2 catheters (coronary arteries, two-emitters): for treating CAD in select international markets. We received IDE approval to conduct a pivotal global study, which is intended to support U.S. FDA and Japanese Shonin approval of the device. We commenced enrollment of the study in early 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | S4 catheters (“small” vessel, four-emitters): for treating PAD Below-the-Knee (“BTK”) in the United States, Europe and other select international markets. We have 510(k) clearance and CE Mark and we are currently engaged in a limited market evaluation of the product to test its performance in the heavily calcified and challenging BTK environment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our IVL catheters resemble in form a standard balloon angioplasty catheter, the device most commonly used by interventionalists. This familiarity makes our IVL System easy to learn, adopt and use on a day-to-day basis.
 A development program and initial clinical work are also currently underway to explore the ability of our IVL Technology to directly treat calcified aortic valves to safely reduce the symptoms of and potentially delay or negate valve replacement treatment for AS.
 Since inception, we have focused on generating clinical data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our IVL Technology. These initial studies have consistently delivered low rates of complications regardless of which vessel was being studied. In addition to gaining regulatory approvals or clearances, the data from our clinical studies strengthen our ability to drive adoption of IVL Technology across multiple therapies in existing and new market segments. Our past studies have demonstrated that our IVL Technology reduces residual stenosis and vascular complications in infrapopliteal and femoropopliteal PAD, with outstanding durability and sustained improvement in functional outcome in 115 patients. Our past studies have also guided optimal IVL procedure technique and informed the design of our IVL System and future products in development. In the treatment of CAD, our past studies have demonstrated both safety and effectiveness of our IVL System in heavily calcified coronary lesions prior to stenting in 180 patients. Feasibility studies have shown the potential of our transcatheter aortic valve lithotripsy system (our “TAVL System”) to safely improve the aortic valve area and reduce transvalvular gradients in AS. We are currently enrolling patients in multiple studies to support applications for and clearances in a variety of indications and geographies, as well as a randomized trial to assess the combination of IVL with DCB for treating PAD.
 We market our IVL System to hospitals whose interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists treat patients with PAD and CAD. We have dedicated meaningful resources to establish direct sales capability in the United States, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, which we have complemented with distributors covering more than 35 countries. We are actively expanding our international field presence through new distributors, additional sales and clinical personnel, and are adding new U.S. sales territories.
 For the treatment of CAD, our C2 catheter has a CE Mark that indicates its use in calcified, stenotic de novo coronary arteries prior to stenting. For the treatment of PAD, our M5 and S4 catheters have a CE Mark and have FDA clearances that indicate their use in calcified, stenotic peripheral arteries in patients who are candidates for percutaneous therapy. Our products are not indicated for the treatment of cerebrovascular or carotid arteries; our M5 and S4 catheters are not indicated for the treatment of coronary arteries.
 While we believe that, from a technological or medical perspective, there are no material disadvantages to the use of our products in comparison to other commercially available alternative products, our products are relatively new, we currently have limited commercialization, sales and marketing experience and our products compete against alternative products that are well-established and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Many of our competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and resources than we have. Our success will depend in part on our ability to increase adoption of our products, expand existing relationships with our customers, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our planned or future products, maintain existing reimbursement and obtain reimbursement where it does not currently exist, and develop new products or add new features to our existing products.

Research and Development
 We invest in research and development efforts that advance our IVL Technology with the goal to expand and improve upon our existing product offerings. Our research and development expenses totaled $22.7 million and $32.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
 We believe our ability to rapidly develop innovative products is attributable to the dynamic product innovation process that we have implemented, the versatility and leveragability of our core technology and the management philosophy behind that process. We have recruited and retained engineers and scientists with significant experience in the development of medical devices. We have a pipeline of products in various stages of development that are expected to provide additional commercial opportunities. Our research and development efforts are based at our facility in Santa Clara, California.
 Manufacturing
 We completed the move of our production of our IVL catheters from our prior Fremont, California facility to our facilities in Santa Clara, California in the second half of 2019. We stock inventory of raw materials, components and finished goods at our facilities in Santa Clara and finished products with our direct sales representatives, who travel to our hospital customers’ locations as part of their sales efforts. Our electronics (i.e., our generators and connector cables) are produced by original equipment manufacturing partners using our design specifications. We rely on a single or limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials and components, and we generally have no long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers, as we order on a purchase order basis. In the United States, we generally ship our IVL products from Santa Clara to our hospital customers in the United States on a consignment basis, but also may sell our IVL products directly to our hospital customers through our direct sales representatives, who deliver such products to hospital customers in the field. Internationally, we ship our IVL products from Santa Clara to either our third-party logistic provider located in the Netherlands who then ships directly to hospital customers and distributors pursuant to purchase orders or from Santa Clara directly to hospital customers and distributors pursuant to purchase orders. We also ship to some customers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland on a consignment basis from our third-party logistic provider located in the Netherlands. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 103 operations and manufacturing employees.

Our rigorous quality control management programs have earned us a number of quality-related manufacturing designations. Our manufacturing facilities are EN ISO 13485 compliant with ISO 13485:2016 edition certification achieved in 2017. In 2014, we achieved compliance with the applicable standards set forth in the European Union’s Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) (the “MDD”). We use annual internal audits, combined with external audits by regulatory agencies, to help ensure strong quality control practices. An internal, on-going staff training and education program contributes to our quality assurance program and training is documented and considered part of the employee evaluation process.
 Sales & Marketing
 We market our products to hospitals whose interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists treat patients with PAD and CAD. We have dedicated meaningful resources to establish a direct sales capability in the United States, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, which we have complemented with distributors covering 35 countries. We are actively expanding our international field presence through new distributors, additional sales and clinical personnel, and are adding new U.S. sales territories. We have the CE Mark in Europe and the 510(k) clearance in the United States for our IVL System using our peripheral catheters (our M5 catheters and S4 catheters) and CE Mark in Europe for our IVL System using our C2 catheter.
 Our sales representatives and sales managers generally have substantial and applicable medical device experience, specifically in the vascular space and market our products directly to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists who treat patients with PAD and CAD. We are focused on developing strong relationships with our physician and hospital customers in order to educate them on the use and benefits of our products. Similarly, our marketing team has a significant amount of domain expertise and a strong track record of success. Our global sales and marketing team totaled 83 professionals as of December 31, 2019.
 In the United States, our IVL generators and connector cables are typically provided, on loan, to our hospital customers at no charge, while our disposable IVL catheters are provided on a consignment basis whereby title to such catheters passes to the hospital once they are used in a clinical procedure. Following such use, we charge the hospital a predetermined set fee for each IVL catheter, which fee may be determined based on the hospital’s overall use of our IVL catheters.
 In addition to our direct sales organizations, we sell to distributors in certain geographies outside the United States where we have determined that selling through third party distributors is the best way to optimize our opportunities and resources. We select distribution partners who have deep experience in our markets, have strong customer relationships and have a demonstrated track record of launching innovative products.
 Our IVL System is simple, intuitive, easy to install and easy to use. This provides value to our customers, but also makes our sales model a source of competitive advantage. Lower service burden means we can develop a cost-efficient sales model by optimizing a mix of clinical specialists and salespeople. Moreover, our vascular IVL catheters have similar call points, meaning we can further leverage our field sales team.
 Reimbursement
 In the U.S., our products are generally purchased by hospitals, which in turn normally bill various third-party payors, including government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurance plans, for the healthcare services required to treat each patient. The applicable third-party payors determine whether to provide coverage for a particular procedure or product, and, if so, the amount for which the provider will be reimbursed for treatment. 
 Outside the U.S., reimbursement levels vary significantly by country, and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both.
 Our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and the level of reimbursement for procedures performed using our products under healthcare payment systems in the markets where we sell and distribute our products. We cannot assure you that government or private payors will continue to cover and reimburse the procedures performed using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will continue to be adequate.
 9

In addition, we expect that we will continue to see pressure globally by third-party payors to manage the cost of healthcare. Cost management may come in a variety of forms, including rules and practices of third-party payors, judicial decisions, laws and regulations, group purchasing and managed care organizations, and medical device reimbursement policies. Cost management could potentially limit the amount which healthcare providers may be willing to pay for our products and impact demand for our products, product pricing, reimbursement and usage, and which, in turn, may adversely affect our product sales and results of operations.
 Competition
 The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We compete or plan to compete with manufacturers and distributors of cardiovascular medical devices. Our most notable competitors in the highly competitive cardiovascular field include Boston Scientific Corporation, Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., Medtronic plc and Philips N.V. Many of these competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and resources than we have. As a consequence, they are able to spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. We also compete with smaller medical device companies that have single products or a limited range of products. Some of our competitors have:

• | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


• | broader or deeper relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | more established distribution networks;
--+----------------------------------------


• | additional lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent prosecution.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that our proprietary IVL Technology, our focus on calcified cardiovascular disease and our organizational culture and strategy, will be important factors in our future success. We compete primarily on the basis that our products are designed to treat patients with calcified cardiovascular disease safely, easily and effectively, with improved outcomes and procedural cost savings. Our continued success depends on our ability to:
  
• | develop innovative, proprietary products that can cost-effectively address significant clinical needs in a manner that is safe and effective for patients and easy to use for physicians;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continue to innovate and develop scientifically advanced technology;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain and maintain regulatory clearances or approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | demonstrate efficacy in our sponsored and third-party clinical trials and studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement for procedures using our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | apply technology across product lines and markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | attract and retain skilled research and development and sales personnel; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cost-effectively manufacture and successfully market and sell products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect the intellectual property rights that we consider important to our business. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 10

We seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information. However, trade secrets and proprietary information can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets and proprietary information, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets and proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
 As of December 31, 2019, we owned 39 issued U.S. patents and 17 issued foreign patents, 17 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and 18 pending foreign patent applications (including four Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) applications). This portfolio includes 17 issued U.S. patents, 24 issued foreign patents, 6 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and 8 pending foreign patent applications (including one PCT application) relating to our current IVL Technology. 
 U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,642,673, 8,956,371 and 8,728,091, which are three of our issued U.S. patents relating to our current IVL Technology, are the subject of IPR proceedings filed by Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., one of our competitors. For more information regarding these proceedings, please see the section titled “Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.”
 Our issued patents, and any patents granted from any pending applications, are expected to expire between 2029 and 2039, without taking into account potential patent term extensions or adjustments. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. We cannot be sure that any patent applications we have filed, or may file in the future, will result in issued patents.  We can give no assurance that any patents that have been issued or may be issued in the future will protect our current or future products, will provide us with any competitive advantage, and will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.
 For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, including the above referenced IPRs, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Regulation
 Our products are medical devices subject to extensive laws, rules regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in each of the markets in which we sell or distribute our products. These laws, rules and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export, pricing and discounts, post-marketing surveillance and interactions with healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject one or more of our products or us to a variety of sanctions, such as loss of product approvals/clearances/certifications, issuance of warning letters, import detentions, and civil monetary penalties or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution.
United States
 FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements. Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a prior 510(k) clearance, unless it is exempt, or a premarket approval (“PMA”) from the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject to the general controls of the U.S. federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”), such as provisions that relate to adulteration; misbranding; registration and listing; notification, including repair, replacement, or refund; records and reports; and good manufacturing practices. Most Class I devices are classified as exempt from premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, and therefore may be commercially distributed without obtaining 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Class II devices are subject to both general controls and special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Special controls include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries, and guidance documents. A manufacturer may be required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute some Class II devices. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or 
 11

devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. A Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA application. However, there are some Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet called for a PMA. For these devices, the manufacturer must submit a premarket notification and obtain 510(k) clearance in order to commercially distribute these devices. The FDA can also impose sales, marketing or other restrictions on devices in order to assure that they are used in a safe and effective manner.
 510(k) Clearance Pathway. When a 510(k) clearance is required, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared and legally marketed 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. By regulation, a premarket notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 90 days before we intend to market a device, and we must receive 510(k) clearance from the FDA before we actually market the device. The Medical Device User Fee Amendments (“MDUFA”) performance goals for a traditional 510(k) clearance is 90 days. As a practical matter, however, clearance often takes longer, because the review clock is paused by the FDA to allow time to resolve any questions the FDA may have on the 510(k). To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or different technological characteristics and the information in the premarket notification demonstrates that the device is equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device or use, the FDA will place the device into Class III.
 There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional, special and abbreviated. Special 510(k)s are typically for devices that are modified and the results of change evaluation can be sufficiently reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format. Abbreviated 510(k)s are for devices that conform to special controls for the device type or to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review, and the FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt.
 Premarket Approval Pathway. A PMA application under section 515 of the FD&C Act must be submitted to the FDA for Class III devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The PMA application process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA is based on a determination by FDA that the PMA application contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to assure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). 
 After a PMA application is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and thus whether the FDA will file the application for review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendations are important to the FDA’s overall decision making process. In addition, the FDA may conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”). The FDA also may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with the FDA’s regulations.
 Upon completion of the PMA application review, the FDA may: (i) approve the PMA which authorizes commercial marketing with specific prescribing information for one or more indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought; (ii) issue an approvable letter which indicates the FDA’s belief that the PMA application is approvable and states what additional information the FDA requires, or the post-approval commitments that must be agreed to prior to approval; (iii) issue a not approvable letter which outlines steps required for approval, but which are typically more onerous than those in an approvable letter, and may require additional clinical trials that are often expensive and time consuming and can delay approval for months or even years; or (iv) deny the application. If the FDA issues an approvable or not approvable letter, the applicant has 180 days to respond, after which the FDA’s review clock is reset.
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. In the United States, for significant risk devices, these trials require submission of an application for an IDE to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients at specified study sites. During the trial, the sponsor must comply with the 
 12

FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites. An IRB is an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor medical research involving subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety and welfare of human research subjects. A nonsignificant risk device does not require FDA approval of an IDE; however, the clinical trial must still be conducted in compliance with various requirements of FDA’s IDE regulations and be approved by an IRB at the clinical trials sites. We, the FDA or the IRB at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may withdraw approval of a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits or a failure to comply with FDA or IRB requirements. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval or clearance of the product. 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of devices are required to register with clinicaltrials.gov, a public database of clinical trial information. Information related to the device, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration.
 Ongoing Regulation by the FDA. Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 
 
 
• | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations and the FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if their device malfunctioned and the device or a similar device marketed by the manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post market surveillance regulations, which apply to certain Class II or Class III devices when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) or possibly a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the FDA may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA. The FDA could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or a PMA is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines and penalties.
 Some changes to an approved PMA device, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new PMA application or PMA supplement, as appropriate, before the change can be implemented. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA application, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the device covered by the original PMA. The FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing PMA supplements as it does in reviewing original PMA applications.
 13

FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services (“CDHS”) requires us to register as a medical device manufacturer within the state. Because of this, the FDA and the CDHS inspect us on a routine basis for compliance with the QSR. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. We have undergone and expect to continue to undergo regular QSR inspections in connection with the manufacture of our products at our facilities. Further, the FDA requires us to comply with various FDA regulations regarding labeling. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:
 

 
• | warning or untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer notifications, voluntary or mandatory recall or seizure of our products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delay in processing submissions or applications for new products or modifications to existing products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing approvals/clearances that have already been granted; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

 
Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our products under development.
 Anti-Kickback Statute.  The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”) prohibits, subject to certain safe harbors set forth in the Anti-Kickback Statute, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, or for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term “remuneration” expressly includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value.  Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (“Affordable Care Act”), to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act which is discussed below. Penalties for violations of the anti-kickback statute include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. Various states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state laws may be broader in scope in that some of these state laws extend to all payors and may not contain safe harbors. In addition, many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have similar laws and regulations.
 Federal Civil False Claims Act. The U.S. federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from or approval by, the federal government. Suits filed under the federal civil False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a case brought under the federal civil False Claim Act. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have adopted laws similar to the federal civil False Claims Act, and many of these state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal government.
 14

Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute.  The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 Sunshine Act. The Affordable Care Act also included a provision, commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act, which requires that any manufacturer of a covered device that provides payment or other transfer of value to a physician or teaching hospital, or to a third party at the request of a physician or teaching hospital, must submit to CMS information about the payment or other transfer of value annually, with the reported information to be made public on a searchable website. Similar laws have been enacted in foreign jurisdictions, including France.
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. In addition, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information.
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included an expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”). Among other things, HITECH created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
 We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws, and regulations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory, and manufacturing practices.
 
International
 General.  International sales of medical devices are subject to a variety of foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to be complex and evolving, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products, and require extensive compliance and monitoring obligations in the countries where we sell or distribute our products.  In addition, our international operations, distribution and sales require us to comply with: the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions; U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and custom laws, as well as foreign tax laws; employment, immigration and labor laws; local intellectual property laws, which may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. law; and privacy laws such as the European General Data Protection Regulation. 
 European Union.  The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices.  Our products are regulated in the European Union as medical devices per the MDD. Conformity with the MDD is indicated by the CE mark, which is issued by the applicable Notified Body following the successful satisfaction of a variety of requirements, which depend on the class of the product, but normally involve a combination of: (a) submission of a design dossier; (b) self-assessment by the manufacturer; (c) a third-party assessment, which generally consists of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and manufacturing site or evidence of current, valid QMS certificate from a recognized Notified Body evidencing compliance with ISO 13485; and (d) review of the design dossier, which may include safety and technical information, by the Notified Body. The CE mark is contingent upon continued compliance with the applicable regulations, including compliance with ISO 13485 and applicable vigilance and post-market surveillance.
 15

The new European Union Medical Devices Regulation (the “MDR”), which was published in May 2017 with a transition period of three years, replaces the MDD and will expand and modify the pre-market and post-market obligations of the MDD. Starting May 2020, the new MDR will apply and no new applications under the previous directives will be permitted. We are in the process of updating our technical documentation and other quality management system processes to meet the new MDR requirements. Under the new MDR requirements, CE certificates issued under the MDD prior to May 2020 will remain valid in accordance with their term, beyond the expiration of the transition period, however certain limitations set forth in the MDR, such as the need to use classifications that are different from the previous directives, would apply. We do not expect such limitations to have any material impact on our ability to supply our products to the countries covered by the MDR.
 Regulatory Inspections
 We are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory entities, such as a European Notified Body, related to the regulatory requirements that apply to medical devices designed and manufactured, and clinical trials sponsored, by us. When the FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors will identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form of a notice of inspectional observations, or Form FDA 483. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations or deficiencies from the FDA following an inspection, we would be required to respond in writing, and would be required to undertake corrective and/or preventive or other actions in order to address the FDA’s or other regulators’ concerns. Failure to address the FDA’s concerns may result in the issuance of a warning letter or other enforcement or administrative actions.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, we had 284 full-time employees worldwide. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our employee relations are good.
 Legal Proceedings
 We may be subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We have received, and may from time to time receive, letters from third parties alleging patent infringement, violation of employment practices or trademark infringement, and we may in the future participate in litigation to defend ourselves. We cannot predict the results of any such disputes, and despite the potential outcomes, the existence thereof may have an adverse material impact on us due to diversion of management time and attention as well as the financial costs related to resolving such disputes. For information with respect to Legal Proceedings, see Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of: the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer (this means the market value of shares of our common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year); the issuance, in any three-year period, by us of more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering. Any reference herein to “emerging growth company” has the meaning ascribed to it in the JOBS Act.
 16

An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:
 
 
• | being permitted to present only two years of audited consolidated financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) for an IPO of common equity securities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
