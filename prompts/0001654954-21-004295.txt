  ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel immuno-oncology products based off our proprietary Tri-specific Killer Engager (TriKE™) fusion protein immune cell engager technology platform. Our TriKE platform generate proprietary therapeutics designed to harness and enhance the cancer killing abilities of a patient’s own natural killer cells, or NK cells. Once bound to an NK cell, our moieties are designed to enhance the NK cell, and precisely direct it to one or more specifically-targeted proteins expressed on a specific type of cancer cell or virus infected cell, ultimately resulting in the targeted cell’s death. TriKE can be designed to target any number of tumor antigens on hematologic malignancies, sarcomas or solid tumors and do not require patient-specific customization.
  
 We are using our TriKE platform with the intent to bring to market immuno-oncology products that can treat a range of hematologic malignancies, sarcoma and solid tumors. The platform is scalable, and we are putting processes in place to be able to produce IND-ready moieties in a timely manner after a specific TriKE conceptual design. After conducting market and competitive research, specific moieties can then be advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with larger companies. We are also evaluating, in conjunction with our Scientific Advisory Board, additional moieties designed to target different tumor antigens. We believe our TriKE may have the ability, if approved for marketing, to be used as a monotherapy, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics, be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy and potentially overcome certain limitations of current chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR-T, therapy.
  
 We are also using our TriKE platform to develop therapeutics useful for the treatment of infectious disease such as for the treatment of patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). While the use of anti-retroviral drugs has substantially improved the health and increased the longevity of individuals infected with HIV, these drugs are designed to suppress virus replication to help modulate progression to AIDS and to limit further transmission of the virus. Despite the use of anti-retroviral drugs, infected individuals retain reservoirs of latent HIV-infected cells that, upon cessation of anti-retroviral drug therapy, can reactivate and re-establish an active HIV infection. For a curative therapy, destruction of these latent HIV infected cells must take place. The HIV-TriKE contains the antigen binding fragment (Fab) from a broadly-neutralizing antibody targeting the HIV-Env protein. The HIV-TriKE is designed to target HIV while redirecting NK cell killing specifically to actively replicating HIV infected cells. The HIV-TriKE induced NK cell proliferation, and demonstrated the ability in vitro to reactivate and kill HIV-infected T-cells. These findings indicate a potential role for the HIV-TriKE in the reactivation and elimination of the latently infected HIV reservoir cells by harnessing the NK cell’s ability to mediate the antibody-directed cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
  
 Our initial work has been conducted in collaboration with the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota under a program led by Dr. Jeffrey Miller, the Deputy Director. Dr. Miller is a recognized leader in the field of NK cell and IL-15 biology and their therapeutic potential. We have exclusive rights to the TriKE platform and are generating additional intellectual prop

  Tri-specific Killer Engagers (TriKEs)
  
 The generation of chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, expressing T cells from monoclonal antibodies has represented an important step forward in cancer therapy. These therapies involve the genetic engineering of T cells to express either CARs, or T cell receptors, or TCRs, and are designed such that the modified T cells can recognize and destroy cancer cells. While a great deal of interest has recently been placed upon chimeric antigen receptor T, or CAR-T, therapy, it has certain limitations for broad potential applicability because it can require an individual approach that is expensive and time consuming, and may be difficult to apply on a large scale. NK cells represent an important immunotherapeutic target as they are involved in tumor immune-surveillance, can mediate antibody- dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), contain pre-made granules with perforin and granzyme B and can quickly secrete inflammatory cytokines, and unlike T cells they do not require antigen priming and can kill cells in the absence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation of antigens. We believe there is a continued medical need for targeted immuno-oncology therapies that can have the potential to be dosed in a patient-friendly outpatient setting, can be used on a stand-alone basis, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics or be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy. We believe our TriKE constructs have this potential and therefore we have generated, and intend to continue to generate, a pipeline of product candidates to be advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with larger companies.
  
  GTB-3550 TriKE™ and GTB-3550 TriKE™ Phase I/II Clinical Trial
  
  GTB-3550 is the Company's first TriKE™ product candidate which is a single-chain, tri-specific recombinant fusion protein construct composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD16 and anti-CD33 antibodies and a modified form of IL-15. The GTB-3550 Phase I/II clinical trial for treatment of patients with CD33-expressing, high risk myelodysplastic syndromes, refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia or advanced systemic mastocytosis opened for patient enrollment September 2019. The clinical trial is being conducted at the University of Minnesota’s Masonic Cancer Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota under the direction of Dr. Erica Warlick. Additional clinical trial sites planned as we progress to the Phase II expansion part of the clinical trial.
  
 NK cells represent an important immunotherapeutic target as they are involved in tumor immune-surveillance, can mediate antibody- dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), contain pre-made granules with perforin and granzyme B and can quickly secrete inflammatory cytokines, and unlike T cells they do not require antigen priming and can kill cells in the absence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation.
  
 Unlike full-length antibodies, TriKE constructs are composed of a single-chain fusion protein that binds the CD16 receptor of NK cells directly producing a potent and lasting cytotoxic killing response, interleukin 15 (IL-15) to promote NK cell activation, persistence and proliferation, and a cancer cell targeting moiety. An additional benefit TriKE may have been attractive biodistribution, as a consequence of their smaller size, which we expect to be important in the treatment of solid tumors. In addition to these advantages, TriKE is designed to be non-immunogenic, have appropriate clearance properties, and can be engineered quickly to target a variety of tumor antigens.
  
  Background and Select Non-Clinical Data
  
 In conjunction with our research agreement with the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota, the exploration of targeting NK cells to a variety of tumors initially focused on novel bi-specific killer engagers, or BiKEs, composed of the variable portions of antibodies targeting the CD16 activating receptor on NK cells and CD33 (AML and MDS; see figure below), CD19/CD22 (B cell lymphomas), or EpCAM (epithelial tumors (breast, colon, and lung)) on the tumor cells.

 Subsequently, a tri-specific (TriKE) construct that replaced the linker molecule between the CD16 scFv and the CD33 scFv with a modified IL-15 molecule, containing flanking sequences, was generated and tested. Data indicate that the CD16 x IL-15 x CD33 and CD16 x IL-15 x EpCAM TriKEs potently induce proliferation of healthy donor NK cells, possibly greater than that induced by exogenous IL-15, which is absent in the BiKE platform. Targeted delivery of the IL-15 through the TriKE also resulted in specific expansion of the NK cells without inducing T cell expansion on post-transplant patient samples.
  
 When compared to the CD16 x CD33 BiKE, the CD16 x IL-15 x CD33 TriKE is also capable of potently restoring killing capacity of post- transplant NK cells against CD33-expressing HL-60 Targets and primary AML blasts. These results demonstrated the ability to functionally incorporate an IL-5 cytokine into the BiKE platform and also demonstrated the possibility of targeting a variety of cytokines directly to NK cells while reducing off-target effects and the amount of cytokines needed to obtain biologically relevant function.
  
 The figure below is a schematic of a BiKE construct (top) and a TriKE construct (bottom), which has the modified IL-15 linker between the CD16 scFv and the CD33 scFv components.
  
 
 The TriKE constructs were also tested against three separate human tumor cell lines: HL-60 (promyelocitic leukemia), Raji (Burkitt’s lymphoma), and HT29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), in addition to a model for ovarian cancer. All cell lines contained the Luc reporter to allow for in vivo imaging of the tumors. These systems were used to show in vivo efficacy of BiKE (1633) and TriKE (GTB-3550) against relevant human tumor targets (HL-60-luc) over an extended period of time. The system consisted of initial conditioning of mice using radiation (250-275 cGy), followed by injection of the tumor cells (I.V. for HL-60-luc and Raji-luc, intra-splenic for HT29-luc and IP for ovarian for MA-148-luc), a three-day growth phase, injection of human NK cells, and repeated injection of the drugs of interest, BiKE and TriKE (three to five times a week). Imaging was carried out at day 7, 14, and 21, and extended as needed.

 Figure A below shows the results (tumor burden and mortality) when dosing NK cells alone (top panel), the BiKE version (lacking IL-15) of GTB-3550 (middle panel; called 1633), and the TriKE, GTB-3550 (bottom panel; then called 161533) in the above human tumor model, HL-60-luc. In the NK-cell-only arm, two out of the five mice were dead by day 21 with two of the surviving mice having extensive tumor burden as depicted by the colored images. In contrast, all five mice in each of the BiKE and TriKE arms survived. In addition, the tumor burden in the TriKE-treated mice was significantly less than in the BiKE-treated mice, demonstrating the improved efficacy from NK cells in the TriKE-treated mice.
  
 
 Based on these results, and others, the IND for GTB-3550 was filed in June 2017 by the University of Minnesota. FDA requested that additional preclinical toxicology be conducted prior to initiating clinical trials. The FDA also requested some additional information and clarifications on the manufacturing (CMC) and clinical packages. The requested additional information and clarifications were completed and incorporated by us into the IND in eCTD format. We filed the IND amendment in June 2018 and announced on November 1, 2018 that we had received notification from the FDA that the IND was open and the Company was authorized to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1 study with GTB-3550 in AML, MDS and severe mastocytosis. We began the Phase 1 clinical trial in September 2019.

  Generation of humanized single-domain antibody targeting CD16 for incorporation into the TriKE platform
  
 To develop second generation TriKEs, we designed a new humanized CD16 engager derived from a single-domain antibody. While scFvs consist of a heavy and a light variable chain joined by a linker, single-domain antibodies consist of a single variable heavy chain capable of engaging without the need of a light chain counterpart (see figure below).

 These single-domain antibodies are thought to have certain attractive features for antibody engineering, including physical stability, ability to bind deep grooves, and increased production yields, amongst others. Pre-clinical studies demonstrated increased activity (NK Cell Degranulation) and functionality (NC Cell Cytokine Production) of the single-domain CD16 TriKE (GTB-C3550) compared to the original TriKE (GTB-3550) (see figure below). These data were presented at the 2017 American Society of Hematology Conference.
  
 
  Targeting Solid Tumors and Other Potentially Attractive Characteristics
  
 Unlike full-length antibodies, TriKE is composed of a single-chain fusion protein that binds the CD16 receptor of NK cells directly producing a potentially more potent and lasting response as demonstrated by preclinical studies. An additional benefit due to the smaller size of TriKE is enhanced biodistribution which we expect to be important in the treatment of solid tumors. In addition to these potential advantages, TriKE is designed to be non-immunogenic, have appropriate clearance properties and can be engineered quickly to target a variety of tumor antigens. We believe these attributes make them an ideal pharmaceutical platform for potentiated NK cell-based immunotherapies and have the potential to overcome some of the limitations of CAR-T therapy and other antibody therapies.
  
 Examples of our earlier stage solid tumor targeting product candidates are focused on EpCAM, Her2, Mesothelin (mesothelioma and lung adenocarcinoma), and CD133 alone and in combination. We believe certain of these constructs have the potential to target prostate, breast, colon, ovarian, liver, and head and neck cancers. Depending on the availability of drug supply, we hope to initiate human clinical testing for certain of our solid tumor product candidates in 2021.
  
  Efficient Advancement of Potential Future Product Candidates --Production and Scale Up
  
 We are using our TriKE platform with the intent to bring to market multiple immuno-oncology products that can treat a range of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and solid tumors. The platforms are scalable, and we are currently working with several third parties investigating the optimal GMP production expression system for TriKE constructs.
  
 We believe TriKE will have the ability, if approved for marketing, to be used on a stand-alone basis, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics, or be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy and potentially overcome certain limitations of current chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR-T, therapy.
  
  Immuno-Oncology Product Candidates
  
  We are initially targeting certain hematologic malignancies as we believe our product candidates may have certain advantages over existing and other in-development products.
   Our TriKE product candidates, GTB-3550 and GTB-C3550, are single-chain, tri-specific scFv recombinant fusion proteins composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains (or heavy chain only) of anti-CD16 antibodies, wild-type or a modified form of IL-15 and the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of an antibody designed to precisely target a specific tumor antigen. We utilize the NK stimulating cytokine human IL-15 as a crosslinker between the two scFvs which is designed to provide a self-sustaining signal leading to the proliferation and activation of NK cells thus enhancing their ability to kill cancer cells mediated by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).

  GTB-3550
  
 GTB-3550 is our first TriKE product candidate. It is a single-chain, tri-specific scFv recombinant fusion protein conjugate composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD16 and anti-CD33 antibodies and a modified form of IL-15. We intend to study this anti-CD16-IL-15-anti-CD33 TriKE in CD33 positive leukemias, a marker expressed on tumor cells in acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, and other hematopoietic malignancies. CD33 is primarily a myeloid differentiation antigen with endocytic properties broadly expressed on AML blasts and, possibly, some leukemic stem cells. CD33 or Siglec-3 (sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 3, SIGLEC3, SIGLEC3, gp67, p67) is a transmembrane receptor expressed on cells of myeloid lineage. It is usually considered myeloid-specific, but it can also be found on some lymphoid cells. The anti-CD33 antibody fragment that will be used for these studies was derived from the M195 humanized anti-CD33 scFV and has been used in multiple human clinical studies. It has been exploited as target for therapeutic antibodies for many years. We believe the recent approval of the antibody-drug conjugate gemtuzumab validates this targeted approach.
  
  About High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
 
 MDS is a rare form of bone marrow-related cancer caused by irregular blood cell production within the bone marrow. As a result of this irregular production, MDS patients do not have sufficient normal red blood cells, white blood cells and/or platelets in circulation. High-risk MDS is associated with poor prognosis, diminished quality of life, and a higher chance of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. Approximately 40% of patients with High-Risk MDS transform to AML, another aggressive cancer with poor outcomes.
 About Acute Myeloid Leukemia
 
 Acute myeloid leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the five-year survival rate is about 35% in people under 60 years old, and 10% in people over 60 years old. Older people whose health is too poor for intensive chemotherapy have a typical survival of five to ten months. AML accounts for roughly 1.8% of cancer deaths in the United States.
 About GTB-3550 TriKE™ Clinical Trial
 
 We opened our GTB-3550 Phase I/II clinical trial in September 2019, and enrolled our first patient in January 2020. Patients with CD33+ malignancies (primary induction failure or relapsed AML with failure of one reinduction attempt or high-risk MDS progressed on two lines of therapy) age 18 and older are eligible (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03214666). The primary endpoint is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GTB-3550 TriKE™. Correlative objectives include the number, phenotype, activation status and function of NK cells and T cells.
 Our Strategy
  
 Our goal is to be a leader in immuno-oncology therapies targeting a broad range of indications including hematological malignancies, sarcoma and solid tumors. Key elements of our strategy are to:
  
  Rapidly advanced our Tri-specific Killer Engagers (TriKEs), GTB-3550 and GTB-C3550
  
 Our TriKE product candidates have the potential to be groundbreaking therapies targeting a broad range of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and solid tumors. We are preparing to study GTB-3550, an anti-CD16-IL-15-anti-CD33 TriKE in CD33 positive leukemias, a marker expressed on tumor cells in AML, MDS and other myeloid malignancies. We began a Phase 1 clinical trial in September 2019 and enrolled our first patient in January 2020 for patients with relapsed/refractory AML. The Phase 1 trial will be a dose finding study. We expect this will be closely followed by Phase 2 trials to determine the most efficacious dosing and cycles with the aim to maximize efficacy while minimizing on-target, off-disease adverse events.

 GTB-C3550 is a next-generation, follow-on, to our lead TriKE, GTB-3550. GTB-3550 studies will help inform the development of GTB-C3550. We believe this will de-risk the GTB-C3550 program as the data being generated will help to make informed decisions on which, or both, will be brought into later phase studies and in which patient populations.
  
  Utilize our TriKE platform technologies to develop a robust pipeline of targeted immuno-oncology products targeting a wide range of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and solid tumors for development on our own and through potential collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies
  
 We are using our TriKE platform with the intent to bring to market multiple, targeted, off-the-shelf therapies that can treat a range of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and solid tumors. The platforms are scalable and we are currently working with several third parties investigating the optimal expression system of the TriKE constructs which we expect to be part of a process in which we are able to produce IND-ready moieties in approximately 90-120 days after the construct conceptual design. After conducting market and competitive research, specific moieties can then be rapidly advanced into the clinic on our own or through potential collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies.
  
 We believe our TriKE will have the ability, if approved for marketing, to be used on a stand-alone basis, augment the current monoclonal antibody therapeutics, or be used in conjunction with more traditional cancer therapy and potentially overcome certain limitations of current chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR-T, therapy.

  B-cell Lymphomas/Leukemias
  
 B-cell lymphoma is a type of cancer that forms in B cells (a type of immune system cell). B-cell lymphomas may be either indolent (slow- growing) or aggressive (fast-growing). Non- Hodgkin lymphoma has an incidence rate of 19.4 per 100,000 per year and B-cell lymphomas make up most (about 85%) of NHL in the United States. There are many different types of B-cell non- Hodgkin lymphomas. These include Burkitt lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma.
 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
  
 Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, is an acute form of leukemia, or cancer of the white blood cells, characterized by the overproduction and accumulation of immature white blood cells, known as lymphoblasts. In persons with ALL, lymphoblasts are overproduced in the bone marrow and continuously multiply, causing damage and death by inhibiting the production of normal cells (such as red and white blood cells and platelets) in the bone marrow and by spreading (infiltrating) to other organs.
  
 "Acute" is defined by the World Health Organization standards, in which greater than 20% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is defined as having less than 20% blasts in the bone marrow. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is seen in both children and adults; the highest incidence is seen between ages 2 to 3 years (>90 cases per 1 million per year). ALL is the most common cancer diagnosed in children and represents approximately 25% of cancer diagnoses among children younger than 15 years. Among children with ALL, approximately 98% attain remission, and approximately 85% of patients aged 1 to 18 years with newly diagnosed ALL treated on current regimens are expected to be long-term event-free survivors, with over 90% surviving at 5 years.
  
  Myeloid Leukemias
  
  Acute Myeloid Leukemia
  
 AML is a heterogeneous hematologic stem cell malignancy in adults with incidence rate of 4.3% per 100,000 populations. The median age at the time of diagnosis is 68 years. AML is an aggressive disease and is fatal without anti-leukemic treatment. AML is the most common form of adult leukemia in the U.S. These patients will require frontline therapy, usually chemotherapy including cytarabine and an anthracycline, a therapy that has not changed in over 40 years. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by dysplastic features of erythroid/myeloid/megakaryocytic lineages, progressive bone marrow failure, a varying percentage of blast cells, and enhanced risk to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia. It is estimated that over 10,000 new cases of MDS are diagnosed each year and there are minimal treatment options; other estimates have put this number higher. In addition, the incidence of MDS is rising for unknown reasons.

  Sarcomas
  
 A sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops from certain tissues, like bone or muscle. Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are the main types of sarcoma. Soft tissue sarcomas can develop from soft tissues like fat, muscle, nerves, fibrous tissues, blood vessels, or deep skin tissues. They can be found in any part of the body. Most of them develop in the arms or legs. They can also be found in the trunk, head and neck area, internal organs, and the area in back of the abdominal cavity (known as the retroperitoneum). Sarcomas are not common tumors, and most cancers are the type of tumors called carcinomas.
  
 The most common types of sarcoma in adults are undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (previously called malignant fibrous histiocytoma), liposarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. Certain types occur more often in certain areas of the body than others. For example, leiomyosarcomas are the most common abdominal sarcoma, while liposarcomas and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma are most common in legs. But pathologists (doctors who specialize in diagnosing cancers by how they look under the microscope), may not always agree on the exact type of sarcoma. Sarcomas of uncertain type are very common.
