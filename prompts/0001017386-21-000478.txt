ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Nine Alliance Science & Technology Group (“Nine Alliance”, “We”, or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 12, 2014, under the name Paramount Supply Inc. The Company then known as Paramount Supply Inc. last filed a financial report with the SEC on August 25, 2017. On September 29, 2017, our name was changed to Nine Alliance Science & Technology Group. On August 27, 2020, a motion and application was made to appoint a Custodian of the Company based on prior management abandoning its responsibilities to continue making filings at the Nevada Secretary of State’s office and for failing to hold a shareholders’ meeting in over 3 years and otherwise failing to keep current in its obligations to the Company.  Upon motion and application to the District Court, Clark County Nevada, the Court granted the request for Custodian for the Company (“Custodian”).   Upon granting the motion, the Court issued an Order acknowledging that the Custodian has performed all of the duties that had been required of it and the management of the Company will revert exclusively to the officers and directors appointed by the Custodian. In the Revival of the Company, Investment Reserves Series, as the Custodian of the Company, appointed Joseph Passalaqua as CEO, CFO and Secretary.
 
The Company is a “blank check company,” as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We have not had preliminary contact or discussions with, nor do we have any present plans, proposals, arrangements, or understandings with, any representatives of the owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger. We are a “shell company” within the meaning of Rule 405, promulgated pursuant to Securities Act, because we do have no hard assets and real business operations. 
 
From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company and the initial equity funding by our sole officer and director. We received our initial funding of $4,000 from a previous sole officer and director at that time who purchased 4,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share. Our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for our Company which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 


Previous business operations of the Company generated limited revenues and the Company currently has no business operations.
 No revenue has been generated in the last two years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2021. 
 
On June 2, 2021, we voluntarily filed a termination of our registration statement on Form 15-15D pursuant to Rule 15d-6 and our termination becomes effective 90 days thereafter. The Company has since been seeking a merger target and has been evaluating various opportunities.
 We never sold any securities under the offering statement, so there was no need to keep the prospectus and Form S-1 filing current.
 
The Company filed a Registration Statement; Form-10-12g on June 16, 2021 and was effective 60 days post filing.
 
We are subject to the requirements of Regulation 13A under the Exchange Act, which require us to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and we are required to comply with all other obligations of the Exchange Act applicable to issuers filing registration statements pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.
 
We are not currently engaged in any business operations. We are, however, in the process of attempting to identify, locate, and if warranted, acquire new commercial opportunities. The Company is currently attempting to locate and negotiate with eligible portfolio companies to acquire an interest in them. In addition to acquiring an interest in them, the Company intends to assist these portfolio companies with raising capital and offer them substantial managerial assistance needed to succeed.
 
The authorized capital stock of Nine Alliance Science & Technology Group consists of 290,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”) and 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the “Preferred”).
 As of September 30, 2021, there were 75,000,000 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and no shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.
