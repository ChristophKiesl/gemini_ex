This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for "forward-looking statements" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may include statements that expressly or implicitly predict future results, performance or events. Statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "estimates," "intends" and "forecast" and words or phrases of similar meaning. 
We make forward-looking statements about the projected impact on our business operations of the COVID-19 pandemic; Next Gen 2.0 initiatives including store consolidations, operational improvements, and facilities rationalizations; the sale of Umpqua Investments, Inc.; LIBOR; derivatives and hedging; the results and performance of models and economic forecasts used in our calculation of the allowance for credit loss; projected sources of funds and the Company's liquidity position; our securities portfolio; loan sales; adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, including the reserve for unfunded commitments; provision for credit losses; non-performing loans and future losses; performance of troubled debt restructurings; our commercial real estate portfolio, its collectability and subsequent charge-offs; resolution of non-accrual loans; PPP forgiveness and SBA fees; the economic environment; litigation; dividends; junior subordinated debentures; fair values of certain assets and liabilities, including mortgage servicing rights values and sensitivity analyses; tax rates; and the effect of accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting methodology.

We also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of the Company, market conditions, capital requirements, applicable law and regulations (including federal securities laws and state and federal banking laws and regulations), and other factors deemed relevant by the Company's Board of Directors, and will be subject to regulatory approval or conditions. 
Forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond our control. There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include those set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the following factors that might cause actual results to differ materially from those presented:
•the significant risks and uncertainties for our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios and other regulatory requirements, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which will depend on several factors, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, its influence on the economy and financial markets, the effectiveness of our work from home arrangements and staffing levels in operational facilities, challenges associated with our return to office plans such as maintaining a safe office environment and integrating at-home and in-office staff, the impact of market participants on which we rely and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and the impact of lower equity market valuations on our service and management fee revenue;

Business Strategy
Umpqua Bank's primary objective is to become the leading community-oriented financial services organization throughout the Western United States. We intend to increase market share, grow our assets and increase profitability and total shareholder return by differentiating ourselves from competitors through the following strategies:
Deliver on Corporate Strategic Objectives. The Company's 3-year (2018-2020) corporate strategic objectives branded as "Umpqua Next Gen" were designed to modernize the company, diversify and increase revenue, optimize processes and improve efficiency. Umpqua Next Gen builds on our customer-centric approach to banking, allowing us to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace and create a competitive advantage. The three pillars of Umpqua Next Gen include: Balanced Growth, Human Digital, and Operational Excellence. In late 2020, Umpqua launched "Next Gen 2.0" which further expands these objectives.
•Through Our Balanced Growth Initiatives, We Focus on Banking Full Customer Relationships. The Company has invested in broader product suites to meet the needs of customers across the spectrum of our business lines. We believe that Umpqua has the products and associate expertise necessary to support current and prospective customers. We believe we can bring the highest value to customers when internal lines of business work collaboratively to serve customers and exceed expectations. Umpqua's value proposition is to combine the product offerings of many larger competitors but deliver with a highly focused, customer centric approach. The importance of Balanced Growth initiatives have been embedded in modernizing our internal referral and goal-driven incentive plans to reward collaborative behavior and growth across product categories.
•Use A Human Digital Banking Approach to Retain and Expand Customer Base. As customer preferences and behaviors evolve with technological adoption, our strategy remains consistent: deliver an extraordinary experience across all customer touchpoints. As a result, we have developed our Human Digital banking approach, which uses technology to empower deeper, even more meaningful relationships with our customers across all lines of business. We believe this differentiates Umpqua and positions the Company well to adapt quickly as customer use of physical and digital channels evolves. Our innovative store concept remains a differentiator in this Human Digital approach as the combination of digital banking services, through platforms like Umpqua Go-To® and commercial focused applications. Our Human Digital approach enhances our ability to attract a broader range of customers and expand our value proposition across all channels. 
•Become A More Efficient and Effective Company Through Operational Excellence Programs. The objectives of the operational excellence programs are to reduce redundancies, simplify processes, and ultimately bring associates closer to the customer. Umpqua has redesigned several key processes, including our commercial loan delivery and our deposit origination processes since the beginning of Umpqua Next Gen. In addition to combining similar functions throughout the Company, we have also simplified our supplier and vendor relationships by consolidating spend to key strategic partners.
Establish Strong Brand Awareness. We devote considerable resources to developing the "Umpqua Bank" brand through design strategy, marketing, and delivery through our customer-facing channels, as well as through active public relations, social media and community-based events and initiatives. Umpqua's goal is to connect with our customers and communities in fresh and engaging ways. The unique look and feel of our stores and interactive displays help demonstrate our commitment to being an innovative, customer-friendly provider of financial products and services, and our active community engagement and investments stand out with commercial customers. Our brand activation approach is based on actions, not just advertising, and builds strong consumer awareness of our products and services.
Prudently Manage Capital. An important part of our strategy is to continue to manage capital prudently, and to employ excess capital in a thoughtful and opportunistic manner that improves long-term shareholder returns. We accomplish this through organic growth and a top quartile dividend payout ratio for regional banks. We also opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions, which could include technology-driven enterprises or banks and financial services companies in markets or lines of business where we see growth potential.

Growth Culture. We believe strongly that by investing in the professional growth of our associates and supporting the economic growth of our communities, we will create more opportunity to provide our products and services and to create deeper customer relationships across all divisions, from retail to mortgage and wholesale. Although a successful marketing program will attract customers to visit, well-trained and experienced associates are critical to solving customer needs with the right products and services. 
Products and Services
We offer an array of financial products, delivered through traditional and digital channels, to meet the banking needs of our market area and target customers. To ensure the ongoing viability of our product offerings, we regularly examine the desirability and profitability of existing and potential new products. Our customers can access our products through online banking, mobile banking applications, including Umpqua Go-To® app, and Umpquabank.com.
Commercial Loans and Leases and Commercial Real Estate Loans. We offer specialized loans for corporate and commercial customers, including accounts receivable and inventory financing, multifamily loans, equipment loans, commercial equipment leases, international trade finance, real estate construction loans and permanent financing and Small Business Administration program financing as well as capital markets and treasury management services. 
Treasury Management. As Umpqua focuses on banking the full customer relationship and meeting the needs of customers of all sizes, we offer treasury management products to our customers through our Global Payments & Deposits group. These products include ACH, wires, positive pay, remote deposit capture, integrated payables, commercial card, and foreign exchange related products. We also offer merchant services in coordination with a strategic partner, Worldpay.
Deposit Products. We offer deposit products, including non-interest bearing checking accounts, interest bearing checking and savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Interest-bearing accounts earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management's desire to increase certain types or maturities of deposit liabilities. Our approach is to provide a streamlined customer experience that meets the customer's needs across all channels. This approach is designed to add value for the customer, increase products per household and generate related fee income. 
Wealth Management. Through Umpqua's Private Bank, we serve high net worth individuals and families, and select non-profits and professional services firms, providing deposit, lending, and financial planning solutions. The Private Bank is designed to expand on Umpqua's existing high-touch customer experience and works collaboratively with other internal departments to offer a comprehensive, integrated approach designed to meet clients' financial needs.
Residential Real Estate Loans. Real estate loans are available for the construction, purchase, and refinancing of residential owner-occupied and rental properties. Borrowers can choose from a variety of fixed and adjustable rate options and terms. We sell most residential real estate loans that we originate into the secondary market. Servicing is retained on the majority of these loans.

Consumer Loans. We provide loans to individual borrowers for a variety of purposes, including secured and unsecured personal loans, home equity and personal lines of credit and motor vehicle loans.
Market Area and Competition
The geographic markets we serve are highly competitive for deposits, loans, leases and retail brokerage services. We compete with traditional banking institutions, as well as non-bank financial service providers, such as credit unions, brokerage firms, mortgage companies, and online based financial service providers. In our primary market areas of Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, and Nevada, major national banks generally hold top market share positions. Competition also includes small community banks that operate in a concentrated area within our footprint and other regional banks that focus on commercial and retail banking.
As the industry becomes increasingly oriented toward technology-driven delivery systems, permitting transactions to be conducted on mobile devices and computers, non-bank institutions are able to attract customers and provide lending and other financial services even without offices located in our primary service area. Some insurance companies and brokerage firms compete for deposits by offering rates that are higher than the weighted average market price and may be inappropriate for the Bank in relation to its asset and liability management objectives. 
Table of Contents

Credit unions present a significant competitive challenge for our banking services and products. As credit unions currently enjoy an exemption from income tax, they are able to offer higher deposit rates and lower loan rates than banks can on a comparable basis. Credit unions are also not currently subject to certain regulatory constraints, such as the Community Reinvestment Act, which, among other things, requires us to implement procedures to make and monitor loans throughout the communities we serve. Adhering to such regulatory requirements raises the costs associated with our lending activities and reduces potential operating profits. Accordingly, we seek to compete by focusing on building customer relationships, providing superior service and offering a wide variety of commercial banking products.
The following tables present the Bank's market share percentage for total deposits as of June 30, 2020, in each county where we have operations. The table also indicates the ranking by deposit size in each market. All information in the table was obtained from S&P Global, which compiles deposit data published by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as of June 30, 2020 and updates the information for any bank mergers and acquisitions completed subsequent to the reporting date.

Human Capital
At Umpqua, we are committed to creating an environment where our associates are inspired to be their best. Umpqua is powered by a team of nearly 4,000 associates working together to provide expert banking solutions that are rooted in deep human connection. Our people are the key to our success. In return, we strive to create a work experience that allows our associates to use their skills and passions to make a difference, while growing their careers, and being recognized for their diverse talents, backgrounds, and perspectives.

The ability to attract, retain, develop, and engage a talented and diverse workforce is critical to executing our business strategy. As of December 31, 2020, we employed a total of 3,920 employees, 87% of which were full-time associates. Our workforce is comprised of customer-facing associates across our various business lines, as well as professionals in various support functions that enable the business. Approximately 28% of our workforce was comprised of frontline retail store associates, nearly 17% were in our Home Lending division, 22% were in our wholesale businesses, and the remaining 33% were in support functions such as technology, finance, risk, audit, and human resources. 
Employee Health and Safety. As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, as a threat to health and safety of our workforce, we moved most of our non-store workforce to remote operations. We were well-positioned from a technology standpoint to make this pivot and continued to be productive as our teams shifted to a remote work environment. Over time, and after putting in place appropriate safety measures, we migrated back designated functions and departments that operate most effectively in an on-site work arrangement. As of December 31, 2020, 60% of our workforce continues to work either fully remotely, or with only intermittent on-site access up to a few hours a week. 
Because our business is considered an essential service vital to our communities, keeping our stores operational while protecting our associates and our customers was of critical importance. For those associates working on-site, we established several safety protocols, including occupancy limits and controls, physical distancing requirements and barriers, daily personal health attestation, enhanced cleaning, and required face coverings. These practices applied as well to the non-store associates working at or visiting Umpqua locations. 
In support of our associates, we established a pandemic pay program to provide supplemental assistance to associates who needed to take time away from work for COVID-related illness, suspected illness, quarantine, or for childcare issues due to school closure. As of December 31, 2020, nearly 20% of our associates have utilized this program. 
Associate Experience. Our workforce decreased by 5% during 2020, which was driven primarily by natural attrition. We did not have any significant reduction-in-force activities that were pandemic-related, or otherwise. Turnover rate, as calculated in our payroll system, in 2020 was 20%, and of this, 17% was voluntary. 
We attract and reward our associates by providing market competitive compensation and benefit practices. Our compensation approach is designed to pay for performance and reward associate contributions. Each position has an established compensation range and associates have the opportunity to earn at the high end of their respective range for top performance. Our salary structure is informed by market data, and recognizing that the compensation environment is dynamic, we review and adjust our pay ranges regularly. This includes an ongoing practice of analyzing pay equity. In addition, many positions have incentive plans to encourage achievement of various corporate, business unit, and individual goals.
We offer competitive medical, dental, vision, life, short and long-term disability, and accident insurance, in addition to paid time off for vacation, sick time, and volunteerism. These programs are available to associates working 20 hours per week or more and are assessed regularly against market benchmarks. 
On a regular basis, we conduct an associate engagement survey to gain insights into associate sentiment about various aspects of the associate experience. This feedback is used to assess the effectiveness of our people practices and prioritize enhancements to our programs. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Umpqua Bank embraces the opportunity to foster a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion in our associates, customers, and communities. With the adoption of a comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion strategic plan in 2020, our ongoing key focus areas will be connected to values integration, community engagement, being an employer of choice. We have accelerated the rollout of intensive internal training, which began in 2020 and will continue in 2021. Additionally, we have continued to expand programs that support an inclusive work environment, such as our Associate Resource Groups, which are open to all associates, and focus on gender, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability or veteran status. 
Recently, we launched a new Inclusion Council that will, in partnership with our Diversity Council, identify opportunities for further internal operational improvements. They will also identify ways to deepen our commitment to drive economic opportunity in communities of color through our community engagement programs. One illustration of our commitment at the most senior level is in the diverse make-up of our Board of Directors—chaired by a woman and including four women and three people of color.

Information about our Executive Officers
Information regarding employment agreements with our executive officers is contained in Item 11 below, which item is incorporated by reference to our proxy statement for the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders.
Government Policies
The operations of the Company and our subsidiaries are affected by state and federal legislative and regulatory changes and by policies of various regulatory authorities, including, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, United States fiscal policy, and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies. 
Supervision and Regulation
General. We are extensively regulated under federal and state law. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not shareholders. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation. Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation or regulation may have in the future. Umpqua is subject to the disclosure and other requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and rules promulgated thereunder and administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a listed company on NASDAQ, Umpqua is subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies.
The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted non-capital safety and soundness standards for financial institutions. These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. 
Holding Company Regulation. We are a bank holding company registered as a financial holding company under the GLB Act, and are subject to the supervision of, and regulation by the Federal Reserve. As a bank holding company, we are examined by and file reports with the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank.
Financial holding companies are bank holding companies that satisfy certain criteria and are permitted to engage in activities that traditional bank holding companies are not. The qualifications and permitted activities of financial holdings companies are described below under "Regulatory Structure of the Financial Services Industry." 
Federal and State Bank Regulation. Umpqua Bank, as a state chartered bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, is primarily subject to the supervision and regulation of the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services Division of Financial Regulation, the Washington Department of Financial Institutions, the California Department of Business Oversight, the Idaho Department of Finance Banking Section, the Nevada Division of Financial Institutions, the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Our primary state regulator, DCBS, regularly examines the Bank or participates in joint examinations with the FDIC; these agencies may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. 
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. Umpqua Bank has a responsibility under the CRA, as implemented by FDIC regulations, to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The FDIC assesses Umpqua Bank's record of compliance with the CRA through periodic examinations. 
In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. Umpqua Bank's failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions against it by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies, including the CFPB and the Department of Justice.

CRA performance is considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility. Umpqua Bank's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of Umpqua potentially resulting in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved.
In 2018, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued a memorandum to the federal banking regulators with recommended changes to the CRA's implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks. In 2019, the FDIC and the OCC jointly proposed rules that would significantly change existing CRA regulations. The proposed rules are intended to increase bank activity in low- and moderate-income communities where there is significant need for credit, more responsible lending, greater access to banking services, and improvements to critical infrastructure. The proposals change four key areas: (i) clarifying what activities qualify for CRA credit; (ii) updating where activities count for CRA credit; (iii) providing a more transparent and objective method for measuring CRA performance; and (iv) revising CRA-related data collection, record keeping, and reporting. However, the Federal Reserve Board did not join in that proposed rulemaking. In May 2020, the OCC issued its final CRA rule, effective October 1, 2020. The FDIC has not finalized the revisions to its CRA rule. In September 2020, the Federal Reserve issued its own CRA proposal to modernize the regulations that implement the CRA by strengthening, clarifying, and tailoring them to reflect the current banking landscape and better meet the core purpose of the CRA. We will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing CRA. As of the most recent CRA examination, the Bank's CRA rating was "Satisfactory". 
Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Banks are subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interest of such persons. Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions. 
The Federal Reserve Act and related Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of Umpqua or its subsidiaries. Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies. Umpqua and its subsidiaries have adopted an Affiliate Transactions Policy and have entered into various affiliate agreements designed to comply with Regulation W.
Privacy. Federal and state laws designed to protect individual privacy limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to affiliated companies and non-affiliated third parties, and impose other obligations on personal information collected by us. These rules require disclosure of privacy policies to clients and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of opt-out or opt-in authorizations. Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain state laws, companies are required to notify clients of security breaches resulting in unauthorized access to their personal information. In connection with the regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial information, the federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information. 
States are also increasingly proposing or enacting legislation that relates to data privacy and data protection such as the California Consumer Privacy Act which went into effect on January 1, 2020. We expect this trend of state-level activity in these areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located.
Federal Deposit Insurance. Substantially all deposits with Umpqua Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The standard maximum federal deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per qualified account.

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines that the institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation or order or any condition imposed in writing by, or pursuant to, any written agreement with the FDIC. The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Dividends. Under the Oregon Bank Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, the Bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of cash dividends to its parent company and may be required to receive prior approval in certain circumstances. In addition, state and federal regulatory authorities are authorized to prohibit banks and holding companies from paying dividends that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve's view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. 
As a result of the goodwill impairment taken in the first quarter of 2020, the Company has an accumulated deficit and is required to notify the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System prior to declaring and paying a cash dividend to our shareholders and may not pay a dividend if the FRB objects. Additionally, the Company is required to seek FDIC and Oregon Division of Financial Regulation approval for quarterly dividends from Umpqua Bank to the Company.
Capital Adequacy. The federal and state bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in their examination and regulation of holding companies and banks. If capital falls below the minimum levels established by these guidelines, a holding company or a bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open new facilities. 
The FDIC and Federal Reserve have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for holding companies and banks. The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among holding companies and banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weightings. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. The capital adequacy guidelines limit the degree to which a holding company or bank may leverage its equity capital. 
The Company and the Bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve, which are based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to the Basel capital framework. 
The Basel III final rules, among other things, include the common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The required CET1 ratio is a minimum of 7%. The minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is 8.5%, and the minimum leverage ratio is 5.0%. 
Under Basel III, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, the Company and the Bank, have made a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Company's securities portfolio. 
Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement actions. An institution's failure to exceed the capital conservation buffer with common equity Tier 1 capital would result in limitations on an institution's ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. FDICIA requires federal banking regulators to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to a capital-deficient institution, including requiring a capital restoration plan and restricting certain growth activities of the institution. Umpqua could be required to guarantee any such capital restoration plan required of the Bank if the Bank became undercapitalized. Pursuant to FDICIA, regulations were adopted defining five capital levels: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, severely undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the regulations, the Bank is considered "well capitalized" as of December 31, 2020.

In July 2019, the OCC, the FRB, and the FDIC issued a final rule intended to simplify aspects of the regulatory capital rules for banking organizations, such as Umpqua, that are not advanced approaches banking organizations. The final rule includes amendments to the capital treatment of mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets, investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions, and minority interests. These amendments were effective for Umpqua as of January 1, 2020. Pursuant to a final rule issued in July 2019, the transition provisions that were previously frozen have been replaced with new permanent rules effective in April 2020. Additionally, on March 27, 2020, federal bank regulatory agencies announced an interim final rule that allows banks that have implemented the current expected credit losses standard the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. For purposes of calculating regulatory capital, the Company has elected to defer recognition of the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital for two years in accordance with the interim final rule adopted by federal bank regulatory agencies on March 27, 2020. Pursuant to the interim final rule, the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital will be phased in over a three-year period beginning in 2022.
Federal and State Regulation of Broker-Dealers. Umpqua Investments is regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, as well as the SEC, and has customer funds, excluding decline in value of securities, insured through the Securities Investor Protection Corporation as well as third party insurers. FINRA and the SEC perform regular examinations of Umpqua Investments that include reviews of policies, procedures, recordkeeping, trade practices, and customer protection as well as other inquiries.
Effects of Government Monetary Policy. Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the Federal Reserve, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits. These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty. 
In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, its effect on economic activity in the near term and the risk it poses to the economic outlook, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered the target range for the federal funds rate 150 basis points to 0.00% to 0.25%. At its September 2020 meeting the FOMC noted it expects to maintain an accommodating stance of monetary policy until the outcomes of employment and inflation targets over the longer run is achieved. 
Regulation of the Financial Services Industry. Federal laws and regulations governing banking and financial services underwent significant changes in recent years and we believe will continue to undergo significant changes in the future. From time to time, legislation is introduced in the United States Congress that contains proposals for altering the structure, regulation, and competitive relationships of the nation's financial institutions. If enacted into law, these proposals could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, and other financial institutions. Whether or in what form any such legislation may be adopted or the extent to which our business might be affected thereby cannot be predicted. 
The GLB Act, enacted in November 1999, repealed sections of the Banking Act of 1933, commonly referred to as the Glass-Steagall Act, that prohibited banks from engaging in securities activities, and prohibited securities firms from engaging in banking. The GLB Act created a new form of holding company, known as a financial holding company, that is permitted to acquire subsidiaries that are engaged in banking, securities underwriting and dealing, and insurance underwriting. 
To qualify as a financial holding company, the bank holding company must be deemed to be well-capitalized and well-managed, as those terms are used by the Federal Reserve. In addition, each subsidiary bank of a bank holding company must also be well-capitalized and well-managed and be rated at least "satisfactory" under the CRA. A bank holding company that does not qualify, or has not chosen, to become a financial holding company must limit its activities to traditional banking activities and those non-banking activities the Federal Reserve has deemed to be permissible because they are closely related to the business of banking.

The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 permits interstate banking and branching, which allows banks to expand nationwide through acquisition, consolidation or merger. Under this law, an adequately capitalized bank holding company may acquire banks in any state or merge banks across state lines if permitted by state law. Further, banks may establish and operate branches in any state subject to the restrictions of applicable state law. Under Oregon law, an out-of-state bank or bank holding company may merge with or acquire an Oregon state chartered bank or bank holding company upon receipt of approval from the Director of the DCBS. The Bank has the ability to open additional de novo branches in the states of Oregon, California, Washington, Idaho, and Nevada. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act eliminated interstate branching restrictions that were implemented as part of the Riegle-Neal Act, and removed many restrictions on de novo interstate branching by national and state-chartered banks. The FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have authority to approve applications by insured state non-member banks and national banks, respectively, to establish de novo branches in states other than the bank's home state if the law of the state in which the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch, if the bank were a state bank chartered by such State. 
Anti-Terrorism Legislation. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks, as well as imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening and holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals. Banks are also required to have effective compliance processes in place relating to anti-money laundering compliance, as well as compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.
The Dodd-Frank Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act was a sweeping overhaul of financial industry regulation. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council and permanently raised the FDIC deposit insurance coverage to $250,000. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act added additional requirements on Banks and their regulators, including additional interchange fee limits, mortgage limit requirements, and say-on-pay executive compensation requirements.
Stress Testing and Capital Planning.  Initially, Umpqua was subject to annual Dodd-Frank Act capital stress testing requirements of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.  As part of the DFAST process, Umpqua was required to submit the results of the company-run stress tests to the FDIC, and Umpqua disclosed certain results from stress testing exercises.  However, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, modified provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that changed Umpqua's requirements. Umpqua internally monitors and stress tests its capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of its regulators.
CFPB Regulation and Supervision. The CFPB has authority to examine Umpqua and Umpqua Bank for compliance with a broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations that relate to credit card, deposit, mortgage and other consumer financial products and services the Bank offers. The CFPB is authorized to issue regulations and take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The agency also has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. In addition, the CFPB's regulations require lenders to conduct a reasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation of a residential mortgage loan that the borrower will have a reasonable ability to repay the loan. 
Joint Agency Guidance on Incentive Compensation. Federal banking regulators joint agency guidance applies to executive and non-executive incentive compensation plans administered by banks. The guidance says that incentive compensation programs must:
•Provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward;
•Be compatible with effective controls and risk- management; and
•Be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the board.
The Federal Reserve reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of the Company and other banking organizations. The findings of the supervisory initiatives are included in reports of examination and any deficiencies will be incorporated into the Company's supervisory ratings, which can affect the Company's ability to make acquisitions and take other actions.

Regulatory Developments Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic
The U.S. Congress, the FRB and U.S. state and federal regulatory agencies have taken actions to mitigate disruptions to economic activity and financial stability resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The descriptions below summarize certain significant government actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The CARES Act. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and has subsequently been amended. Among other provisions, the CARES Act includes relief from certain U.S. GAAP requirements to allow COVID-19-related loan modifications to not be categorized as TDR loans as well as a range of incentives to encourage deferment, forbearance or modification of consumer credit and mortgage contracts. In addition to the CARES Act, bank regulatory agencies issued interagency guidance indicating that a lender could conclude that the modifications under section 4013 of the CARES Act or the interagency guidance are not a TDR if certain criteria are met. The guidance also provides that loans generally will not be adversely classified if the short-term modification is related to COVID-19 relief programs. The Company has followed the guidance under the CARES Act, interagency guidance and state programs related to these loan modifications
The CARES Act also focused on economic stabilization and relief to severely distressed businesses with the Paycheck Protection Program, administered by the SBA, which provided loans for eligible small businesses for payroll obligations, emergency grants to cover immediate operating costs, and a mechanism for loan forgiveness. 
The CARES Act contains additional protections for homeowners and renters of properties with federally-backed mortgages, including a 60-day moratorium on the initiation of foreclosure proceedings and a 120-day moratorium on initiating eviction proceedings. Borrowers of federally-backed mortgages have the right under the CARES Act to request up to 360 days of forbearance on their mortgage payments if they experience financial hardship directly or indirectly due to COVID-19 pandemic. The Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have independently extended their moratorium on foreclosures and evictions for single-family federally backed mortgages as well.
Also pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support of eligible businesses, states and municipalities impacted by the economic effects of COVID-19.
In late December 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act rebooted the PPP with many of the same parameters as the first program but with some important differences. Those changes include the ability for businesses that previously received a PPP loan to be eligible for a second-draw PPP loan, provided they meet the certain criteria. The Act also opened up first-draw PPP loans to additional companies and set aside funds for new and smaller borrowers, low and moderate income borrowers and for community and small lenders. It also allowed additional costs to be eligible for loan forgiveness and PPP borrowers will have to spend no less than 60% of the funds on payroll over a covered period. 
FRB Actions. The FRB has taken a range of actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses including reducing the target fed funds rate and maintaining an accommodating stance on monetary policy. The FRB also announced that it would increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities and begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. The FRB has also encouraged depository institutions to borrow from the discount window and has lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowings by 150 basis points while extending the term of such loans up to 90 days. Reserve requirements have been reduced to zero as of March 26, 2020.
In addition, the FRB has established, a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S. economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to economic disruptions associated with COVID-19. Through these facilities and programs, the FRB has taken steps to directly or indirectly purchase assets from, or make loans to, U.S. companies, financial institutions, municipalities and other market participants. The FRB established the Payroll Protection Program Liquidity Facility. Under the PPLF, the Bank can obtain financing for PPP loans by pledging them to the FRB. We also have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank by pledging the PPP loans.
Additional legislative and regulatory action may be proposed and could include requirements that could significantly impact our business practices. The impact of these legislative and regulatory initiatives on us, the economy and the U.S. consumer will depend upon a wide variety of factors some of which are yet to be identified.
