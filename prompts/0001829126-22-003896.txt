Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
As of September 30, 2021, we were a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 30, 2020. We were incorporated for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to in this report as our initial business combination.
 
On October 13, 2020, we issued 2,875,000 founder shares to our sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share, in connection with our organization. On December 7, 2020, we effected a stock dividend of 287,500 shares with respect to our Class B common stock, resulting in there being an aggregate of 3,162,500 founder shares outstanding. On December 10, 2020, in connection with the underwriters’ partial exercise of their over-allotment option and waiver of the remaining portion of such option, simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, our sponsor forfeited an aggregate of 37,500 founder shares to us at no cost, and 3,125,000 founder shares remain outstanding at September 30, 2021, representing an adjusted purchase price of approximately $0.008 per share.
 
The registration statements on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-250212 and 333-251190) for our initial public offering became effective on December 7, 2020. On December 10, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering of 12,500,000 units, inclusive of 1,500,000 units sold to the underwriters upon the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option, at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $125,000,000. Each unit consisted of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The warrants became exercisable 30 days after the consummation of our initial business combination and will expire five years after the consummation of our initial business combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, including the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 370,000 private units to our sponsor and the forward purchase investors at a price of $10.00 per private unit, generating total proceeds of $3,700,000 (the “private placement”). Among the private units, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 296,000 private units and the forward purchase investors purchased an aggregate of 74,000 private units.
 
A total of $125,000,000 (or $10.00 per unit sold in our initial public offering) of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “trust account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We incurred $2,966,508 in transaction costs, including $2,500,000 of underwriting fees and $466,508 of other offering costs, in connection with our initial public offering. As of September 30, 2021, we had marketable securities held in the trust account of $125,056,567 (including approximately $50,181 of interest income, net of unrealized gain) and cash of $268,360 held outside the trust account.

As of September 30, 2021, our units, Class A common stock and warrants traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “DDMXU,” “DDMX” and “DDMXW,” respectively. Our units commenced public trading on December 8, 2020, and our Class A common stock and warrants commenced separate public trading on January 27, 2021. On November 30, 2021, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC filed a Form 25 (Notification of Removal from Listing) with the SEC relating to the delisting of our units, Class A common stock and warrants. As a result, our units, Class A common stock and warrants are no longer listed on the Nasdaq.
 
Codere Business Combination
 
On June 21, 2021, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with Codere Newco, SEJO, Holdco and Merger Sub, which provided for the Codere Business Combination that resulted, among other things, in the Company and SEJO becoming wholly-owned subsidiaries of Holdco, as described in more detail in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. In connection with the Codere Business Combination, Holdco filed a registration statement on Form F-4 (File No. 333-258759) (as subsequently amended, the “Form F-4”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on August 12, 2021 that included a proxy statement with respect to our special meeting of stockholders, which was held on November 18, 2021to approve the Business Combination Agreement, among other matters, as well as a prospectus of Holdco with respect to the issuance of Holdco securities in the Codere Business Combination.
 
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, following the effectiveness of (i) the contribution and exchange, effective at 10:00 a.m. New York time on November 29, 2021 (the “Exchange Effective Time”), by Codere Newco of its ordinary shares of SEJO, all with a nominal value of €1.00 per share, (the “SEJO Ordinary Shares”) to Holdco in exchange for additional ordinary shares of Holdco, with a nominal value of €1.00 per share (the “Holdco Ordinary Shares”), which were subscribed for by Codere Newco (the “Exchange”), as contemplated by and pursuant to the Contribution and Exchange Agreement, dated as of June 21, 2021, by and between Holdco, SEJO and Codere Newco (the “Contribution and Exchange Agreement”) and (ii) the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco (the “Merger”) at 12:01 a.m. New York time on November 30, 2021 (the “Merger Effective Time”), the parties consummated the Codere Business Combination and SEJO and the Company became direct wholly-owned subsidiaries of Holdco. Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, each of the following transactions occurred in the following order:
 

● | pursuant to the Contribution and Exchange Agreement, Codere Newco, effective on the Exchange Effective Time, contributed its SEJO Ordinary Shares constituting all the issued and outstanding share capital of SEJO to Holdco in exchange for additional Holdco Ordinary Shares, which were subscribed for by Codere Newco. As a result of the Exchange, SEJO became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco and Holdco continued to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Codere Newco at the Exchange Effective Time;

● | after the Exchange and immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, each share of the Company’s Class B common stock automatically converted into and exchanged for one share of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Class B Conversion”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | on the Closing (as defined below) date, pursuant to the Merger, Merger Sub merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such merger and becoming a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco and, in connection therewith, the Company’s corporate name changed to “Codere Online U.S. Corp.”;

● | in connection with the Merger, all shares of the Company’s Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, but after the Class B Conversion, were contributed to Holdco in exchange for the Merger Consideration (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) in the form of one Holdco Ordinary Share for each share of the Company’s Class A common stock pursuant to the share capital increase of Holdco by way of the issuance of one Holdco Ordinary Share in consideration of each share of the Company’s Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (which for the avoidance of doubt did not include shares of the Company’s Class A common stock as to which redemption rights were exercised) (the “Holdco Capital Increase”), as set forth in the Business Combination Agreement; and

● | as of the Merger Effective Time, each warrant of the Company that was outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time no longer represented a right to acquire one share of the Company’s DD3 Class A common stock and instead represented the right to acquire one Holdco Ordinary Share on substantially the same terms.

Codere Newco held 30,000,000 Holdco Ordinary Shares upon consummation of the Exchange.
 
At the Merger Effective Time, each share of the Company’s Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time was exchanged for one validly issued and fully paid Holdco Ordinary Share.On November 30, 2021, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC filed a Form 25 (Notification of Removal from Listing) with the SEC relating to the delisting of our units, warrants and Class A common stock. As a result, our units, warrants and Class A common stock were delisted on the Nasdaq. On December 14, 2021, we filed a Form 15 certifying the deregistration of our units, warrants and Class A common stock under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and suspension of our duty to file reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act have been suspended.
 
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2021, we had three executive officers. As of February 16, 2022, we have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and devoted only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. We expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
 
We have filed electronically with the SEC this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (including our amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A) and Current Reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Such reports and other information filed by the company with the SEC are available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. 
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “ Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. However, if our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period exceeds $1 billion or the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year.

Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
 
On November 30, 2021, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC filed a Form 25 (Notification of Removal from Listing) with the SEC relating to the delisting of our units, warrants and Class A common stock. As a result, our units, warrants and Class A common stock were delisted on the Nasdaq. On December 14, 2021, we filed a Form 15 certifying the deregistration of our units, warrants and Class A common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and suspension of our duty to file reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company’s reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act have been suspended. As a result, this Form 10-K will be the last report filed by the Company with the SEC unless circumstances change in the future (e.g., an increase in stockholders above the applicable threshold) and reporting obligations are re-activated.
