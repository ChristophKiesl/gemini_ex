Item 1. Business
General

Hill International, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in 2006, with approximately 2,700 professionals in more than 60 offices worldwide, provides project management, construction management and other consulting services primarily to the building, transportation, environmental, energy and industrial markets. The terms “Hill”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Hill International, Inc.

We compete for business based on a variety of factors such as technical capability, global resources, price, reputation and past experience, including client requirements for substantial experience in similar projects. We have developed significant long-standing relationships, which bring us repeat business and would be very difficult to replicate. We believe we have an excellent reputation for attracting and retaining professionals. In addition, we believe there are high barriers to entry for new competitors, especially in the project management market.
The Company provides fee-based project and construction management services to our clients, leveraging our construction expertise to identify potential trouble, difficulties and sources of delay on a construction project before they develop into costly problems. Our experienced professionals are capable of managing all phases of the construction process from concept through completion, including cost and budget controls, scheduling, estimating, expediting, inspection, contract administration and management of contractors, subcontractors and suppliers.
Our clients are typically billed a negotiated multiple of the actual direct cost of each professional assigned to a project and we are reimbursed for our out-of-pocket expenses. We believe our fee-based consulting has significant advantages over traditional general contractors. Specifically, because we do not assume project completion risk, our fee-based model eliminates many of the risks typically associated with providing “at risk” construction services.
Amounts throughout the remainder of this document are in thousands unless otherwise noted.

Our Strategy

Our strategy emphasizes the following key elements:


• | Increase Revenues from Our Existing Clients. We have long-standing relationships with a number of public and private sector entities. Meeting our clients’ diverse needs in managing construction risk and generating repeat business from our clients to expand our project base is one of our key growth strategies. We accomplish this objective by providing a broad range of project management consulting services in a wide range of geographic areas that support our clients during every phase of a project, from concept through completion. We believe that nurturing our existing client relationships expands our project base through repeat business.


• | Capitalize Upon the Continued Spend in the Markets We Serve. We believe that the demand for project management services will grow with increasing construction and infrastructure spending in the markets we serve. We believe that our reputation and experience combined with our broad platform of service offerings will enable us to capitalize on increases in demand for our services. In addition, we strategically open new offices to expand into new geographic areas and we aggressively hire individuals with significant contacts to accelerate the growth of these new offices and to strengthen our presence in existing markets.


• | Strengthen Professional Resources. Our biggest asset is the people that work for Hill. We intend to continue spending significant time recruiting and retaining the best and the brightest to improve our competitive position. Our independent status has attracted top project management talent with varied industry experience. We believe maintaining and bolstering our team will enable us to continue to grow our business.

Reporting Segments

The Company operates in a single reporting segment, known as the Project Management Group which provides fee-based construction management services to our clients.
Clients
Our clients consist primarily of the United States federal, state and local governments, other national governments, and the private sector. The following table sets forth our breakdown of revenue attributable to these categories of clients for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:
Revenue By Client Type 

 | 2019 | | 2018
U.S. federal government | $ | 18,967 | | | 5.0 | % | | $ | 16,610 | | | 3.9 | %
U.S. state, regional and local governments | 124,504 | | | 33.1 | % | | 136,904 | | | 31.9 | %
Foreign governments | 91,683 | | | 24.4 | % | | 117,361 | | | 27.4 | %
Private sector | 141,283 | | | 37.5 | % | | 157,804 | | | 36.8 | %
Total | $ | 376,437 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 428,679 | | | 100.0 | %

For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, revenue from U.S. and foreign government contracts represented approximately 62.5% and 63.2% of our total revenue, respectively.
The following table sets forth the percentage of our revenue contributed by each of our five largest clients for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:

 | 2019 | | 2018
Largest client | 3.8 | % | | 6.0 | %
2nd largest client | 3.6 | % | | 5.0 | %
3rd largest client | 3.4 | % | | 4.0 | %
4th largest client | 3.1 | % | | 3.0 | %
5th largest client | 2.6 | % | | 3.0 | %
Top 5 largest clients | 16.5 | % | | 21.0 | %

Business Development

The process for acquiring business from each of our categories of clients is principally the same, by participating in a competitive request-for-proposal (“RFP”) process, with the primary difference among clients being that the process for public sector clients is significantly more formal and complex than for private sector clients as a result of government procurement rules and regulations that govern the public-sector process.

Although a significant factor in our business development consists of our standing in our industry, including existing relationships and reputation based on performance on completed projects, our marketing department undertakes a variety of activities in order to expand our exposure to potential new clients. These activities include media relations, advertising, promotions, market sector initiatives and maintaining our website and related web marketing. Media relations include placing articles that feature us and our personnel in trade publications and other media outlets. Our promotions include arranging speaking engagements for our personnel, participation in trade shows and other promotional activities. Market sector initiatives are designed to broaden our exposure to specific sectors of the construction industry by, for example, participating in or organizing industry seminars.

Doing business with governments is complex and requires the ability to comply with intricate regulations and satisfy periodic audits. We believe that the ability to understand these requirements and to successfully conduct business with government agencies is a barrier to entry for smaller, less experienced competitors. 

We are required from time to time to obtain various permits, licenses and approvals in order to conduct our business in many of the jurisdictions where we operate. Our business of providing project management services is not subject to significant regulation by state, federal or foreign governments.
Contracts
The Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to clients in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for such goods or services.
The price provisions of our client contracts can be grouped into two broad categories: time and materials and fixed price. Under the time and materials (“T&M”) arrangements, contract fees are based upon time and materials incurred. The contracts may be structured as basic time and materials, cost plus a margin or time and materials subject to a maximum contract value (the "cap value"). Under fixed price contracts, the Company’s clients pay an agreed upon amount negotiated in advance for a specified scope of work. The Company is guaranteed to receive the consideration to the extent that the Company delivers under the contract. The Company recognizes revenue over a period of time on fixed price contracts using the input method based upon direct costs incurred to date, which are compared to total projected direct costs. See Note 4 - Revenue from Contracts with Clients in Part II item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," in this Form 10-K for more information.
Consulting Fee Revenue
We believe an important performance measure is consulting fee revenue (“CFR”). The professionals we deploy to execute contracts are occasionally subcontractors. We generally bill our clients the actual cost of these subcontractors and recognize this cost as both revenue and direct expense. CFR refers to our revenue excluding amounts paid or due to subcontractors. We believe CFR is an important measure because it represents the revenue on which we earn gross profit, whereas total revenue includes subcontractors on which we generally pass through the cost and earn minimal or no gross profit.
Backlog

We believe an important indicator of our future performance is our backlog of uncompleted projects under contract or awarded. Our backlog represents management’s estimate of the amount of contracts and awards in-hand that we expect to recognize as CFR in future periods as a component of total revenue. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2019, we excluded backlog from indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ("ID/IQ") contracts in circumstances where the work has not yet been approved by the client. ID/IQ contracts require us to deliver an indefinite amount of service over a pre-determined period of time. Estimated future CFR from ID/IQ contracts is only included in our total backlog if the work has been approved starting in 2019, whereas prior year backlog included estimated CFR from all ID/IQ contracts. Our backlog is evaluated by management on a project-by-project basis and is reported for each period shown based upon the binding nature of the underlying contract, commitment or letter of intent, and other factors, including the economic, financial and regulatory viability of the project and the likelihood of the contract being extended, renewed or canceled.

Our backlog is important to us in anticipating and planning for our operational needs. Backlog is not a measure defined in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"), and our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog.

Although backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations or scope adjustments may occur.  Further, substantially all of our contracts with our clients may be terminated at-will, in which case the client would only be obligated to us for services provided through the termination date.
We adjust backlog to reflect project cancellations, deferrals and revisions in scope and cost (both upward and downward) known at the reporting date. Future contract modifications or cancellations, however, may increase or reduce backlog and future CFR. 
The following tables show our backlog by geographic region as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:

 | Total Backlog | | 12-Month Backlog
As of December 31, 2019 | | | | | | | | | | | 
United States | $ | 371,205 | | | 45.8 | % | | $ | 103,503 | | | 42.0 | %
Latin America | 16,351 | | | 2.0 | % | | 5,068 | | | 2.1 | %
Europe | 90,134 | | | 11.1 | % | | 35,000 | | | 14.2 | %
Middle East | 229,373 | | | 28.3 | % | | 74,846 | | | 30.2 | %
Africa | 86,203 | | | 10.6 | % | | 22,574 | | | 9.2 | %
Asia/Pacific | 17,995 | | | 2.2 | % | | 5,563 | | | 2.3 | %
Total | $ | 811,261 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 246,554 | | | 100.0 | %


 | Total Backlog | | 12-Month Backlog
As of December 31, 2018 | | | | | | | | | | | 
United States | $ | 429,237 | | | 58.0 | % | | 110,012 | | | 42.4 | % 
Latin America | 22,495 | | | 3.0 | % | | 11,871 | | | 4.6 | % 
Europe | 83,974 | | | 11.3 | % | | 32,489 | | | 12.5 | % 
Middle East | 116,913 | | | 15.9 | % | | 71,267 | | | 27.5 | % 
Africa | 69,941 | | | 9.4 | % | | 26,710 | | | 10.3 | % 
Asia/Pacific | 17,713 | | | 2.4 | % | | 7,134 | | | 2.7 | % 
Total | $ | 740,273 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 259,483 | | | 100.0 | %

At December 31, 2019, our backlog was $811,261, compared to $740,273 at December 31, 2018. The increase in backlog is primarily due to the Company being awarded major projects in the Middle East and Africa. Of the total backlog at December 31, 2019, we estimate that 30.4% will be recognized as CFR over the next twelve months based on the backlog table above.
Our 2019 CFR net bookings of $379,608, which excludes cancellations, reductions in contract amounts and other adjustments, equates to a book-to-burn ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019 of 123.0%. Our book-to-burn ratio, a non-GAAP measure, is determined by taking our new CFR bookings and dividing it by CFR for the applicable period. This metric allows management to monitor the Company's business development efforts to ensure we grow our backlog and our business over time, and management believes that this measure is useful to investors for the same reason. 
Our remaining performance obligations represent the aggregate transaction price of executed contracts for projects partially completed or not yet started as of the end of the reporting period. The difference between the remaining performance obligations of $113,592, as described further in Note 4 - Revenue from Contracts with Clients in our consolidated financial statements, and the backlog of $811,261 at December 31, 2019 is due to the backlog including the full value of client contracts billed on a T&M basis, which contracts, are not included as part of the remaining performance obligation. Such contracts are excluded from the remaining performance obligation because they are not fixed price contracts and the consideration expected under such contracts is variable as it is based upon hours and costs incurred, which results in the counter-party only being obligated to the Company for services provided through the completion or termination date. 
Competition

The project management industry is highly competitive. We compete for contracts, primarily on the basis of technical capability, with numerous entities, including other construction management companies, design or engineering firms, general contractors, management consulting firms and other entities. Compared to us, many of these competitors are larger, well-established companies that have broader geographic scope and greater financial and other resources. During 2019, some of our largest project management competitors included: AECOM, ARCADIS N.V., Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., WSP, Turner Construction Co., HNTB, and Dar Group.
Insurance

We maintain insurance covering general and professional liability, involving bodily injury and property damage. We have historically enjoyed a favorable loss ratio in all lines of insurance and our management considers our present limits of liability, deductibles and reserves to be adequate. We endeavor to reduce or eliminate risk through the use of quality assurance/control, risk management, workplace safety and similar methods to eliminate or reduce the risk of losses on a project.
Management
We are led by an experienced management team with significant experience in the construction industry. Additional information about our executive officers follows.
