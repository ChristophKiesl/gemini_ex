BUSINESS
Our Business
TTEC Holdings, Inc. (“TTEC”, “the Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) is a leading global customer experience as a service (“CXaaS”) partner for many of the world’s iconic brands, Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies, and disruptive growth companies. TTEC helps its clients deliver frictionless customer experiences, strengthen customer relationships, brand recognition and loyalty through personalized interactions, improve their Net Promoter Score, customer satisfaction and quality assurance, and lower their total cost to serve by combining innovative digital solutions with best-in-class service capabilities to enable and deliver simplified, consistent and seamless customer experience across channels and phases of the customer lifecycle.
Our CXaaS solutions enhance our clients’ customers experience and help differentiate our clients from their competition. 
In the fast expanding direct-to-customer ("DTC") channel where experiences are everything, enterprises must become increasingly more customer-centric, virtualized and digitally enabled to acquire, grow and maintain customers. Our mission is to enable and accelerate our clients' path to virtual and digital transformation. We are focused on improving the experience of our clients' customers by leveraging existing and emerging technologies — cloud, omnichannel, analytics, artificial intelligence ("AI"), machine learning ("ML"), robotic process automation ("RPA"), and real-time conversational messaging.
The Company reports its financial information based on two segments: TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage.

● | TTEC Digital provides the CX technology services and platforms to support our clients’ customer interaction delivery infrastructure. The segment designs, builds and operates the omnichannel ecosystem in a cloud, on premise, or hybrid environment, inclusive of fully integrating, orchestrating, and administrating highly scalable, feature-rich CX technology applications.

● | TTEC Engage provides the CX managed services to support our clients’ end-to-end customer interaction delivery, by providing the essential CX omnichannel and application technologies, human resources, recruiting, training and production, at-home or facility-based delivery infrastructure on a global scale, and engagement processes. This segment provides full-service digital, omnichannel customer engagement, supporting customer care, customer acquisition, growth and retention, and fraud detection and prevention services.

TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage strategically come together under our unified offering, Humanify® Customer Experience as a Service ("CXaaS"), which drives measurable customer results for clients through the delivery of personalized, omnichannel experiences. Our Humanify® cloud platform provides a fully integrated ecosystem of CX offerings, including messaging, AI, ML, RPA, analytics, cybersecurity, customer relationship management ("CRM"), knowledge management, journey orchestration and traditional voice solutions. Our end-to-end platform differentiates us from many competitors by combining design, strategic consulting, best-in-class technology, data analytics, process optimization, system integration and operational excellence. This unified offering is value-oriented, outcome-based and delivered to large enterprises, governments and disruptive growth companies on a global scale.
During fiscal 2020, the TTEC global operating platform delivered onshore, nearshore and offshore services in 20 countries on six continents -- the United States, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, and the United Kingdom – with the help of 61,000 consultants, technologists, and CX professionals.
Our revenue for fiscal 2020 was $1.949 billion, approximately $307 million, or 16% which came from our TTEC Digital segment and $1.642 billion, or 84%, which came from our TTEC Engage segment.

To improve our competitive position in a rapidly changing market and stay strategically relevant to our clients, we continue to invest in innovation and service offerings for both mainstream and high growth disruptive businesses, diversifying and strengthening our core customer care services with consulting, data analytics, insights, and technology-enabled, outcomes-focused services. 
We also invest to broaden our product and service capabilities, increase our global client base and industry expertise, tailor our geographic footprint to the needs of our clients, and further scale our end-to-end integrated solutions platform. To this end we have been highly acquisitive in the last several years, including an acquisition in the second half of 2020 of a preferred Amazon Connect cloud contact center service provider, an acquisition in the first quarter of 2020 of an autonomous customer experience and intelligent automation solutions provider and an acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2019 of a provider of customer care, social media community management, content moderation, technical support and business process solutions for rapidly growing businesses in early stages of their lifecycle.
We have extensive expertise in the automotive, communications, financial services, national/federal and state and local government, healthcare, logistics, media and entertainment, e-tail/retail, technology, travel and transportation industries. We serve more than 300 diverse clients globally, including many of the world’s iconic brands, Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies, and disruptive growth companies.
Our strong balance sheet, cash flow from operations and access to debt and capital markets have historically provided us the financial flexibility to effectively fund our organic growth, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, incremental investments, and capital distributions. 
We return capital to our shareholders through our dividend program. Given our cash flow generation and balance sheet strength, we believe cash dividends, in balance with our investments in product and service innovations, organic growth, and strategic acquisitions, align shareholder interests with the needs of the Company. After consideration of TTEC’s performance, cash flow from operations, capital needs and the overall liquidity of the Company, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a dividend policy in 2015, with the intent to distribute a periodic cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock. Since inception in 2015, the Company has continued to pay a semi-annual dividend in October and April of each year in gradually increasing amounts from $0.18 to $0.40 per common share. On December 3, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a special one-time dividend of $2.14 per common share, payable on December 30, 2020, to shareholders of record as of December 18, 2020. On February 25, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized a semi-annual dividend of $0.43 per common share, payable on April 21, 2021 to shareholders of record as of April 5, 2021.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Within weeks of this announcement, travel bans, a state of emergency, quarantines, lockdowns, “shelter in place” orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns were issued in most countries where TTEC does business. The need to comply with these measures, which came into effect with little notice, impacted our day-to-day operations and disrupted our business in the last month of the first quarter and second quarter of the year. As a result, operations were suspended in some of our TTEC Engage customer experience delivery sites. Business continuity plans were executed to transition as many employees as was reasonably possible to a work from home environment to support the health and well-being of our employees and communities and to provide a stable service delivery platform for our clients.
Between mid-March and mid-April 2020, we transitioned over 43,000 employees, or 80% of our employee population, to a work from home environment. With the easing of some of the government restrictions, those employees who were considered essential and could not operate effectively while remote returned to our brick-and-mortar sites, but most continue to work from home.
For those sites that continue to operate, we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, in accordance with the recommendations and guidelines provided by the World Health Organization, the U.S. and European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Occupational Safety Association, and local governments in jurisdictions where our customer experience centers are located.

Although our business experienced the effects of COVID-19 in the first half of 2020, our implementation of business continuity plans, rapid transition of employees to a work from home environment, and the geographic diversification of our delivery centers allowed us to mitigate potentially more severe impacts, and positioned us to support our commercial and public sector clients experiencing significant surge volumes of customer, patient and citizen COVID-19 related engagement. Our COVID-19 related surge work has contributed approximately 12% of our total revenue for 2020. Although approximately 20% of our pre-COVID-19 business was comprised of clients in industries that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic, i.e. automotive, retail and travel and hospitality, the 2020 total revenue derived from these clients has increased approximately 10% over the prior year period. Through the period ended December 31, 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our operational or financial results. While we expect this positive trend to continue and while some of our COVID-19 related work has transitioned to more traditional business activities for the same clients, there is uncertainty about our COVID-19 surge volumes and our non-COVID-19 related business. We cannot accurately predict the severity of the economic and operational challenges of a pro-longed COVID-19 pandemic on our clients’ businesses and its effect on the magnitude and timing of their buying decisions. Further, while to date we have been successful in managing service delivery from our delivery sites that could not be replaced with work from home delivery, unpredictable lockdown decisions in some jurisdictions where we do business may continue to impact our delivery capability with little notice, thus potentially impacting our results of operations in the future.
In March 2020, we launched multiple cost reduction, optimization, and liquidity preservation initiatives to align our expenses with anticipated changes in revenue and increased costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and government mandated restriction measures. We also intensified our cash flow discipline, including working capital management, hiring freezes, cuts in non-essential spending, suspension of merit increases and some incentive programs, deferral of capital expenditures, where possible, and negotiations for rent concessions for those facilities that we were unable to use during the government restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results of operations for 2020 permitted us to reverse most of the cost austerity measures. With the greater adoption of our work from home solution during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also launched a comprehensive review of our global real estate footprint to balance our commitments to physical facilities around the globe against evolving client preferences with respect to traditional physical delivery centers and work from home delivery. Considering the continued COVID-19 related uncertainties, we continue to remain vigilant in our cost management.
Our Industry – Key Emerging Themes

● | Accelerated Digital and Virtual Transformation – Before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading organizations were already transforming to a more digitized, virtualized future. The pandemic and related impacts on access to products and services and how organizations manage their customer interactions, exposed significant customer interaction technology and delivery deficiencies for many organizations across the world that were not digitized or agile enough to adequately support their customers. Organizations’ front-line operations and customer support infrastructure were too brick-and-mortar focused with limited non-voice digital customer interaction alternatives. Organizations are recognizing the growing importance for increased virtual delivery solutions and expanded and enhanced digital omnichannel capabilities. This development is expected to create accelerated demand for our demonstrated suite of CX product and service offerings to enable and support this transformation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct-to-Consumer (“DTC”) Revolution - The DTC revolution has created a new generation of disruptive brands with few barriers to entry. These emerging brands thrive on emotional connection and authentic customer relationships relying on trusted influencers and personalized service to win the hearts and minds of a growing customer base, one that requires an on-demand, curated buying experience. We believe DTC can enhance the value we provide to our clients as we design, build and operate our clients’ digital customer experience.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Evolution of Customer Behavior and CX Imperative - Yesterday's customer service experience is being replaced by today's direct experience, where brands deliver a personalized end-to-end journey. As customers become more connected and share their experiences across a variety of social channels, the quality of the experience has a greater impact on brand loyalty and business performance. Customers are increasingly shaping their attitudes, behaviors and willingness to recommend or stay with a brand based on the totality of their experience, including not only the superiority of the product or service, but also the quality of their ongoing service and support interactions. Given the strong correlation between high customer satisfaction and improved profitability, companies are increasingly focused on selecting partners who can deliver an integrated, insights-driven strategy, service and technology solution that increases the lifetime value of a customer.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | CX Technology is Migrating to the Cloud - Cloud investment is expected to continue to grow significantly. The adoption of cloud technology to deliver omnichannel and other customer experience technology is still in its infancy. Our clients are embracing cloud-based CX technology solutions in a manner similar to how they seek cost-effective architecture and rapid deployment across other parts of their operations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enterprises are Consolidating Partners - An increasing percentage of companies are consolidating their customer engagement wallet with a few select partners who can deliver measurable business outcomes by offering an integrated, technology-enabled solution. Companies will continue to consolidate with partners like TTEC that have demonstrated expertise in increasing brand value by delivering holistic, integrated customer-centric solutions spanning the entire customer experience journey, instead of inefficiently linking together a series of multiple point solutions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | CX Delivery Shifting from Brick-and-Mortar to Work From Home – COVID-19 accelerated the shift of customer experience delivery from brick-and-mortar to work from home. While we expect a portion of work from home delivery to shift back to brick-and-mortar post-pandemic, a higher portion of delivery will remain in work from home locations than pre-pandemic.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clients
We develop long-term relationships with clients globally, including many of the worlds’ iconic brands, Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies, and disruptive growth companies. These organizations are in customer intensive industries or sectors, whose complexities and customer focus requires a partner that can quickly design and build integrated technology and data-enabled services, often on a global scale. In 2020, our top five and ten clients represented 40% and 53% of total revenue, respectively. 

6



In several of our offerings across TTEC Digital and TTEC Engage, we enter into long-term relationships that provide us with a more predictable recurring revenue stream. In our TTEC Digital segment, our CX cloud and managed services technology solution contracts have an average three-year term with penalties in the case a client terminates for convenience. In our TTEC Engage segment, most of our contracts can be terminated for convenience by either party, but our relationships with our top five clients have ranged from 14 to 21 years including multiple programs and contract renewals for several of these clients. In 2020, we had a 111% revenue retention rate for the TTEC Engage segment, versus 102% in 2019.
Certain of our communications clients provide us with telecommunication services through arm’s length negotiated transactions. These clients currently represent approximately 8% of our total annual revenue. Expenditures under these supplier contracts represent less than one percent of our total operating costs.
Competition
We are a leading global customer experience technology and services partner for many of the world’s most iconic brands, Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies, and disruptive growth companies. Our competitors vary by geography and business segment, and range from large multinational corporations to smaller, narrowly focused enterprises. Across our lines of business, the principal competitive factors include: client relationships, technology and process innovation, integrated solutions, digital and virtual delivery capabilities, operational performance and efficiencies, pricing, brand recognition and financial strength.
Our strategy in maintaining market leadership is to invest, innovate and provide integrated value-driven services, all centered around customer engagement management. Today, we are executing on a more expansive, holistic strategy by transforming our business into higher-value offerings through organic investments and strategic acquisitions. As we execute, we are differentiating ourselves in the marketplace and entering new markets that introduce us to an expanded competitive landscape.
In our TTEC Digital segment, we primarily compete with smaller pure play technology and service providers and divisions of multinational companies, including Five9, LivePerson, 8x8, InContact, Twilio, EPAM, Endava, Globant, GlobalLogic, Accenture, Cognizant, Infosys, among others.

Research, Innovation, Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technology
We recognize the value of innovation in our business and are committed to developing leading-edge technologies and proprietary solutions. Research and innovation have been a major factor in our success and we believe that they will continue to contribute to our growth in the future. We use our investment in research and development to create, commercialize and deploy innovative business strategies and high-value technology solutions.
We deliver value to our clients through, and our success in part depends on, certain proprietary technologies and methodologies. We leverage U.S. and foreign patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws as well as confidentiality, proprietary information non-disclosure agreements, and key staff non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary technology.

Human Capital Resources
Headcount Information: As of December 31, 2020, TTEC had 61,000 employees, approximately 1,300 of whom are CX professionals serving TTEC Digital clients and approximately 59,700 of whom serve TTEC Engage clients. Approximately 46% of TTEC employees are located in the United States, 38% are based in Asia-Pacific region, 8% are located in Central and South America, 4% are based in India, and 3% are based in Europe, Middle East and Africa and 1% are based in Canada. After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter of 2020, we have seen a rapid growth of our employee population in the United States. Between the start of the second quarter and end of fiscal year 2020, our U.S. based employee population increased from 17,000 to 27,900 with most employees working remotely.
Development and Training: The attraction, development and retention of our employees is important to TTEC’s success. To support advancement of our employees and prepare them for demands of rapidly changing workplace and client requirements we offer an extensive career focused curriculum. The pressures of COVID-19 pandemic notwithstanding, in 2020 we made significant investments in our talent management platform, TTEC University, that includes a library of more than 8,000 courses that cover topics important to general business acumen ranging from business operations, leadership, ethics, finance, negotiations, and project management to subject-matter specific professional and technical curriculum. TTEC development programs help identify top performers, improve employee retention, and create promotion-from-within opportunities in the Company. In 2020, TTEC launched the Talent Accelerator Program (“TAP”) designed to identify and attract new talent and prepare them for success within our organization. The program recruits recently graduated candidates with diverse backgrounds ranging for technology to humanities who undergo a three-year specialized training and rotation through all business functions and segments in our organization. Program participants gain experience in finance, risk, human capital, IT, communication, marketing, sales, and operations, becoming fully immersed in the day-to-day operations of the business. Once the program is completed, the TAP participants will be equipped with knowledge and experience necessary to progress as a manager in the Company.
Diversity & Inclusion: TTEC believes that our culture of diversity and inclusion enables us to create, develop and leverage the strengths of our employee population to align with our client expectations and enable the Company’s growth objectives. To achieve our objectives, TTEC formed the Diversity Council that combines representatives from TTEC’s different business segments and geographies who bring a diverse mix of backgrounds and perspectives. The Diversity Council includes special affinity groups representation such as Women in Leadership and Black Leadership Council to help unify us and make us stronger as one team.
Our Diversity Council is a critical driver in fostering organizational change, establishing a dedicated focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion priorities identifying best practices and new opportunities, increasing awareness and education, providing leadership opportunities within TTEC to traditionally underrepresented employees, as well as holding the organization accountable in driving a culture that realizes TTEC’s vision of ‘bringing humanity to business’. The Company has adopted several metrics that focus on ensuring accountability for progress in diversity. The CEO, members of TTEC executive leadership team and other senior leaders have diversity and inclusion objectives embedded in their annual performance goals. As of December 31, 2020, 59% of the Company’s global workforce was female and 51% of employees in supervisory roles were female. As of December 31, 2020, 54% of the U.S. workforce were people of color and 34% of employees in supervisory roles were people of color. 
Competitive Pay/Benefits and Pay for Performance Philosophy: TTEC compensation programs are designed to align compensation of our employees to market, and to provide appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve exceptional results for our clients and our shareholders. Our pay-for-performance philosophy aligns our compensation with TTEC’s performance and with the returns that our stockholders receive from their investment in the Company. Further, TTEC provides employees with a comprehensive benefits program that includes nicotine abatement, mental health initiatives, and overall wellness programs to support employees’ physical, emotional, and financial health.

Workplace Safety: The health and safety of our employees is one of our highest priorities. Our business’s success depends on protecting our employees, visitors, clients and facilities, and we rely on our employees to help us meet our safety and security standards. TTEC employees are required to complete health and safety training when they join the Company and they are encouraged to report any concerns about safety in their work environment. This employee empowerment initiative launched in 2018 and the shift to working from home during the pandemic, lead to a reduction to our injuries at work of approximately 65% by year end 2020. 
Our commitment to safety was more important than ever in 2020 when we had to change how we work to address COVID-19 pandemic. We took rapid measures across our business segments and geographies to transition most of our employees to a work from home environment. For the sites that provided essential services and had to remain operational during the pandemic, we invested approximately $5.6 million into enhanced sanitation and safety protocols including increased cleaning frequency, added signage and workstation reconfiguration for social distancing, personal protective equipment, contact tracing, shuttle services, and automated health attestations.
Retention and Turnover: At TTEC, our employees are at the core of everything we do, and our people strategy centers around their experience as part of our team. Since TTEC Engage segment of our business is people intensive, retention and reduction in turnover is a priority important to the financial results of our operations. Our turnover reduction efforts focus on market pay, trained management teams, development programs, career mobility, communication and the work environment and company culture that make an employee feel engaged, rewarded, appreciated, informed, and fulfilled in the organization. 
Employee Engagement: To assess and improve employee engagement, we conduct annual employee pulse and Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) surveys. We take action to address areas of employee concerns raised in the surveys and reinforce activities that employees tell us encourage them to stay with the Company and recommend the Company as an employer of choice to others. In recent years, approximately 35,000 employees completed our employee NPS survey. TTEC’s overall employee engagement score exceeded Gallup’s reported best in-class ratings.
