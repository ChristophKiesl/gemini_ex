ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Volt Information Sciences, Inc. (the “Company” or “Volt”) is a global provider of staffing services (traditional time and materials-based as well as project-based). Our staffing services consist of workforce solutions that include providing contingent workers, personnel recruitment services and managed staffing services programs supporting primarily administrative and light industrial (commercial) as well as technical, information technology and engineering (professional) positions. Our managed service programs (“MSP”) involve managing the procurement and on-boarding of contingent workers from multiple providers. Through June 2019, when we exited this business, our customer care solutions business specialized in serving as an extension of our customers’ consumer relationships and processes including collaborating with customers, from help desk inquiries to advanced technical support. 
 The Company was incorporated in New York in 1957. Unless the context otherwise requires, throughout this report, the words “Volt,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Volt Information Sciences, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Geographic Regions and Segments
Volt operates in approximately 60 of its own locations and has an on-site presence in over 50 customer locations. Approximately 88% of our revenue is generated in the United States where we have employees in nearly all 50 states. Our principal non-U.S. markets include Europe, Asia Pacific and Canada locations. Our global footprint enables us to deliver consistent quality to our large strategic customers that require an established international presence.
Our reportable segments are (i) North American Staffing, (ii) International Staffing and (iii) North American MSP. All other business activities that do not meet the criteria to be reportable segments are aggregated with corporate services under the category Corporate and Other. Our reportable segments have been determined in accordance with our internal management structure, which is based on operating activities. We evaluate business performance based upon several metrics, primarily using revenue and segment operating income as the relevant financial measures. We believe segment operating income provides management and investors a measure to analyze operating performance of each business segment against historical and competitors’ data, although historical results, including operating income, may not be indicative of future results as operating income is highly contingent on many factors including the state of the economy, competitive conditions and customer preferences. 
We allocate all support-related costs to the operating segments except for costs not directly relating to our operating activities such as corporate-wide general and administrative costs. These costs are not allocated to individual operating segments because doing so would not enhance the understanding of segment operating performance and such costs are not used by management to measure segment performance.
We report our segment information in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting (“ASC 280”). See Note 18, “Segment Disclosures” for further information. 
In June 2019, the Company exited its customer care solutions business, which is currently reported as a part of the Corporate and Other category. This exit allowed the Company to further strengthen its focus on its core staffing business and align its resources to streamline operations, improve cost competitiveness and increase profitability. The Company’s other non-reportable businesses will continue to be combined and disclosed with corporate services under the category Corporate and Other.
Description of the Reportable Segments and Corporate and Other Category
North American and International Staffing Segments
Our two staffing services segments provide workforce management expertise through locations in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific locations. We deliver a broad spectrum of contingent staffing, direct placement, staffing management and other employment services. Our contingent workers are placed on assignment with our customers in a broad range of occupations including manufacturing, assembly, warehousing, industrial, information technology, engineering, pharmaceutical, administrative, call center, accounting and finance.
Our contingent staffing services are provided for varying periods of time to companies and other organizations (including government agencies) ranging from smaller retail accounts that may require ten or fewer contingent workers at a time to large 
strategic accounts that require as many as several thousand contingent workers at a time. Our large strategic accounts typically enter into longer term agreements with us resulting in lower direct margins compared to our retail accounts.
Within our staffing services segments, we refer to customers that require multi-location, coordinated account management and service delivery in multiple skill sets as strategic customers and to customers that are primarily in a single location with sales and delivery handled primarily from a geographically local team and with relatively few headcount on assignment in one or two skill sets as retail customers. We provide traditional staffing services for which we are paid predominantly on a time and materials basis. The contingent staff that we provide often work under the supervision of our customers.
Volt’s contingent staffing services enable customers to easily scale their workforce to meet changing business conditions, complete a specific project, secure the services of a specialist on an as-needed basis, substitute for regular employees during vacation or other temporary absences, staff high turnover positions, or meet seasonal peaks in workforce needs. When requested, we also provide Volt personnel at the customer’s location to coordinate and manage the administration of contingent workers. Many customers rely on Volt’s staffing services as a strategic element of their overall workforce, allowing them to more efficiently meet their fluctuating staffing requirements.
Contingent workers are recruited through proprietary internet recruiting sites, independent web-based job search companies and social networking talent communities through which we build and maintain proprietary databases of candidates from which we can fill current and future customer needs. The majority of contingent workers become Volt employees during the period of their assignment and we are responsible for the payment of wages, payroll taxes, workers’ compensation insurance, unemployment insurance and other benefits. Customers will sometimes hire Volt’s contingent workers as their own employees after a period of time, for which we usually receive a fee.
We also provide recruitment and direct placement services of specialists in the accounting, finance, administrative, call center, engineering, information technology, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, assembly and industrial support disciplines. These services are primarily provided on a contingency basis with fees earned only if our customers ultimately hire the candidates.
North American MSP Segment
Our North American MSP segment consists of managing the procurement and on-boarding of contingent workers and a broad range of specialized solutions that includes managing suppliers and providing sourcing and recruiting support, statement of work management, supplier performance measurement, optimization and analysis, benchmarking of spend demographics and market rate analysis, consolidated customer billing and supplier payment management. The workforce placed on assignment through our MSPs is usually provided by third-party staffing providers (“associate vendors”) or through our own staffing services. In most cases, we are only required to pay associate vendors after we receive payment from our customer. Our staffing services businesses also act as a subcontractor or associate vendor to other national providers in their MSPs. Our MSPs are typically administered through the use of vendor management system software (“VMS”) licensed from various VMS providers.
In addition, our North American MSP segment provides payroll service solutions as well as recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) for our customers. With our payroll service solution (also known as referred services), the customer refers an individual to us, we employ the individual and the individual works on an assignment for the customer at the customer’s worksite. We manage and administer the individual’s payroll, payroll taxes, workers’ compensation and benefits. 
Corporate and Other Category
Our Corporate and Other category consists of our corporate services and remote hire services business in India, as well as our customer care solutions business through June 2019.
Our corporate services provide entity-wide general and administrative functions that support all of our segments.
Our remote hire services business in India provides skilled resources, technical infrastructure and management for various areas including back-office accounting and administration, as well as software development, engineering, web design, technical support, call center operations, sales and marketing, customer service and research.
Business Strategy 
Strategic Priorities
We have built a leadership team of prominent staffing industry veterans to strengthen our sales leadership team with a focus on our sales strategy to enhance financial performance and build a foundation for sustainable growth. This strategy includes the following priorities:
•Organizational Design - To strengthen the focus on sales and delivery performance across a spectrum of service offerings for maximum competitive advantage, we formed the Specialty Solutions Group, Strategic Solutions Group and Global Solutions Group. This design allows Volt to steer its “go-to-market” strategy and performance based on a specialized job segment view as well as transform its delivery models to achieve dedicated focus, enhanced agility for customers’ needs and low-cost delivery benefits. 
•Delivery Excellence - Improve talent acquisition and delivery with a more focused, customized, agile delivery approach by integrating recruiting tools to increase our speed to match candidates and to mobilize data analytics to drive strategy around job postings and return on investments. This initiative will continue to evolve based on the needs of our clients and the expectations of candidates in the market.
•Business Optimization - Drive further efficiencies, productivity and cost savings by optimizing technology to drive performance through increased integration of available digital tools, reporting and processes and migrating from manual, customized processes to automated, standard processes. These enhancements should yield meaningful cost savings, a portion of which can then be re-invested into important recruiting and candidate acquisition resources. 
•Growth and Expansion - Achieve revenue and margin growth with new and existing client relationships, through realigned sales and delivery efforts. We are re-establishing our sales culture by realigning the sales teams based upon client buying patterns with an emphasis on building client relationships. To further incentivize growth within the sales teams, we overhauled our bonus plans to align with a ‘pay for performance’ structure and we have introduced a higher level of visibility and accountability into the sales culture. 
Customers
The Company serves multinational, national and local customers, providing staffing services (traditional time and materials-based as well as project-based) and managed service programs (as well as customer care solutions through June 2019). The Company had no single customer that accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2020 or 2019. Our top 10 customers, which are not the same in each year, represented approximately 41% and 39% of revenue in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The loss of one or more of these customers, unless the business is replaced, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.
In fiscal 2020, the International Staffing segment’s revenue included two customers which accounted for approximately 24% and 12% of the total revenue of that segment. The North American MSP segment’s revenue included four customers which accounted for approximately 22%, 14%, 12% and 10% of the total revenue of that segment.
In fiscal 2019, the International Staffing segment’s revenue included three customers which accounted for approximately 15%, 13% and 11% of the total revenue of that segment. The North American MSP segment’s revenue included two customers which accounted for approximately 24% and 11% of the total revenue of that segment.
In both fiscal 2020 and 2019, 88% of our total revenue was from customers in the United States. 
Competition
The markets for Volt's staffing services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry. The industry is large and fragmented, comprised of thousands of firms employing millions of people and generating billions of dollars in annual revenue. In most areas, no single company has a dominant share of the employment services market. The largest companies in the industry collectively represent less than half of all staffing services revenues and there are many smaller companies competing in varying degrees at local levels or in particular market sectors. Dominant leaders in the industry include Adecco, Allegis, Kelly Services, Inc., Manpower Group and Randstad.
In addition, there are numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate. Companies in our industries primarily compete on price, service quality, new capabilities and technologies, marketing methods and speed of fulfilling assignments.
Intellectual Property
VOLT is the principal registered trademark for our brand in the United States. ARCTERN, REMOTEHIRE and VOLTSOURCE are other registered trademarks in the United States. The Company also owns and uses common law trademarks and service marks.
We also own copyrights and license technology from many providers. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad to protect our brand and proprietary information.
Seasonality
Our staffing services revenue and operating income are typically lowest in our first fiscal quarter due to the holiday season and are affected by customer facility closures during the holidays (in some cases for up to two weeks) and closures caused by severe weather conditions. The demand for our staffing services typically increases during our third and fourth fiscal quarters when customers increase the use of our administrative and industrial labor during the summer vacation period. The first few months of the calendar year typically have the lowest margins as employer payroll tax contributions restart each year in January. Margins typically increase in subsequent fiscal quarters as annual payroll tax contribution maximums are met, particularly for higher salaried employees.
Employees and Human Capital Resource Management 
Volt operates on the fundamental philosophy that people are our most valuable asset as every person who works for us has the potential to impact our success as well as the success of our clients. As a staffing company, identifying quality talent is at the core of everything we do and our success is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified employees, both in-house and for our clients. The Company’s core values of integrity, customer centric, ownership, innovation, empowerment, collaborative change and teamwork establish the foundation on which the culture is built and represent the key expectations we have of our employees. We believe our culture and commitment to our employees attract and retain our qualified talent, while simultaneously providing significant value to our Company and its shareholders.
Demographics
As of November 1, 2020, Volt employed approximately 15,600 people, including approximately 14,500 who were on contingent staffing assignments with our clients, and the remainder as full-time in-house employees. The workers on contingent staffing assignments are on our payroll for the length of their assignment with the client. 
Diversity and Inclusion 
Volt values building diverse teams, embracing different perspectives and fostering an inclusive, empowering work environment for our employees and clients. We have a long-standing commitment to equal employment opportunity as evidenced by the Company’s EEO policy. Of our in house employee population, approximately 70% are women and approximately 40% have self-identified as Hispanic or Latino, Native American, Pacific Islander, Asian, Black or African American, or of two or more races. As part of Volt’s commitment to continued enhancements in this area, we recently launched our Expert Momentum Diversity and Inclusion Program. This program involved the creation of a task force made up of a group of employees from across the organization. The program has established initiatives to strengthen the promotion of workplace diversity for our employees and clients, to create a collaborative environment that promotes authenticity and a culture that celebrates our differences, and embraces a collaborative environment with unique experiences and diverse perspectives. The program’s task force will enhance company-wide engagement on diversity and inclusion, provide education opportunities for our employees, help identify areas for improvement and monitor progress against these initiatives. 
Compensation and Benefits 
Critical to our success is identifying, recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing our existing and future employees. We strive to attract and retain the most talented employees in the industry by offering competitive compensation and benefits. Our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy is based on rewarding each employee’s individual contributions and striving to achieve equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. We use a combination of fixed and variable pay including base 
salary, bonus, commissions and merit increases which vary across the business. In addition as part of our long-term incentive plan for executives and certain employees, we provide share-based compensation to foster our pay-for-performance culture and to attract, retain and motivate our key leaders. 
As the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people, we offer benefits that support their physical, financial and emotional well-being. We provide our employees with access to flexible and convenient medical programs intended to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In addition to standard medical coverage, we offer eligible employees dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, employee assistance programs, voluntary short-term and long-term disability insurance and term life insurance. Additionally, we offer a 401(k) Savings Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan to certain employees. Our benefits vary by location and are designed to meet or exceed local laws and to be competitive in the marketplace. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, government legislation and key authorities, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate. This included having the majority of our employees work from home for several months, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. We continue to embrace a flexible working arrangement for a majority of our in-house employees, as well as a portion of our contingent workforce where we continue to provide key services to customers remotely.
Commitment to Values and Ethics
Along with our core values, we act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”), which sets forth expectations and guidance for employees to make appropriate decisions. Our Code of Conduct covers topics such as anti-corruption, discrimination, harassment, privacy, appropriate use of company assets, protecting confidential information, and reporting Code of Conduct violations. The Code of Conduct reflects our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and also provides direction for reporting complaints in the event of alleged violations of our policies (including through an anonymous hotline). Our executive officers and supervisors maintain “open door” policies and any form of retaliation is strictly prohibited. 
Professional Development and Training
We believe a key factor in employee retention is training and professional development for our talent. We have training programs across all levels of the Company to meet the needs of various roles, specialized skill sets and departments across the Company. We provide compliance education as well as general workplace safety training to our contingent employees and offer OSHA training to key employees and clients. Volt is committed to the security and confidentiality of our employees’ personal information and employs software tools and periodic employee training programs to promote security and information protection at all levels. We utilize certain employee turnover rates and productivity metrics in assessing our employee programs to ensure that they are structured to instill high levels of in-house employee tenure, low levels of voluntary turnover and the optimization of productivity and performance across our entire workforce. Additionally, we have implemented a new performance evaluation program which adopts a modern approach to valuing and strengthening individual performance through on-going interactive progress assessments related to established goals and objectives.
Communication and Engagement 
We strongly believe that Volt’s success depends on employees understanding how their work contributes to the Company’s overall strategy. To this end, we communicate with our workforce through a variety of channels and encourage open and direct communication, including: (i) quarterly company-wide CEO update calls; (ii) regular company-wide calls with executives; (iii) frequent email corporate communications and (iv) employee engagement surveys.
Regulation
Some states in the United States and certain foreign countries license and regulate contingent staffing service firms and employment agencies. Compliance with applicable present federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations has not had, and we believe that compliance with those laws and regulations in the future will not have, a material effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
