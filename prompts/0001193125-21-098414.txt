Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing our proprietary technology to harness the power of the immune system to combat cancer. Our product candidate, CMP-001, is an advanced generation Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist delivered as a biologic virus-like particle (VLP) utilizing a CpG-A oligonucleotide as a key component. When injected into a tumor, CMP-001 is designed to trigger the bodys innate immune system, thereby altering the tumor microenvironment and directing activated anti-tumor T cells to attack both the injected tumor and also tumors throughout the body. In a clinical trial of CMP-001 in combination with a systemic checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) in patients with melanoma whose tumors were unresponsive or no longer responsive to a CPI, we have observed a best objective response rate (ORR) of 28% (27/98), including post-progression responders. We have assembled a strong management team and infrastructure to evaluate CMP-001 across multiple tumor types in combination with other immunotherapy agents. Our founder, Art Krieg, first reported the discovery of immunostimulatory cytosine-phosphate-guanine(CpG) DNA in 1995, which, combined with the discovery of TLR9, led to the recognition that synthetic CpG-A oligonucleotides have the ability to stimulate the TLR9 receptor for therapeutic purposes. Our goal is to establish CMP-001 as a foundational immuno-oncology therapy that engages the innate immune system to fight cancer and improve outcomes for patients with a broad range of solid tumors. 
 Many tumors possess mechanisms to evade the immune system. One such evasion mechanism is through the expression of signaling molecules known as immune checkpoint proteins, which inhibit some immune cells that are capable of mounting an immune response against the tumor. Checkpoint inhibitors, such as antibodies that block programmed death receptor 1 ( PD-1) have the ability to reverse this mechanism of evasion, thereby unleashing anti-tumor T cells to destroy tumors. However, except with respect to certain rare tumor types, these therapies are only effective in a minority of patients, as many patients do not have an activated T cell response targeting their tumors. We have observed increased anti-tumor T cell activity in preclinical and clinical studies of the combination of a CPI with an innate immune activator of Type I interferons (IFN-α) a large subgroup of interferon proteins that help regulate the immune system. Of the many different IFN-α inducers that have been tested in human immune cells, TLR9 agonist CpG-A oligonucleotides have been found to be the most potent in inducing IFN-α. We believe that the distinct mechanism of action of CMP-001, along with its structure as a VLP, leads to the activation of innate immunity in a way that initiates or restores a systemic adaptive immune response with anti-tumor T cells. 
 Our top priorities are to (1) Advance the clinical development of CMP-001 toward marketing authorizations for the treatment of melanoma, and (2) Develop CMP-001 for use across other relevant tumor types and indications. We are conducting a Phase 2 trial of CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab in anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma. We believe that data from this trial, if successful, could help support submission of a biologics license application (BLA). Additionally, we are conducting a randomized Phase 2 trial of CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab in first-line melanoma. In addition to these studies in melanoma, we are conducting a study of CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab in relapsed / refractory metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and actively exploring potential trials in other tumor types. 
 Our Phase 1b clinical study has evaluated CMP-001 in subjects with advanced anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma in combination with pembrolizumab and as a monotherapy. In this study, as of September 30, 2020, we observed a best ORR of 28% (27/98), including post-progression responders, when CMP-001 was combined with pembrolizumab. Treatment related adverse events were generally manageable, the most common consisting of flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions.

 We are also supporting an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 trial with CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab in the pre-surgery, or neoadjuvant, setting in patients with resectable melanoma not previously treated with PD-1 blockade. Data presented at The Society for the Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) on November 11, 2020 showed a Pathological Response (pCR, pMR, and pPR) of 70%, a pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate of 50%, and a Major Pathological Response (MPR) (pCR and pMR), rate of 60%. We believe these pathological response rates in the neoadjuvant setting support the development of CMP-001 in other anti-PD-1 naïve melanoma indications, such as first-line melanoma, which we are pursuing in a clinical trial. Historical response rates of other TLR9 agonists in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies in the anti-PD-1 naïve metastatic or unresectable melanoma setting have shown objective response rates ranging from 49 to 76% as compared to an average of only 34 to 40% with PD-1 therapy alone. We expect that we will be required to conduct a randomized trial comparing CMP-001 in combination with PD-1 blockade versus PD-1 blockade alone if we pursue marketing authorization in the future in neoadjuvant melanoma. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) has granted CMP-001as a TLR9 agonist Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of Stages IIb-IV melanoma and Fast Track designation for unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma and unresectable or metastatic melanoma refractory to prior anti-PD-1 blockaded. 
 To date, CMP-001 has been studied in more than 250 melanoma patients in clinical trials. Based on the clinical data we have generated to date, including the generally manageable adverse events we have observed, we believe there is an opportunity for CMP-001 to be developed as a differentiated immuno-oncology therapy. On the strength of the clinical results observed in multiple settings of melanoma, we intend to conduct additional trials with CMP-001 in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies. The following table sets forth the current status of our existing trials and our key clinical trials evaluating CMP-001 in melanoma as well as our expansion into new indications with our trial in HNSCC. 
 Clinical Pipeline 
 


We believe that our novel mechanism of action creates significant potential to synergize with CPIs in two unique ways: (1) through the Type A class of CpG molecule, and (2) through the immunostimulatory effects of the VLP. To our knowledge, CMP-001 is the only investigational CpG-A class TLR9 agonist in clinical trials, and we believe the CpG-A class differs from other CpG classes in clinical development in their ability induce high levels of IFN-α. CpG-A oligonucleotides contain a native phosphodiester DNA backbone that is cleaved during TLR9 activation in order to generate the strongest possible IFN-α production. In contrast, CpG-B and CpG-C oligonucleotides, used in other TLR9 clinical studies, consist of TLR9 agonists constructed with a phosphorothioate backbone that cannot be cleaved during plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) activation, and therefore induce a lower level of IFN-α production. We believe the differences in molecular structure have a meaningful impact on molecular signaling, and potentially on clinical efficacy. CpG-A activates TLR9 in early endosomes, which is in turn associated with high IFN-α production.

 Our VLP technology is designed to encapsulate and protect the CpG-A oligonucleotide from degradation in the tumor. The first injection of the VLP stimulates the production of antibodies to the VLP. On subsequent injections, the antibodies may then bind to the VLP, potentially promoting the uptake of the CpG-A cargo into the pDCs via an activating receptor on the pDCs, FcgRIIA, which has been shown in pre-clinical models to enhance the systemic anti-cancer immune effect. In contrast, CpG-B and CpG-C oligonucleotides are taken up via oligonucleotide receptors without this added immune effect from the FcgRIIA. We believe this is another important differentiating factor in the efficacy of our approach. 
 We believe our VLP technology confers unique properties that enhance therapeutic immune stimulation. We plan to explore the applicability of our VLP technology as we pursue other innate immune targets beyond TLR9. In addition to our internal drug discovery and development efforts, we plan to explore potential strategic collaborative relationships, partnerships, acquisitions and licensing opportunities to enhance the development of our current programs and access additional novel product candidates. 
 To support our business efforts, we have assembled a management team with extensive experience in pharmaceutical and biologic discovery, development and commercialization at leading biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies including Biogen, Coley, Human Genome Sciences, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Pfizer, Takeda, Moderna and Amgen. Since our inception in 2015, through venture funding and our IPO in August 2020, we have raised $241.7 million. Our private rounds included prominent biotechnology institutional investors including Sofinnova Investments, venBio Partners, F-Prime Capital, Decheng Capital, Longitude Capital, Novo Holdings, Medixci, Omega Funds, Clough Capital Partners, Sectoral Asset Management, and BrightEdge, the venture investment fund of the American Cancer Society. 
 Our CMP-001 Program 
 CMP-001 is based on a novel therapeutic approach that consists of two components: (1) a capsid protein that is produced by fermentation, and is derived from a QBeta RNA bacteriophage and (2) a CpG-A DNA oligonucleotide that is manufactured by solid phase synthesis. These two components are combined together under controlled conditions where they self-assemble to form the VLP. 
 To date, CMP-001 is the only CpG-A oligodeoxynucleotide in clinical development to our knowledge and is differentiated in several important ways from other TLR9 agonists in advanced clinical development, which are CpG-C oligodeoxynucleotides. We believe these differences have resulted in encouraging and differentiated clinical data. 
 First, CpG-A oligodeoxynucleotides are structurally distinct from CpG-C oligodeoxynucleotides, and they induce higher levels of IFN-α. In contrast, CpG-C oligodeoxynucleotides induced less IFN-α and more inflammatory cytokines and Interleukin-10 (IL-10), a key immune-suppressive cytokine produced by regulatory T-cells, when evaluated in pre-clinical models. Second, the CpG-A in CMP-001 is packaged in an immunogenic virus-like particle (VLP). A facilitating antibody response develops to the VLP, which is taken up by the target cells (plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or pDCs) through a specific receptor, FcgRIIA (CD32), that provides an additional positive signal to the pDC. In animal models, delivery via the VLP has enhanced the regression of non-injected, distant tumors. 
 We believe that the clinical data we have generated with CMP-001, both in monotherapy and in combination with PD-1 blockade, demonstrate compelling proof-of-concept consistent with the distinct molecular structure. In combination with pembrolizumab in patients with PD-1 refractory melanoma, the ORR was 23% (23/98) by RECIST v1.1, and 28% (27/98) when including post-progression responses. The median duration of response was 19.9 months. Furthermore, we believe that CMP-001 is the only TLR9 agonist to date to demonstrate compelling evidence of single-agent activity, despite the modest duration of response. Finally, we believe CMP-001 is the only TLR9 agonist to date to demonstrate compelling activity in combination with PD-1 blockade in patients with high-risk, Stage III neoadjuvant melanoma.

 Based upon the totality of the data generated to date, we are developing CMP-001 in combination with PD-1 blockade in melanoma and other tumor types. We believe the combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies is scientifically sound and, if approved, will be commercially attractive compared to combinations with other immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab. 
 Mechanism of Action of CMP-001
The human immune system possesses an innate ability to recognize and attack a wide variety of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, as well as an ability to continuously surveil for dead, dying and diseased tissue. Like humans, bacteria and some viruses have DNA that encode their genome. Unlike humans, however, the DNA of viruses and bacteria has a distinct molecular structure with unmethylated CpG DNA which activates dedicated TLR9 receptors in pDCs. CpG DNA are relatively common in bacterial and viral DNA but are suppressed and methylated in human and other vertebrate DNA. 
 Once in an activated state, pDCs secrete large quantities of IFN-α to put the innate and adaptive immune system in a position to fight off infections and foreign bodies, such as tumors. This activation is critical since, in their resting, unactivated state in the microenvironment of many solid tumors, pDCs play an immunoinhibitory role in which they protect tumors from immune attack. We believe that CMP-001 can reverse this unfavorable pDC phenotype present in many tumors by causing these innate immune cells to trigger the bodys adaptive immune system, leading to a tumor-specific, T cell response. 
 CMP-001 is structurally and biologically distinct from other TLR9 agonists in clinical development. It consists of unmethylated CpG-A DNA on a natural phosphodiester backbone and self-aggregates into G-quadruplex structures that are encapsulated in a virus-like particle to make it appear like a virus to pDCs. The graphic below illustrates the hypothetical mechanism of action of CMP-001.
Unactivated pDCs can be recruited into tumors and protect them from immune attack. Injections of CMP-001 cause an antibody response to the VLP, which has been shown in preclinical studies to enhance the uptake of antibody-coated CMP-001 into pDCs through the activating Fc receptor, CD32. These studies also demonstrated that the VLP enhanced the systemic effect of the CpG-A beyond that of unencapsulated CpG-A. The natural phosphodiester backbone allows the CpG DNA to be cleaved inside the early endosome of the pDC, and has been shown to mediate greater activation of pDCs through TLR9. Activated pDCs can release large amounts of Type I interferons, which facilitate recruitment and activation of other immune cells, such as conventional dendritic cells, and T cells. We believe these effects can potentially culminate in the generation of large numbers of tumor-targeted T cells capable of killing the tumor both locally and systemically.

 Our Development Strategy 
 Our clinical development strategy for CMP-001 is focused on two key pillars. First, on the strength of our clinical data to date, we intend to continue advancing clinical development toward a regulatory submission seeking approval of CMP-001 for the treatment of advanced melanoma. Second, because we believe that the mechanism of action for CMP-001 and the potential to enhance the effectiveness of PD-1 blockade are not limited to melanoma, we intend to develop CMP-001 in other relevant tumor types and indications, with an initial focus on head and neck cancer. 
 Clinical Data Supporting Our CMP-001 Development Plan 
 We have based our development plan on clinical data from three data sets: 
 

1. | CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with PD-1 refractory melanoma
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab in patients with PD-1 naïve neoadjuvant melanoma
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Single-agent CMP-001 treatment in patients with PD-1 refractory melanoma
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These data, which are described in further detail below, show that CMP-001 has been generally well-tolerated and has demonstrated preliminary anti-tumor activity in patients in combination with a PD-1 blockade in both PD-1 refractory melanoma and PD-1 naïve, neoadjuvant melanoma settings. While there has not been a head-to-head clinical trial comparing the CMP-001 and anti-PD-1 therapy combination with single agent anti-PD-1 therapy, we believe that the data generated to date supports further clinical evaluation of this combination. 
 Melanoma is a particularly dangerous form of cancer because of its ability to spread to other organs rapidly if not surgically removed at an early stage, as well as low response rates and limited durability of response when treated with commonly used chemotherapeutics. In 2020, melanoma of the skin is estimated to be the fifth most diagnosed cancer, and accounts for approximately 1% of all skin cancers in the United States. Estimates by the American Cancer Society of new diagnoses and deaths as a result of melanoma in the United States are 100,350 and 6,850 respectively. Most cases of melanoma are diagnosed at an early-stage and can often be cured with surgery alone. Patients diagnosed with early-stage melanoma typically have a five-year survival rate of 99%. More advanced melanoma can result in widespread metastasis to organs, including the skin, lung, brain, liver or intestines, and is less responsive to systemic therapy. Until the introduction of CPIs, treatment for metastatic melanoma primarily included surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, interferon, or a combination of these treatments. According to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, the five-year survival rate for metastatic melanoma patients is only approximately 25%. Despite the significant rates of responses achieved with CPIs compared to historical standards of care in patients with metastatic melanoma, a large portion of patients still do not respond to immunotherapy and only about half of all melanomas have genetic mutations that make them suitable for treatment with targeted therapies. Therefore, additional novel therapies are needed to expand the potential of immunotherapy to more patients. 
 Based on key opinion leader discussions, we believe a substantial proportion of patients with melanoma have at least one lesion that is accessible for intratumoral injection. These include cutaneous and sub-cutaneous lesions as well as palpable lymph nodes. To the extent that injection of a single lesion has been shown to have a systemic (abscopal) effect, patients with a single accessible lesion may be candidates for treatment with drugs administered by intratumoral injection. In clinical trials with CMP-001, injections have often been performed in outpatient clinics, by physicians, nurse practitioners, and nursesoften without the need for any imaging to assist in the procedure. These injections have been generally described to be similar to subcutaneous injections with various agents.

 Phase 1b Study of Intratumoral CMP-001 in Patients with anti-PD-1 Refractory Melanoma 
 In October 2015, we initiated a two-part Phase 1b clinical trial to assess the effects of intratumoral CMP-001 in adult patients with advanced melanoma. In this trial, treatment with CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab has been generally well-tolerated, and CMP-001 reversed or overcame resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in some patients with melanoma that progressed on prior anti-PD-1 therapy. We believe these data provide the foundation to pursue further Phase 2 studies with CMP-001 in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody in patients who have metastatic or unresectable melanoma, particularly those with disease progression despite prior treatment with PD-1 blockade. 
 Part 1Combination Treatment with CMP-001 and Pembrolizumab 
 Trial Design and Endpoints 
 In Part 1 of the Phase 1b study, which is fully enrolled, adult patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma who did not respond or had disease progression after at least four doses of treatment that included PD-1 blockade were eligible for enrollment in the trial. The objectives of the study are to determine the recommended dose and schedule of CMP-001 when given in combination with pembrolizumab, or KEYTRUDA, and to assess and describe the safety profile, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of the combination. Clinical benefit is being assessed through measurements of objective tumor response and duration of response every 12 weeks by the site investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Patients with progressive disease were allowed to continue study treatment at the discretion of the investigator. 
 As of September 30, 2020, we enrolled 159 patients and assessed five dose levels, two dose schedules, and two formulations of CMP-001 (polysorbate 20 (PS20) at 0.01% and 0.00167% concentrations) in Part 1 of this study given intratumorally in combination with pembrolizumab, which was administered intravenously every three weeks according to the US Prescribing Information. The median age of the patients was 64 years and 56% were male. The median number of prior therapies was two (with a range of one to eight), and all patients received one or more prior regimens containing PD-1 blockade. Seventy-five percent (119/159) of patients received monotherapy PD-1 blockade and 50% (80/159) received PD-1 blockade in combination with other agents. Forty-seven percent of the patients had prior ipilimumab as a single agent and/or in combination with other drugs. The best response to prior therapy that included PD-1 blockade was progressive disease (PD) in 43% of the patients, stable disease (SD) in 31% of the patients, PR in 13% of patients and a complete response, or CR, in 4% of patients and 8% were unknown. Prior to enrollment, the last response assessment of PD-1 blocking antibody therapy was PD in 93% of patients, SD in 3% and unknown in 4%. Sixty-five percent of patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of zero and 35% had an ECOG performance status of one. Thirty-six percent had melanoma with a BRAF mutation. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) an adverse prognostic factor in patients with melanoma, was elevated in 42% of patients at baseline. The baseline disease locations in patients enrolled to the study included skin only in 8% of patients, lymph nodes (with or without skin lesions) in 19%, soft tissue (with or without skin lesions or lymph node metastases) in 13%, bone (with or without skin, lymph nodes, or soft tissue but without visceral metastases) in 4%, and any visceral metastases in 55%. 
Anti-tumor Activity 
 We believe that we have demonstrated proof of concept for CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab in the PD-1 refractory melanoma patient setting based on the results from this trial. In the 98 patients who initiated treatment with intratumoral CMP-001 in 0.01% PS20, which was selected for subsequent development based on the results of this study, we observed that 28% (27/98) of these patients had a partial or complete response, including patients who responded to continued treatment after initial disease progression. The group of 98 also had a best ORR by RECIST v1.1 of 23% (23/98). The best ORR by RECIST v1.1 in the 61 patients who initiated treatment with intratumoral CMP-001 0.00167% PS20 was 11% (7/61). A publication in 2020 from the KEYNOTE-002 study reported that six patients out of 78 (7.7%) achieved an objective response with continued pembrolizumab treatment after initial disease progression. Based on this report, we believe that a response rate above 7% would be indicative of a treatment effect in excess of anti-PD-1 treatment alone. 
 
11 


 In all the 159 patients who were treated by CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab, the Kaplan-Meier analysis produced a median duration of response of 19.9 months for all 37 responders including post-progression responders, and 19.9 months for the 30 responders with a RECIST v1.1 response as of the cutoff date. 
 We believe that the response rate and durability of response observed with CMP-001 treatment in combination with pembrolizumab in these patients provides strong evidence that CMP-001 administered intratumorally in combination with PD-1 blockade has the potential to address the unmet medical need for patients with melanoma that is progressing despite administering a PD-1 blockade. The activity of CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab was observed in both injected and non-injected target lesions, as shown in the figure below. The magnitude of regression between the injected and non-injected lesions was similar. In these responding patients, the mean regression across all injected target lesions was 71% and the mean regression across all non-injected target lesions was 62%. 
 CMP-001 + Pembrolizumab in Anti-PD-1 Refractory Melanoma: Regression in Injected and Noninjected Lesions 
 


Safety Results 
 As of September 30, 2020, of the 159 patients enrolled in Part 1 of the Phase 1b clinical trial, all but three have experienced at least one adverse event assessed as treatment-related by the investigator. The most common adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 and include flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions. Treatment-related adverse events reported in at least 20% of patients included: chills (119 patients, 75%); pyrexia (98 patients, 62%); fatigue (87 patients, 55%); nausea (77 patients, 48%); vomiting (51 patients, 32%); injection site pain (48 patients, 30%); headache (48 patients, 30%); diarrhea (35 patients, 22%); decreased appetite (34 patients, 21%); back pain (33 patients, 21%), and hypotension (32 patients, 20%). Sixteen patients (10%) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation which were considered related to treatment included pneumonitis (n=2) and atrial fibrillation, chills, diarrhea, disseminated intravascular dissemination, dyspnea, generalized edema, injection related reaction, injection site pain, muscular weakness, pancreatitis (n=1 each). Twenty-seven patients (17%) experienced a treatment-related serious adverse event (SAE) which included hypotension (n=7, 4%); pyrexia, cytokine release syndrome, muscular weakness (n=2, 1.3%); adrenal insufficiency, arthritis, asthenia, increased AST, atrial fibrillation, basal ganglia infarction, bronchitis, cardiac failure congestive, chills, confusional state, deep vein thrombosis, diarrhea, disseminated intravascular coagulation, encephalopathy, eye inflammation, fatigue, generalized edema, intracranial hemorrhage, nausea, peripheral edema, peripheral ischemia, pneumonitis, tumor pain, vomiting (n=1 patient, 0.6%). Fifty-eight patients (36%) experienced one or more treatment-related adverse events of Grade 3 or higher. The most common Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related 
 
12 


  adverse events reported in at least three patients included hypotension (n=11, 7%), hypertension (n=8, 5%), chills, back pain (n=5 each, 3%), increased AST, hypoxia, pyrexia (n=4 each, 2.5%), anemia, increased ALT, arthralgia, and hypophosphatemia (n=3 each, 2%). 
 Part 2Monotherapy Treatment with CMP-001
Trial Design and Endpoints 
 In Part 2 of the Phase 1b clinical trial, which has been fully enrolled, adult patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma who did not respond or had disease progression after at least four doses of PD-1 blockade were eligible for treatment. The objectives of Part 2 are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of monotherapy CMP-001. Patients with progressive disease on CMP-001 monotherapy had the option to receive CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab. 
 Interim Anti-tumor Activity 
 In an interim analysis of the ongoing trial as of the data cut-off date of September 30, 2020, 40 patients were treated with intratumoral CMP-001 at initial doses of 5 mg or 10 mg. The median age of the patients was 68 years and 65% were male. The median number of prior lines of treatment was two (with a range of one to seven). Lactate dehydrogenase was elevated in 45% of the patients and 30% had a BRAF mutation. The ECOG PS was 0 in 50% and 1 in 50% of the patients. The last response on therapy containing a PD-1 blocking antibody was progressive disease in 80% (32 patients), stable disease in 10% (4 patients), partial response in 5% (2 patients), and unknown in 5% (2 patients). The best response on therapy containing a PD-1 blocking antibody was progressive disease in 23% (9 patients), stable disease in 45% (18 patients), partial response in 13% (5 patients), complete response in 5% (2 patients), and unknown in 15% (6 patients). Forty-three percent of the patients (17 patients) received prior treatment with ipilimumab as a single agent and/or in combination with other agents. As of the cutoff date, seven patients achieved a partial response for a best ORR of 18%. 
 Patients enrolled in Part 2 are allowed to have pembrolizumab added to their CMP-001 continuing regimen at the time of disease progression. While we believe the early activity observed in patients treated with of CMP-001 is encouraging, the duration of response with CMP-001 monotherapy has been less than observed in combination with PD-1 blockade. We therefore plan to focus subsequent development of CMP-001 in combinations that include PD-1 blockade. 
 Safety Results 
 As of September 30, 2020, forty patients enrolled and 38 (95%) had at least one treatment-related adverse event. The most common treatment-related adverse events (reported in at least 20% of patients) to single-agent CMP-001 included chills (21 patients, 53%); nausea (19 patients, 48%); pyrexia (18 patients, 45%); fatigue (15 patients, 38%), headache (14 patients, 35%), hypotension (10 patients, 25%); back pain, decreased appetite, vomiting (9 patients, 23%), and pruritus(8 patients, 20%). 
 Nine patients (23%) experienced one or more treatment-related Grade 3 adverse events, which included hypotension, infusion related reaction (2 patients, 5%), and increased ALT, increased AST, bone pain, bradycardia, flank pain, headache, hypertension, pyrexia, rash, spinal pain, and syncope (1 patient, 3%). There were no Grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events reported at the time of data cut-off.
Six patients (15%) experienced one or more treatment-related SAEs. SAEs considered related to study treatments included hypotension (3 patients, 8%) and bradycardia, chills, cytokine release syndrome, dizziness, headache, nausea, pemphigoid, presyncope, rash, and syncope (1 patient, 3%). Three patients discontinued study treatment due to adverse events considered related to study treatment including one subject who had bradycardia, hypotension, and presyncope, one subject who had an injection site reaction, and one subject who had headache, nausea, chills and rigors.

 Trial Design and Treatment Extension 
 The safety of CMP-001 when administered in combination with pembrolizumab or as monotherapy will continue to be evaluated in the Treatment Extension. Enrollment into the Treatment Extension is available to patients receiving treatment in Part 1 or Part 2 at the discretion of the investigator. Patients will continue their current treatment regimen with reduced study assessments focused on the collection of safety data. 
 Investigator-sponsored Clinical Trial of CMP-001 in Combination with Nivolumab in PD-1 Naïve Neoadjuvant Melanoma Patient Setting 
 We are currently supporting an investigator-sponsored clinical trial in PD-1 naïve neoadjuvant melanoma. In August 2018, investigators at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center began a trial to evaluate CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with resectable melanoma not previously treated with PD-1 blockade. Data from this trial, as described below, have shown that CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab has been generally well-tolerated and has not delayed or complicated surgery. We believe the high pathological response rate, including pCR and MPR rates, observed in this investigator-sponsored trial, combined with the generally manageable adverse events we have observed in our clinical trials of CMP-001, provide supporting evidence for the potential of CMP-001 in combination with PD-1 blockade in patients with melanoma naïve to PD-1 blockade in both the neoadjuvant and first-line settings. 
 Trial Design and Endpoints 
 Eligible patients had resectable Stage IIIB, IIIC, or IIID melanoma and had never received treatment that included PD-1 blockade. The trial enrolled 31 patients of which all patients were evaluable for safety and 30 patients were evaluable for the primary endpoint. The trial design consisted of weekly doses of CMP-001 for seven consecutive weeks in combination with three doses of nivolumab at two-week intervals. Patients undergo surgical resection and recovery between weeks eight and 10, after which they will receive adjuvant nivolumab in combination with CMP-001 administered local regionally and draining of lymph nodes for up to 54 weeks. 
 The primary endpoint of this trial was to evaluate MPR in patients with stage IIIB/C melanoma following 7 weeks of nivolumab and injected CMP-001. The secondary objectives were to evaluate safety, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) after 52 weeks of nivolumab/CMP-001 combination. Final data on the primary endpoint from this ongoing trial were presented on November 11, 2020 at the 35th Annual Meeting of The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer and are described below. 
 Final Anti-Tumor Activity 
 As of the cut-off date of October 1, 2020, 31 patients were enrolled in the trial, and 30 completed neoadjuvant treatment and surgery and were evaluable for the primary endpoint. One patient experienced systemic progression prior to surgery and was evaluable for safety but not for pathological response. Patients had a median age of 61 years (with a range from ages 19-93), and 16 male and 14 female patients were included in the efficacy analysis for pathological response. 
 The Pathologic Response rate was 70%, including pCR of 50% (15/30), pMR of 10% (3/30), and pPR of 10% (3/30). The MPR (pCR and pMR) rate was 60%, and 9 patients (30%) did not have a pathological response (pNR). The landmark 1-year RFS was 90% in patients with a pathological response and 89% in patients with a MPR. 
 Biopsies from patients with a pathological response to CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab showed increased density of intratumoral cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+) and T cells and immunophenotyping studies revealed an increased fraction of circulating CD8+Ki67+ T cells in the blood, suggesting that treatment with CMP-001 and nivolumab was able to activate CD8+ T cells and facilitate T cell infiltration of the tumor

  microenvironment. Additional studies demonstrated a rim of CD303+ pDCs surrounding non-viable tumor in biopsies from some patients. We believe this is important, as tumors that exclude T cells are less likely to respond to immunotherapy with PD-1 blockade, and the potential involvement of pDCs supports our proposed mechanism of action for CMP-001.
Interim Safety Results 
 The treatment with CMP-001 and nivolumab was observed to be generally well-tolerated and most treatment related adverse events were Grade 1 or 2, including flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions. The incidence of immune-related adverse events was low, and one patient had Grade 3 colitis. No dose limiting toxicities were observed, and the most frequent Grade 3 toxicity was hypertension, which was reversible in all cases. No Grade 4 or 5 treatment related adverse events were observed. One patient with a Grade 4 skin infection (not related to CMP-001 and nivolumab) had a delay in surgery although disease remained resectable. There were no delays in planned surgery due to treatment related adverse events. 
 Third-Party Neoadjuvant Clinical Trial Data 
 In a randomized, non-comparative trial of four doses of nivolumab at two-week intervals in 12 patients and nivolumab plus ipilimumab at three week intervals in 11 patients conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center, nivolumab yielded a pCR rate of 25% and ORR of 25% as measured by RECIST v.1.1, while nivolumab plus ipilimumab resulted in a pCR rate of 45% and ORR of 73%. This trial was stopped early due to the inferior outcomes with nivolumab monotherapy and the high rate of Grade 3 or higher adverse events (75%) with the combination. In the OpACIN-neo trial conducted by the Netherlands Cancer Institute, 86 patients were randomized and treated in one of three cohorts of nivolumab and combined with ipilimumab at varying doses and schedules. The objective response rate ranged from 35% to 63%, and the pCR rate ranged from 23% to 57% across the cohorts. The rate of Grade 3 or higher adverse events ranged from 20 to 50%, and one of the three cohorts was closed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for toxicity. The PRADO Trial, which was an extension of the OpACIN-neo trial, reported a pCR rate of 50% and an MPR rate of 61% from 99 patients treated with two doses of neoadjuvant ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) and nivolumab (3 mg/kg) at a 3-week interval prior to surgery. Twenty-two percent of the patients experienced a treatment-related Grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse event. 
 Phase 1b Trial of Subcutaneous CMP-001 In Patients with Advanced Melanoma 
 Trial Design and Endpoints 
 In January 2017, we initiated a two-part clinical trial of CMP-001 administered subcutaneously in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma to evaluate whether subcutaneous CMP-001 is a viable route of treatment in combination with PD-1 blockade. This trial was undertaken to evaluate whether subcutaneous injection near the tumor or in the tumor-draining lymph node bed is able to generate a T cell-specific anti-tumor immune response. To be eligible for this trial, patients are required to have metastatic or unresectable melanoma and have continued disease progression despite at least four doses of treatment that included PD-1 blockade. The objectives of the trial are to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of CMP-001 when administered subcutaneously in combination with pembrolizumab, and to assess and describe the safety profile, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of the combination. CMP-001 was to be injected into an area corresponding to the lymphatic drainage for one or more melanoma lesions. Clinical benefit was assessed through measurements of objective tumor response and duration of response every 12 weeks by the site investigators according to RECIST v1.1. Patients with progressive disease are allowed to continue study treatment at the discretion of the investigator. 
 
15 


 Trial Status 
 As of a cutoff date of June 1, 2020, in the Part 1 dose-escalation phase of the trial, 27 patients were administered CMP-001 subcutaneously at doses ranging from 5 mg to 17.5 mg. The highest planned CMP-001 dose was 20 mg. No patients have been enrolled to Part 2 of the trial. Given our plan to initiate registration studies with CMP-001 in advanced melanoma, we decided to discontinue enrollment to this trial. 
 Interim Anti-tumor Activity 
 As of the cutoff date, 25 patients were evaluable for efficacy assessments, and the best ORR was 8% (2 of 25 evaluable patients by RECIST v.1.1 criteria) and included best responses of one CR and one PR, both in the 10 mg dose group (n=8). There were eight (32%) patients with a RECIST v1.1 best response of stable disease, eleven (42%) patients with a RECIST v1.1 best response of progressive disease, and four (16%) patients who discontinued prior to having a post baseline tumor assessment. 
Interim Safety Results 
 As of the cutoff date, in the Part 1 dose-escalation phase of the trial, 27 patients received CMP-001 SC. All but four patients had at least one adverse event assessed as treatment-related by the Investigator. Most were Grade 1 or 2 adverse events, and included flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions. Four patients (15%) had one or more treatment-related adverse events of Grade 3 or higher which included increased LDH, erythema multiforme, fatigue, pain and tumor pain (1 patient, 4%). One patient (4%) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event of pain due to disease progression that was unrelated to study treatment. Two patients (8%) had a treatment-related serious adverse event. One patient had Grade 3 tumor pain in the abdomen and one had Grade 3 erythema multiforme. Adverse events considered related to study treatment occurring in at least 20% of patients included fatigue (14 patients, 52%); chills (6 patients, 22%), and nausea (6 patients, 22%). 
Clinical Development Plans 
 Our clinical development strategy is to pursue registration of CMP-001 in combination with a PD-1 blocking antibody for the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma, and to establish Proof of Concept in other advanced cancers, beginning with HNSCC. To this end, we are conducting three new clinical studies: 

(1) | a single-arm Phase 2 trial of CMP-001 and nivolumab in patients with anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma,
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | a randomized Phase 2/3 trial of CMP-001 and nivolumab vs. nivolumab in patients with first-line melanoma, and
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | a single-arm Phase 2 trial of CMP-001 and pembrolizumab in patients with HNSCC.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to our studies in melanoma and HNSCC, we intend to conduct additional studies to evaluate CMP-001 in combination with PD-1 blockade in other cancers. 
 Subject to the impact of COVID-19 and the timely initiation and enrollment of these trials, we anticipate reporting ORR data for our Phase 2 trials in first-line melanoma and HNSCC in the second half of 2022, and we expect to complete our planned Phase 2 trial in anti PD-1 refractory melanoma in 2023. If data from the Phase 2 melanoma trials are positive, we may potentially submit a BLA in the second half of 2023. 
 I. Development Plan for CMP-001 For the Treatment of Melanoma 
 The first priority in our development strategy is to progress toward registration for the treatment of both first-line and PD-1 refractory melanoma. We believe that the interim data described above provide supportive evidence of CMP-001s activity in combination with PD-1 blockade, and we intend to initiate clinical trials to advance toward applications for marketing authorization for CMP-001 for the treatment of anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma and first-line melanoma.

 Collaboration with BMS 
 On December 7, 2020, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS), pursuant to which BMS agreed to provide nivolumab for our Phase 2 refractory melanoma study and Phase 2 first-line melanoma study, at its own expense. 
 Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Anti-PD-1 Refractory Melanoma 
 We are conducting Trial CMP-001-010, a multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 trial of intratumoral CMP-001 in combination with intravenous nivolumab in patients with anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma. We plan to conduct this trial at clinical sites in the United States. The primary outcome measure is to determine the confirmed objective response (ORR) based on RECIST v1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). The secondary outcome measures include safety and tolerability, duration of response (DOR), treatment response in non-injected target lesions, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), immune objective response rate (iORR), immune duration of response (iDOR), immune progression-free survival (iPFS), pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity. Trial sites have been activated and patient screening is underway. Approximately 100 patients are planned to be enrolled. 
Randomized Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial in First-line Melanoma 
 We are conducting Trial CMP-001-011, a multi-center, Phase 2/3 randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial of intratumoral CMP-001 in combination with intravenous nivolumab versus nivolumab alone in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic melanoma. The primary outcome measure for Phase 2 is to determine the confirmed ORR of CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy based on RECIST v1.1 as determined by BICR. The secondary outcome measures for Phase 2 include safety and tolerability. A total of 140 patients will be enrolled in Phase 2, and if the primary endpoint of Phase 2 is met, the trial may proceed into Phase 3 with a total trial sample size of approximately 450 patients. The primary outcome measure for Phase 3 is to evaluate the PFS of CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy based on RECIST v1.1 as determined by BICR. The secondary outcome measures for 3 include safety and tolerability, OS; confirmed ORR, DOR, and disease control rate (DCR) based on RECIST v1.1 as determined by BICR; treatment response in non-injected target lesions, iPFS, iDOR, and iORR. In March 2021, we initiated patient dosing in the trial. 
 We believe that these two trials will inform and enable a registration strategy in PD-1 naïve first-line melanoma, PD-1 refractory melanoma, or both, including a potential Phase 3 registrational trial in first-line melanoma. 
 Regulatory Status of Melanoma Development Program 
 In February 2020, we received Orphan Drug Designation for a TRL9 agonist (CMP-001) for the treatment of Stages IIb-IV melanoma. 
 In March 2020, we met with the FDA to discuss the potential for pursuing accelerated approval of CMP-001 based upon the single-arm trial in anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma described above, and to pursue full approval in CPI-naïve first-line melanoma based upon a randomized trial comparing CMP-001 in combination with PD-1 blockade vs. PD-1 blockade alone. With respect to our plans to seek accelerated approval in anti-PD-1 refractory melanoma, the FDA indicated that we would likely be required to provide ORR data from a randomized trial to assess the contribution of individual components to the effect of the combination. In July 2020, we received Fast Track designation for CMP-001 for unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma and unresectable or metastatic melanoma refractory to prior anti-PD-1 blockade. We plan to generate ORR data from the planned randomized first-line melanoma trial described above, but there is no guarantee that such ORR data will support a BLA seeking accelerated approval of CMP-001 in anti-PD1 refractory melanoma. 
 
17 


 We intend to seek data exclusivity or market exclusivity for our product candidates provided under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and similar laws in other countries. We believe that CMP-001 could qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity, from the date of approval, under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Under the BPCIA, a BLA cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or if approved by the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product is approved under a BLA. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. 
 II. Develop CMP-001 For Use Across Other Tumor Types and Indications 
 We believe CMP-001 has the potential to be developed for any cancer type where PD-1 blockade has shown some degree of efficacy, but where significant unmet medical need remains. We are conducting a clinical trial in HNSCC in patients who have not yet received treatment with PD-1 blockade. We are also collaborating with an affiliate of Merck KGaA (Merck) and Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer), and supporting a small number of investigator-sponsored studies in melanoma and other cancers. 
 HNSCC represents a number of different malignant tumors that develop in or around the throat, larynx, nose, sinuses and mouth, and accounts for approximately 3.6% of all cancers in the United States. Most head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. According to the American Cancer Society, there will be an estimated 53,260 new diagnoses and approximately 10,750 patients will die as a result of head and neck cancer in the United States in 2020. HNSCC is more than twice as prevalent among men, and most cases are believed to be related to tobacco or alcohol use. The human papilloma virus is an important and common cause of head and neck cancer, particularly in younger patients. According to the American Cancer Society, the five-year survival rate for HNSCC is approximately 65%. Treatments for HNSCC include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of treatments. HNSCC tumors are an attractive setting for immunotherapy clinical research as they have a high tumor mutation burden leading to the expression of a number of tumor-specific antigens that could lead to recognition by the adaptive immune system and killing of the tumor by tumor-specific T cells. While nivolumab was approved for treatment of patients with recurrent and metastatic HNSCC with ORR of 13.3% and pembrolizumab was approved for first-line treatment of HNSCC with ORR of 19%, based on the ORR for these agents, we believe there is a significant unmet clinical need for new treatment options. 
 CMP-001 and Pembrolizumab in PD-1 Naïve HNSCC 
 We are conducting a Phase 2 trial of CMP-001 and pembrolizumab in approximately 43 patients with HNSCC that have not been previously treated with PD-1 blockade. Eligible patients for this trial are expected to have recurrent or metastatic cancers of the oropharynx, oral cavity, hypopharynx, or larynx that are incurable with available therapies. Treatment is expected to include intratumoral injections of CMP-001 combined with pembrolizumab at its approved dose and schedule. The primary outcome measure is to determine the confirmed, investigator-assessed ORR based on RECIST v1.1. The secondary outcome measures include safety and tolerability; efficacy characterized by DOR, PFS, OS, iORR, iDOR, and iPFS; and the effect of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on efficacy. Trial sites have been activated and patient screening is underway. 
 CMP-001 and Avelumab in PD-1 Refractory HNSCC 
 Collaboration with Merck KGaA and Pfizer 
 In September 2018, we entered into a clinical collaboration with Merck and Pfizer in the Pfizer-sponsored JAVELIN Medley Trial. Combination F in the JAVELIN Medley Trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of three cohorts: (1) avelumab in combination with CMP-001; (2) avelumab in combination with CMP-001 and utomilumab, and (3) avelumab in combination with CMP-001 and PF-04518600 in patients with advanced 
 
18 


  SCCHN resistant to prior PD-1 blocking antibody. Each combination will be studied individually in 2 trial parts: (1) a Phase 1b lead-in part to evaluate safety, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose and recommended Phase 2 dose (if applicable), of the combination, and 2) a Phase 2 part to evaluate efficacy and further evaluate safety of the selected dose from the Phase 1b portion. Up to 60 patients are expected to be enrolled in the trial. The first patient was dosed in this ongoing trial in October 2019. To date, no data have been publicly disclosed by Pfizer. 
 Interim Safety from Checkmate-Sponsored Trials and Clinical Collaboration 
 As of November 15, 2020, the identified risks associated with CMP-001 administration in three Checkmate-sponsored trials and one clinical collaboration are hypotension and a variety of flu-like symptoms which can include but may not be limited to nausea, vomiting, chills, and/or rigors. Headache, tachycardia, rash, or hypoxia may also occur. The potential risks for CMP-001 when combined with a PD-1 blocking antibody include allergic reactions, immune-mediated AEs, including, but not limited to, dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine and other less common inflammatory events. 
 Investigator-Sponsored Clinical Trials in Cancers with High Unmet Medical Need 
 In addition to the clinical trial in patients with PD-1 naive neoadjuvant melanoma described above, we are currently supporting four other investigator-sponsored studies, each under their own investigator IND, where CMP-001 is administered in combination with other cancer immunotherapy treatments, with or without radiation therapy, in patients with metastatic mismatch repair proficient colorectal cancer, lymphoma, triple negative breast cancer, and pancreas cancer. Of these, the trials in metastatic colorectal cancer and lymphoma, described below, have initiated enrollment. 
Combined Immunotherapy and Radiosurgery for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer 
 In December 2018, investigators from Sheba Medical Center in Israel initiated a single institution trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab, ipilimumab, and radiosurgery in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and liver metastases. To be eligible to participate, patients must have colorectal cancer with at least two metastases to the liver and have previously received two or more standard therapies. Patients with a phenotype with high microsatellite instability or a known mismatch repair deficiency are excluded from the trial. The objectives of the trial are safety, response in the non-injected, non-irradiated lesions and PFS. To date, no data have been publicly disclosed by Sheba Medical Center. 
 CMP-001 for Relapsed and Refractory Lymphoma 
 In January 2020, investigators from the University of Iowa initiated a single institution trial to evaluate CMP-001 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma or Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The objectives of the trial are to determine the dose limiting toxicities and objective response rate of treatment with intratumoral CMP-001 combined with intravenous pembrolizumab. To date, no data have been publicly disclosed by the University of Iowa. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and the immuno-oncology subsector, are characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that our CMP-001 program and our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face competition from many sources including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with a range of currently approved cancer therapies and any new therapies that may become available in the future. Our competitors include 
 
19 


  larger and better funded biopharmaceutical, biotechnology and therapeutics companies, specifically companies focused on cancer immunotherapies, such as Amgen, Inc., AstraZeneca plc, BMS, Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding Ltd and Sanofi S.A. Paradoxically, many of these companies are developing systemic immunotherapeutics which have the potential to be developed in combination with CMP-001 and so we view them both from a competitive and complementary perspective. 
 Oncology drugs and therapeutics on the market range from traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, to antibody-drug conjugates, such as Genentech Inc.s KADCYLA, to immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting CTLA-4, such as BMS YERVOY, and PD-1/PD-L1, such as BMS OPDIVO, Merck & Co.s KEYTRUDA and Genentechs TECENTRIQ, to T cell-engager immunotherapies, such as Amgens BLINCYTO and to oncolytic immunotherapies, including Amgens T-Vec, an FDA-approved oncolytic immunotherapy for treating advanced melanoma. 
 Additionally, we view as our most direct potential competitors companies such as TriSalus Life Sciences, Exicure, Inc., and Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which are conducting clinical trials utilizing TLR9 agonists in cancer immunotherapy that may have utility for similar indications that we are targeting. We believe that CMP-001 is unique and differentiated from other agents targeting TLR9. Moreover, we may also compete with smaller or earlier-stage companies, universities and other research institutions that have developed, are developing or may be developing current and future cancer therapeutics. 
 Our success will be based in part upon our ability to successfully commercialize CMP-001 and to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of therapeutics that are safer and more effective than competing products in our target indications. Our market opportunity has the potential to be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any therapeutics we may develop. Our competitive position will also be dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, and protect our intellectual property, and to secure sufficient capital resources for the period between technological conception and commercial sales. The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We believe our rights under issued patents and if allowed, our patent applications, will provide a competitive advantage. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 For the core technology related to CMP-001 and its component parts, we are prosecuting seven families of patent applications which we own, including composition of matter, methods of use, combination therapies, drug delivery, dose volume, aggregation, packaging and pDC recruitment claims. Further, we have an exclusive license for 10 families of patents and patent applications including composition of matter, manufacturing methods, aggregation, packaging and synthesis claims. Some of our patents have issued in the United States and internationally and others are pending in the United States and internationally (either in foreign jurisdictions or under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)). As of June 30, 2020, we own or exclusively license the rights to 14 issued US granted patents and 
 
20 


  20 pending patent applications worldwide for almost every human and veterinary therapy. We or our licensors have filed patent applications in 33 foreign jurisdictions including the EU, Canada, Japan, China, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, India, France and Germany. The patents include claims directed to combination therapy of TLR9 agonists and checkpoint inhibitors, Fc receptor-mediated drug delivery, volumes and methods for administration, pDC recruitment, aggregation and packaging and methods of treatment claims. We estimate, without taking potential patent term extensions into account, that these issued patents will expire between 2036 and 2038. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal patent term in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for a patent term extension, which permits restoration of a portion of the patent term elapsed during the U.S. clinical development and FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under clinical development in the United States and the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, and if and when patents are granted, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions for each of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors, as well as physical security of our premises and our information technology systems. 
 We intend to seek data exclusivity or market exclusivity for our product candidates provided under the FDCA and similar laws in other countries. We believe that CMP-001 could qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity, from the date of approval, under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Under the BPCIA, a BLA cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or if approved by the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product is approved under a BLA. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. 
 License Agreement with Kuros 
 In June 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Cytos Biotechnology LTD (now Kuros Biosciences AG (Kuros)) as amended in August 2017 and as further amended in January 2018 (the Kuros License Agreement). Pursuant to the Kuros License Agreement, we were granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license, under all of Kuros intellectual property rights, including any intellectual property rights arising during the term of the agreement, to commercially develop, manufacture, use, distribute, and sell certain therapeutic products, including CMP-001, or the Licensed Products, for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of all indications in humans and animals. Under the terms of the Kuros License Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one Licensed Product. 
 Under the Kuros License Agreement, we have paid Kuros licensing fees totaling $1.25 million, including $1.0 million paid upon execution of the agreement in 2015 and $250 thousand paid upon execution of the second amendment in 2018. We also agreed to make payments to Kuros for each product that achieves certain development and regulatory milestones, including payments of up to $56 million for the current oncology programs. To date, we have paid a $1.0 million milestone payment in connection with the dosing of the first patient in our first Phase 1 clinical trial in 2016. Additional milestones of $2 million and $4 million are payable upon the respective dosings of first patient in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. The $2 million milestone was 
 
21 


  triggered in March 2021 with our initiation of patient dosing in the front-line melanoma trial and the $4 million milestone is anticipated to be achieved in the first half of 2021. We are also required to pay tiered royalties of high single-digit to low teens percentages on annual net sales of Licensed Products that are covered by a licensed patent, as well as royalties at 50% of the foregoing amounts with respect to sales of Licensed Products that are not covered by a licensed patent, but are covered by licensed know-how. The royalty obligation will terminate on a country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim, including composition of matter, manufacturing methods, aggregation, packaging or synthesis claims, within the licensed patent rights, each of which will expire between 2022 and 2027 with potential patent term extensions ranging from two months to five years, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity in such country, and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. 
 The Kuros License Agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the Licensed Products in the territory. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement in full for an uncured material breach of the agreement upon written 60 days notice to the other party. We have the right to terminate the agreement for any reason upon 90 days written notice to Kuros. 
 Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreements 
 On December 7, 2020, we entered into the Master Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement (MCTCA) with BMS. The MCTCA dictates the general terms that govern specific collaborative studies between the companies, including our Phase 2 refractory melanoma study and Phase 2 first-line melanoma study (collectively, the collaborative studies). Pursuant to the MCTCA, BMS agreed to provide nivolumab, a drug to be used in combination with CMP-001, in the collaborative studies, at its own expense. As part of the MCTCA, the parties granted each other non-exclusive licenses to use background intellectual property and regulatory documentation to seek regulatory approval of the other partys compound solely for use as a combination therapy. We do not expect to incur any future costs in connection with the MCTCA. 
 On July 2018, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Ares Trading, S.A., an affiliate of Merck, and Pfizer (together with Merck, the Alliance), as amended in March 2019, under which we are conducting a clinical trial evaluating CMP-001 in combination with MSB0010718C (avelumab) and with Pfizers PF-04518600 (utomilumab), together with avelumab and CMP-001, the compounds, in patients with advanced cancers. This is part of a larger trial known as the JAVELIN Medley trial. Pfizer is acting as sponsor of the clinical trial and each party will supply their applicable compound for use in the clinical trial at no charge. The trial costs are shared by the parties and Checkmates reasonability for the trial costs is approximately 40%. 
Manufacturing & Supply 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of CMP-001 and any future product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We source our manufacturing and supply requirements with a number of contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) through the issuance of work orders on an as-needed basis. We currently do not have any long-term supply contracts. We depend and will continue to depend on our CMOs to manufacture our drug candidates in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations for use in clinical trials. 
 We manage multiple CMOs to develop and manufacture CMP-001 drug product. CMP-001 is a VLP comprised of a Qb (Qbeta) coat protein that is assembled around an immunostimulatory CpG-A oligodeoxynucleotide, G10. Qb is recombinantly produced by fermentation in E. coli, and then purified free of other cellular material at one of our CMOs. The G10 oligonucleotide is produced via solid support phosphoramidite chemistry at one of two additional CMOs. The two drug substance intermediates, Qb and G10, are combined in an aqueous salt buffer where they self-assemble into virus-like particles prior to final purification of the drug substance at another CMO. Another CMO performs the fill and finish of the final drug product.

 Sales and Marketing 
 In light of our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We have retained worldwide commercial rights for our product candidates. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the United States with our own focused, specialty sales force. We also plan to evaluate options for delivering CMP-001, if approved, to patients in other key markets such as Europe, Japan, and China, which may include strategic collaborations. 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our vendors, collaboration third-parties, CROs and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidate. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 In the United States, where we are initially focusing our product development, the FDA regulates biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and their implementing regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our product candidate is early-stage and has not been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States. 
 The process required by the FDA before our product candidate is approved for therapeutic indications and may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biological product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA, to file the application for review;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product will be produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (cGMPs) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological products continued safety, purity and potency;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical and Clinical Trials for Biologics 
 Before testing any drug or biologic in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety and toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development of a product candidate, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin. 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trials results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 While we may conduct international clinical trials under INDs in the future, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. 
 
24 


 Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap. 
 

 | Phase 1Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human participants exposed to the biologic and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsors initial receipt of the information. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life and to identify appropriate storage conditions for the product candidate. 
 BLA Submission and Review by the FDA 
 We intend to seek data exclusivity or market exclusivity for CMP-001. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the products chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. A BLA is a request for approval to market a new biologic for one or more specified indications. The BLA must 
 
25 


  include all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the products chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a products use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a biological product that includes a new clinically active component, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the products continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA filed for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions may be available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a biologic to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) as a condition for approving the BLA to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools. 
 
26 


 After evaluating the BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter will usually describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDAs satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a products safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs for Biologics 
 The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and Accelerated Approval. 
 A new biologic is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
 In addition, a new drug or biological product may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biologic, alone or in combination with or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate. 
 
27 


 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including priority review and Accelerated Approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDAs goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review). 
 A product intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive Accelerated Approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 Accelerated Approval is usually contingent on a sponsors agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the products clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or biologic approved under Accelerated Approval if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct the confirmatory trials in a timely manner or the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for Accelerated Approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication. 
 Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process. 
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation (ODD) to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater of than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States of that drug or biologic. ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. 
 If a product that has received ODD and subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular clinically active component for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years from the approval of the BLA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. 
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received ODD. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may 
 
28 


  be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 U.S. Post-approval Requirements for Biologics 
 Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as off-label use) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe approved products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including not only by Company employees but also by agents of the Company or those speaking on the Companys behalf, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including liabilities under the False Claims Act where products carry reimbursement under federal health care programs. Promotional materials for approved biologics must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of a BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug and biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual program fee for any marketed product. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
29 


 
 | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | holds on clinical trials;
--+--------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicants own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed interchangeable by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued Written Request for such a trial. 
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and regulatory interpretation of the BPCIA remain subject to significant uncertainty.

 Other Regulatory Matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies. 
Other Healthcare Laws 
 Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below. 

 | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act (FCA), which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a whistleblower to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs;

HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;

 | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA), imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid (the Childrens Health Insurance Program) for certain payments and transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, many states also require reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made in the previous year to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners;

These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts.

 The distribution of biological products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. For example, On November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, finalized further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Under the final rules, OIG 
 
32 


  added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. Pursuant to an order entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D has been delayed to January 1, 2023. Implementation of the this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and pharmacy benefit manager service fees are currently under review by the Biden administration and may be amended or repealed. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a companys attention from its business. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors, but the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is: 
 

 | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------

 
33 


 
 | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


 | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

 Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payors decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payors determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a companys revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. The Affordable Care Act includes provisions of importance to our potential product candidate that: 

 | created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanded manufacturers rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of average manufacturer price, or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide point-of-sale-discounts off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | created a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.

 Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the United States Supreme Court; the former Trump Administration issued various Executive Orders eliminating cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices; and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. The United States Supreme Court is expected to rule on a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA in early 2021. The implementation of the ACA is ongoing, the law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Litigation and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, designed to provide financial support and resources to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as subsequent legislation, suspended these reductions from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, and extended the sequester by one year, through 2030. Proposed legislation, if passed, would extend this suspension until the end of the pandemic. In addition, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, at the federal level, the Trump administrations budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the Trump administration sent principles for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Further, the Trump administration also previously released a Blueprint to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already implemented certain measures. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will challenge, reverse, revoke or otherwise modify these executive and administrative actions after January 20, 2021. In addition, individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 
35 


 On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer under the Cures Act must make publicly available its policy for expanded access requests. We review each individual request for access through the Cures Act, the Right to Try Act and similar state laws, and may or may not provide access depending upon the facts of each request. Checkmate has adopted an Expanded Access Policy which is available on our website. 
 Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. 
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or they may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries. 
 Compliance with Other Federal and State Laws or Requirements; Changing Legal Requirements 
 If any products that we may develop are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to we may be subject. 
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 
36 


 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our managements attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 Other U.S. Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations 
 We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. 
 We maintain workers compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us. 
 In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. 
 Government Regulation of Drugs Outside of the United States 
 To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization or identification of an alternate regulatory pathway, manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products. For instance, in the European Economic Area (the EEA) (comprised of the 27 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, medicinal products must be authorized for marketing by using either the centralized authorization procedure or a national authorization procedures. 

 | Centralized procedureIf pursuing marketing authorization of a product candidate for a therapeutic indication under the centralized procedure, following the opining of the EMAs Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, (CHMP), the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid throughout the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from biotechnology processes or advanced therapy medicinal products (gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
37 


 
tissue engineered products), products that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMAs recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | National authorization proceduresThere are also two other possible routes to authorize products for therapeutic indications in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Decentralized procedureUsing the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EEA country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EEA country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Mutual recognition procedureIn the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EEA Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, additional marketing authorizations can be sought from other EEA countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 
 Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required. 
 In the EEA, new products for therapeutic indications that are authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EEA during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EEA. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EEA until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EEA. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 
38 


 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the EEA are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EEA a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During this ten-year orphan market exclusivity period, no marketing authorization application shall be accepted, and no marketing authorization shall be granted for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. A similar medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU for pediatric studies. The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (i) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. 
 The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific trial site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
 In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. The Regulation is anticipated to come into application in 2019. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the European Union will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS), a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue 
 
39 


  to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. The Clinical Trials Regulation will only become applicable six months after the European Commission confirms the full functionality of CTIS. Such a confirmation will only occur once CTIS is audited. The CTIS audit is currently planned for December 2020. 
 The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union, previously governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, is now governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018. While the Data Protection Directive did not apply to organizations based outside the EU, the GDPR has expanded its reach to include any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU. This expansion would incorporate any clinical trial activities in EU members states. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for sensitive information which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the EU. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States or other regions that have not been deemed to offer adequate privacy protections. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in fines of up to 4% of global revenues, or 20,000,000, whichever is greater. As a result of the implementation of the GDPR, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. 
 There is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU, or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated. Enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring GDPR compliance are onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Should we utilize third party distributors, compliance with such foreign governmental regulations would generally be the responsibility of such distributors, who may be independent contractors over whom we have limited control.
