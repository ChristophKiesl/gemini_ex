ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
GENERAL
 MediaCo Holding Inc. (“MediaCo” or the “Company”) is an Indiana corporation formed in 2019 by Emmis Communications Corporation (“Emmis”) to facilitate the sale of a controlling interest in Emmis’ radio stations WQHT-FM and WBLS-FM (the “Stations”) to SG Broadcasting LLC (“SG Broadcasting”), an affiliate of Standard General L.P. (“Standard General”) pursuant to an agreement entered into on June 28, 2019. The sale (the “Transaction”) closed on November 25, 2019. On November 26, 2019, the registration of the Company’s Class A common stock was declared effective, and the Company became subject to the periodic filing requirements of public registrants. As of December 31, 2019, all of the Company’s Class A common stock was held by Emmis and all the Company’s Class B common stock was held by SG Broadcasting. On January 17, 2020, Emmis distributed the Class A common stock pro rata to Emmis’ shareholders, making MediaCo a publicly traded company listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market.
 Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we”, “us” and “our” refer to MediaCo after giving effect to the contribution of the Stations by Emmis, as well as to the Stations while they were wholly owned by Emmis. Prior to November 25, 2019, MediaCo had not conducted any business as a separate company and had no assets or liabilities. The operations of the Stations contributed to us by Emmis on November 25, 2019, are presented as if they were our operations for all historical periods described and at the carrying value of such assets and liabilities reflected in Emmis’ books and records.
 On December 9, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the assumption from an affiliate of SG Broadcasting of an agreement to purchase FMG Valdosta, LLC and FMG Kentucky, LLC (“Fairway Outdoor”) from Fairway Outdoor Advertising Group, LLC (the “Fairway Acquisition”). Closing of the Fairway Acquisition occurred on December 13, 2019. FMG Valdosta, LLC and FMG Kentucky, LLC are outdoor advertising businesses that operate advertising displays principally across Kentucky, West Virginia, Florida and Georgia.
 Our assets primarily consist of two radio stations, WQHT-FM and WBLS-FM, which serve the New York City metropolitan area, as well as approximately 3,300 advertising structures in the Southeast (Valdosta) region and Mid-Atlantic (Kentucky) region of the United States. We derive our revenues primarily from radio and outdoor advertising sales, but we also generate revenues from events, including sponsorships and ticket sales.
 On October 25, 2019, in order to more closely align our operations and internal controls with standard market practice, our Board of Directors approved the change in our fiscal year end from the last day in February to December 31.
 BUSINESS STRATEGY
 We are committed to improving the operating results of our core assets while simultaneously seeking future growth opportunities in new businesses. Our strategy is focused on the following operating principles:
 Develop unique and compelling content and strong local brands
 Our established local media brands have achieved and sustained a leading position in their respective market segments over many years. Knowledge of the New York market and consistently producing unique and compelling content that meets the needs of our target audiences are critical to our success. As such, we make substantial investments in areas such as market research, data analysis and creative talent to ensure that our content remains relevant, has a meaningful impact on the communities we serve and reinforces the core brand image of each respective property.
 Extend the reach and relevance of our local brands through digital platforms
 In recent years, we have placed substantial emphasis on enhancing the distribution of our radio content through digital and mobile platforms. We believe these digital platforms offer excellent opportunities to further enhance the relationships we have with our audiences by allowing them to consume and share our content in new ways and providing us with new distribution channels for one-to-one communication with them.
 Deliver results to advertisers
 Competition for advertising revenue is intense and becoming more so. To remain competitive, we focus on sustaining and growing our radio audiences, optimizing our pricing strategy and developing innovative marketing programs for our clients that allow them to interact with our audiences in more direct and measurable ways. These programs often include elements such as on-air endorsements, events, contests, special promotions, Internet advertising, email marketing, interactive mobile advertising and online video. Our ability to deploy multi-touchpoint marketing programs allows us to deliver a stronger return-on-investment for our clients while simultaneously generating ancillary revenue streams for our media properties.
 Extend sales efforts into new market segments
 Given the competitive pressures in many of our “traditional” advertising categories, we have been expanding our network of advertiser relationships into not-for-profits, political advertising, corporate philanthropy, environmental initiatives and government agencies. These efforts in our radio segment primarily focus on the health care and education sectors. We believe our capabilities can address these clients’ under-served needs.

Enhance the efficiency of our operations
 We believe it is essential that we operate our businesses as efficiently as possible. We regularly review our business operations and reduce costs or realign resources as necessary. We have also invested in technology solutions to help further streamline our business processes.
 Pursue acquisition and investment opportunities
 We may pursue acquisitions or other investment opportunities in a variety of media-related businesses as well as a variety of other industries and market sectors. We believe that consummating such acquisitions and investments can be a valuable tool in our efforts to grow our business.
 RADIO STATIONS
 In the following table, “Market Rank by Revenue” is the ranking of the market revenue size of the principal radio market served by our stations among all radio markets in the United States. Market revenue rankings are from BIA’s Investing In Radio 2020, fourth edition. “Ranking in Primary Demographic Target” is the ranking of the station within its designated primary demographic target among all radio stations in its market based on the January 2021 Nielsen Audio, Inc. (“Nielsen”) Portable People Meter results. A “t” indicates the station tied with another station for the stated ranking. “Station Audience Share” represents a percentage generally computed by dividing the average number of persons in the primary demographic listening to a particular station during specified time periods by the average number of such persons in the primary demographic for all stations in the market area as determined by Nielsen.

STATION AND MARKET | MARKET RANK BY REVENUE | | FORMAT | | PRIMARY DEMOGRAPHIC TARGET AGES | | RANKING IN PRIMARY DEMOGRAPHIC TARGET | | STATION AUDIENCE SHARE
-------------------+------------------------+---+--------+--------------------------+---------------------------------+-------+---------------------------------------+----+-----------------------
New York, NY | | 2 | | | | | | | | 
WQHT-FM | | | | Hip-Hop | | 18-34 | | 3 | | 6.8
WBLS-FM | | | | Urban Adult Contemporary | | 25-54 | | 6t | | 4.7

RADIO ADVERTISING SALES
 Our stations derive their advertising revenue from local and regional advertising in the marketplaces in which they operate, as well as from the sale of national advertising. Local and most regional sales are made by a station’s sales staff. National sales are made by firms specializing in such sales, which are compensated on a commission-only basis. We believe that the volume of national advertising revenue tends to adjust to shifts in a station’s audience share position more rapidly than does the volume of local and regional advertising revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 16% of our total radio advertising revenues were derived from national sales, and 84% were derived from local sales.
NON-TRADITIONAL REVENUES
 Our stations are involved with numerous events in the market in which we operate that support the local community, entertain our audiences, and better connect our listeners with our stations and our advertisers. In most cases, a third party produces the event, which we help promote, and we sell certain sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers. In these situations, we do not bear financial risk on the success of the event. In limited cases, such as Hot 97's Summer Jam, we produce the event, including securing the performing artists and venue, and are primarily responsible for the financial risk and reward, including ticket and sponsorship sales associated with the event.
OUTDOOR ADVERTISING
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned and operated approximately 3,532 billboard advertising displays in 4 states. Our outdoor advertising businesses generally derive approximately 74% of billboard advertising net revenues from bulletin rentals, 15% from poster rentals, and 11% from digital billboard rentals.
 Bulletins are large, advertising structures (the most common size is fourteen feet high by forty-eight feet wide, or 672 square feet) consisting of panels on which advertising copy is displayed. We wrap advertising copy printed with computer-generated graphics on a single sheet of vinyl around the structure. To attract more attention, some of the panels may extend beyond the linear edges of the display face and may include three-dimensional embellishments. Because of their greater impact and higher cost, bulletins are usually located on major highways and target vehicular traffic. At December 31, 2020, we operated approximately 1,145 bulletin structures with a total of 2,736 faces. 
 We generally lease individually-selected bulletin space to advertisers for the duration of the contract (customarily 12 months). We also lease bulletins as part of a rotary plan under which we rotate the advertising copy from one bulletin location to another within a particular market at stated intervals (usually every sixty to ninety days) to achieve greater reach within that market.
 Posters are smaller advertising structures (the most common size is eleven feet high by twenty-three feet wide, or 250 square feet; we also operate junior posters, which are five feet high by eleven feet wide, or 55 square feet). Poster panels utilize a single flexible sheet of polyethylene material that inserts onto the face of the panel. Posters are concentrated on major traffic arteries and target vehicular traffic, and junior posters are concentrated on city streets and target hard-to-reach pedestrian traffic and nearby residents. At December 31, 2020, we operated approximately 349 poster displays with a total of 768 faces.
 5


We generally lease poster space for 4 to 52 weeks; determined by the advertiser’s campaign needs. Posters are sold in packages of Target Rating Point (“TRP”) levels, which determine the percentage of a target audience an advertiser needs to reach. A package may include a combination of poster locations in order to meet reach and frequency campaign goals.
 In addition to the traditional static displays, we also rent digital billboards. Digital billboards are large electronic light emitting diode (“LED”) displays (the most common sizes are fourteen feet high by forty-eight feet wide, or 672 square feet; ten and a half feet high by thirty six feet wide, or 378 square feet; and ten feet high by twenty-one feet wide, or 210 square feet) that are generally located on major traffic arteries and city streets. Digital billboards are capable of generating over one billion colors and vary in brightness based on ambient conditions. They display completely digital advertising copy from various advertisers in a slide show fashion, rotating each advertisement approximately every 6 to 8 seconds. At December 31, 2020, our inventory included 22 digital display billboards with a total of 28 faces. We own the physical structures on which the advertising copy is displayed. We build the structures on locations we either own or lease. 
 In the majority of our markets, our local production staffs perform the full range of activities required to create and install billboard advertising displays. Production work includes creating the advertising copy design and layout, coordinating its printing and installing the designs on the displays. Our design staff uses state-of-the-art technology to prepare creative, eye-catching displays for our tenants. We can also help with the strategic placement of advertisements throughout an advertiser’s market by using software that allows us to analyze the target audience and its demographics. Our artists also assist in developing marketing presentations, demonstrations and strategies to attract new tenant advertisers. Production revenue accounts for approximately 5% of the outdoor advertising business.
 NEW TECHNOLOGIES
  We believe that the growth of new technologies not only presents challenges, but also opportunities for broadcasters. The primary challenge is increased competition for the time and attention of our listeners. The primary opportunity is to further enhance the relationships we already have with our listeners by expanding products and services offered by our radio stations and to increase distribution to in-home devices like smart speakers, as well as portable devices like smartphones.
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
 We believe that to be successful, we must be integrally involved in the communities we serve. We see ourselves as community partners. To that end, our radio stations and outdoor businesses participate in many community programs, fundraisers and activities that benefit a wide variety of causes. Charitable organizations that have been the beneficiaries of our support include, among others, the Harlem Chamber of Commerce, the Sarcoidosis Foundation, New York Cares, American AIDS Foundation and the Queens Police Service Area Community Counsel.
 The National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation recognized WQHT-FM in New York for its outreach after Hurricane Sandy, both for the news coverage it provided and the relief efforts it organized in the weeks after the storm. In 2017, WBLS-FM won a national Crystal Award from the National Association of Broadcasters.
 INDUSTRY INVOLVEMENT
  We have an active leadership role in a wide range of industry organizations. Our senior executives have served in various capacities with industry associations, including as directors of the National Association of Broadcasters, the Radio Advertising Bureau, the Nielsen Audio Advisory Council, and the Media Financial Management Association. Our chief executive officer has been honored with the National Association of Broadcasters' "National Radio Award," was named Radio Ink's "Radio Executive of the Year," and was named the 2017 recipient of the Broadcasters Foundation of America's "Lowry Mays Excellence in Broadcasting Award." In 2018, our chief financial officer was awarded Media Financial Management's "Rainmaker Award" recognizing his efforts and contributions in helping Media Financial Management's growth initiatives. Our other management and on-air personalities have won numerous industry awards.
COMPETITION
 Radio broadcasting stations compete with the other broadcasting stations in their respective market areas, as well as with other advertising media such as newspapers, cable, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, the Internet, satellite radio, direct marketing and mobile and wireless device marketing. Competition within the broadcasting industry occurs primarily in individual market areas, so that a station in one market (e.g., New York) does not generally compete with stations in other markets (e.g., Los Angeles). Our stations face competition from other stations with substantial financial resources, including stations targeting the same demographic groups. In addition to management experience, factors that are material to competitive position include the station's rank in its market in terms of the number of listeners, authorized power, assigned frequency, audience characteristics, local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other stations in the market area. We attempt to improve our competitive position with programming and promotional campaigns aimed at the demographic groups targeted by our stations. We also seek to improve our position through sales efforts designed to attract advertisers that have done little or no radio advertising by emphasizing the effectiveness of radio advertising in increasing the advertisers' revenues. The policies and rules of the FCC permit certain joint ownership and joint operation of local stations. Our radio stations take advantage of these joint arrangements when appropriate in an effort to lower operating costs and to offer advertisers more attractive rates and services. Although we believe that each of our stations can compete effectively in its market, there can be no assurance that either of our stations will be able to maintain or increase its current audience ratings or advertising revenue market share.

Although the broadcasting industry is highly competitive, barriers to entry exist. The operation of a broadcasting station in the United States requires a license from the FCC. Also, the number of stations that can operate in a given market is limited by the availability of the frequencies that the FCC will license in that market, as well as by the FCC's multiple ownership rules regulating the number of stations that may be owned or controlled by a single entity, and cross ownership rules which limit the types of media properties in any given market that can be owned by the same person or company.
 Although the outdoor advertising industry has encountered a wave of consolidation, the industry remains fragmented. The industry is comprised of several large outdoor advertising and media companies with operations in multiple markets, as well as smaller, local companies like us that operate a limited number of structures in one or a few local markets.
 In selecting the form of media through which to advertise, advertisers evaluate their ability to target audiences having a specific demographic profile, lifestyle, brand or media consumption or purchasing behavior or audiences located in, or traveling through, a particular geography. Advertisers also compare the relative costs of available media, evaluating the number of impressions (potential viewings), exposure (the opportunity for advertising to be seen) and circulation (traffic volume in a market), as well as potential effectiveness, quality of related services (such as advertising copy design and layout) and customer service. In competing with other media, we believe that both radio and outdoor advertising are relatively more cost-efficient than other media, allowing advertisers to reach broader audiences and target specific geographic areas or demographic groups within markets.
 We believe that our strong emphasis on sales and customer service and our position as a major provider of advertising services in each of our primary markets enables us to compete effectively with the other outdoor advertising companies, as well as with other media, within those markets.
 EMPLOYEES
 As of December 31, 2020, WQHT-FM and WBLS-FM leased their employees from Emmis’ wholly owned subsidiary, Emmis Operating Company (“EOC”) under an employee leasing arrangement (the “Employee Leasing Agreement”). As of December 31, 2020, approximately 50 full-time employees and approximately 84 part-time employees were employed by EOC under the Employee Leasing Agreement to provide services for the Company. 
 Effective January 1, 2021, the Employee Leasing Agreement was terminated, and the Company hired all of the leased employees and assumed the employment and collective bargaining agreements related to leased employees. The Employee Leasing Agreement was terminated at the expiration of the initial term, so no early termination penalties were incurred.
 Our outdoor advertising business employed 55 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020.

The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
FEDERAL REGULATION OF BROADCASTING
 Radio broadcasting in the United States is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934 (the “Communications Act”), as amended in part by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”). Radio broadcasting is prohibited except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the public interest, convenience and necessity would be served by the grant 
 7


of such license. The FCC has the power to revoke licenses for, among other things, false statements made in FCC filings or willful or repeated violations of the Communications Act or of FCC rules. In general, the Communications Act provides that the FCC shall allocate broadcast licenses for radio stations so as to provide a fair, efficient and equitable distribution of service throughout the United States. The FCC determines the operating frequency, location and power of stations; regulates the equipment used by stations; and regulates numerous other areas of radio broadcasting pursuant to rules, regulations and policies adopted under authority of the Communications Act. The Communications Act, among other things, prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of an entity holding such a license without the prior approval of the FCC. Under the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of media that compete with broadcast stations.
 The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC regulations and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act as well as FCC rules, public notices and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations. Legislation has been introduced from time to time which would amend the Communications Act in various respects or otherwise affect the Company, and the FCC from time to time considers new regulations or amendments to its existing regulations. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted or whether new or amended FCC regulations will be adopted or what their effect would be on the Company.
 LICENSE RENEWAL. Radio stations operate pursuant to broadcast licenses that are ordinarily granted by the FCC for maximum terms of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application and approval by the FCC. The following table sets forth our current FCC license expiration dates in addition to the call letters, license classification, antenna elevation above average terrain, power and frequency of all owned stations as of December 31, 2020:
 
 
Radio Market | Stations | City of License | Frequency | | Expiration Date of License | | FCC Class | | Height Above Average Terrain (in feet) | | Power (in Kilowatts)
-------------+----------+-----------------+-----------+-------+----------------------------+-----------+-----------+---+----------------------------------------+-------+---------------------
New York, NY | WQHT-FM | New York, NY | | 97.1 | | June 2022 | | B | | 1,339 | | 6.7
 | WBLS-FM | New York, NY | | 107.5 | | June 2022 | | B | | 1,362 | | 4.2

 Under the Communications Act, upon the filing of an application for renewal of a station license, members of the public may apprise the FCC of the service the station has provided during the preceding license term and urge the denial of the application. If such a petition to deny presents information from which the FCC concludes (or if the FCC concludes on its own motion) that there is a “substantial and material” question as to whether grant of the renewal application would be in the public interest under applicable rules and policy, the FCC may conduct a hearing on specified issues to determine whether the renewal application should be granted. The Communications Act provides for the grant of a renewal application upon a finding by the FCC that the licensee:
  
• | has served the public interest, convenience and necessity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | has committed no serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC rules; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | has committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC rules which would constitute a pattern of abuse.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If the FCC cannot make such a finding, it may deny the renewal application, and only then may the FCC consider competing applications for the same frequency. In a vast majority of cases, the FCC renews a broadcast license even when petitions to deny have been filed against the renewal application.
 REVIEW OF OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS. The FCC is required by statute to review its broadcast ownership rules on a quadrennial basis (i.e., every four years) and to repeal or modify rules that are no longer “necessary in the public interest.”
 Despite several such reviews and appellate remands, the FCC’s rules limiting the number of radio stations that may be commonly owned in a local market have remained largely intact since their initial adoption following the 1996 Act. The FCC’s previous ownership reviews have been subject to litigation. The most recent court decisions were issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in September and November 2019 and concerned the FCC’s 2014 review. On April 17, 2020, the FCC and industry intervenors filed petitions for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the lower court’s rulings preventing the FCC’s efforts to update its broadcast ownership rules from going into effect. Those petitions were granted on October 2, 2020, and oral argument was heard on January 19, 2021. While the proceeding remains pending before the Supreme Court, the FCC’s rules that were in effect prior to February 2018 remain in effect. The FCC initiated its 2018 quadrennial review in December 2018 and that proceeding remains pending. We cannot predict whether the Supreme Court appeal or 2018 quadrennial review proceeding will result in modifications of the ownership rules or the impact (if any) that such modifications would have on our business.
 Attribution of Ownership Interests:
 In applying its ownership rules, the FCC has developed specific criteria that it uses to determine whether a certain ownership interest or other relationship with an FCC licensee is significant enough to be “attributable” or “cognizable” under its rules, such that there would be a violation of the FCC’s rules where such person or entity holds attributable interests in more than the permitted number of stations or a prohibited combination of outlets in the same market. The FCC’s regulations generally deem the following relationships and interests to be attributable for purposes of its ownership restrictions:

• | all officer and director positions in a licensee or its direct/indirect parent(s);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | voting stock interests of at least 5% (or 20%, if the holder is a passive institutional investor, i.e. , a mutual fund, insurance company or bank);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company where the limited partner or member has not been “insulated” from the media-related activities of the LP or LLC pursuant to specific FCC criteria;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8


 
• | equity and/or debt interests which, in the aggregate, exceed 33% of the total asset value of a station or other media entity (the “equity/debt plus policy”), if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of the station’s total weekly programming (usually pursuant to a time brokerage, local marketing or network affiliation agreement) or is a same-market media entity (i.e., broadcast station or newspaper).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To assess whether a voting stock interest in a direct or indirect parent corporation of a broadcast licensee is attributable, the FCC uses a “multiplier” analysis in which non-controlling voting stock interests are deemed proportionally reduced at each non-controlling link in a multi-corporation ownership chain.
 Ownership-rule conflicts could require divestitures by either the Company or the affected shareholders, officers or directors. Such conflicts could also result in the Company being unable to obtain FCC consents necessary for future acquisitions. Conversely, the Company’s media interests could operate to restrict other media investments by shareholders having or acquiring an interest in the Company.
 Local Radio Ownership:
 The local radio ownership rule limits the number of commercial radio stations in a radio market in which a person or entity may hold an attributable interest based on the number of radio stations in that market:

• | if the market has 45 or more radio stations, one entity may own up to eight stations, not more than five of which may be in the same service (AM or FM);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if the market has between 30 and 44 radio stations, one entity may own up to seven stations, not more than four of which may be in the same service;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if the market has between 15 and 29 radio stations, one entity may own up to six stations, not more than four of which may be in the same service; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if the market has 14 or fewer radio stations, one entity may own up to five stations, not more than three of which may be in the same service, however one entity may not own more than 50% of the stations in the market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The New York radio market has more than 45 radio stations.
 For purposes of applying these numerical limits, the FCC has adopted rules with respect to (i) so-called local marketing agreements, or “LMAs,” by which the licensee of one radio station provides programming for another licensee’s radio station in the same market and sells all of the advertising within that programming and (ii) so-called joint sale agreements, or “JSAs,” by which the licensee of one station sells the advertising time on another station in the market. Under these rules, an entity that owns one or more radio stations in a market and programs more than 15% of the broadcast time, or sells more than 15% of the advertising time, on another radio station in the same market pursuant to an LMA or JSA is generally required to count the station toward its media ownership limits even though it does not own the station. As a result, in a market where we own one or more radio stations, we generally cannot provide programming to another station under an LMA, or sell advertising on another station pursuant to a JSA, if we could not acquire that station under the local radio ownership rule. 
 In the 2018 quadrennial review order, the FCC is requesting comment on all aspects of the local radio ownership rule, including whether the rule in its current form remains necessary in the public interest.
 Cross-Media Ownership:
 The newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits an individual or entity from having an attributable interest in either a radio or television station and a daily newspaper located in the same market, subject to certain exceptions and with waivers available in particular cases.
 The radio/television cross-ownership rule limits common ownership of television stations and same market radio stations. In general, an individual or entity may hold attributable interests in one television station and up to seven same-market radio stations (or two television stations and up to six same-market radio stations), depending on the number of independently owned radio, television and other specified media “voices” in the market.
 Alien Ownership: Under the Communications Act, no FCC license may be held by a corporation if more than one-fifth of its capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, a foreign government or representative thereof, or an entity organized under the laws of a foreign country (collectively, “Non-U.S. Persons”). Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC license may be granted to an entity directly or indirectly controlled by another entity of which more than one-fourth of its capital stock is owned or voted by Non-U.S. Persons if the FCC finds that the public interest will be served by the denial of such license. The FCC has adopted rules to simplify and streamline the process for requesting authority to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees and has revised the methodology that publicly traded broadcasters must use to assess their compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions. The foregoing restrictions on alien ownership apply in modified form to other types of business organizations, including partnerships and limited liability companies. Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Code of By-Laws authorize the Board of Directors to prohibit such restricted alien ownership, voting or transfer of capital stock as would cause the Company to violate the Communications Act or FCC regulations.
 ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS OF CONTROL. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant such approval, the FCC considers a number of factors, including compliance with the various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the “character” of the assignee or transferee and those persons holding attributable interests therein and compliance with the Communications Act’s limitations on alien ownership as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements. When evaluating an assignment or transfer of control application, the FCC is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by an assignment of the broadcast license or transfer of control of the licensee to a party other than the assignee or transferee specified in the application.
 9


PROGRAMMING AND OPERATION. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest.” Beginning in the late 1970s, the FCC gradually relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station’s community of license. However, licensees are still required to present programming that is responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness.
 Federal law prohibits the broadcast of obscene material at any time and the broadcast of indecent material during specified time periods.  Federal law also imposes sponsorship identification (or “payola”) requirements, which mandate the disclosure of information concerning programming the airing of which is paid for by third parties. The company may receive letters of inquiry or other notifications concerning alleged violations of the FCC’s rules at its stations. We cannot predict the outcome of any complaint proceeding or investigation or the extent or nature of any future FCC enforcement action.
 Stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various rules promulgated under the Communications Act that regulate, among other things, political advertising, sponsorship identification, equal employment opportunities, contest and lottery advertisements, and technical operations, including limits on radio frequency radiation.
 Failure to observe FCC rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary fines, the grant of “short-term” (less than the maximum term) license renewals or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license.
 ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PROPOSED CHANGES. The FCC has adopted rules implementing a low power FM (“LPFM”) service, and over 2100 such stations have been licensed. In November 2007, the FCC adopted rules that, among other things, enhance LPFM’s interference protection from subsequently-authorized full-service stations. Congress then passed legislation eliminating certain minimum distance separation requirements between full-power and LPFM stations, thereby reducing the interference protection afforded to full-power FM stations. As required by the legislation, the FCC in January 2012 submitted a report to Congress indicating that the results of a statutorily mandated economic study indicated that, on the whole, LPFM stations do not currently have, and in the future are unlikely to have, a demonstrable economic impact on full-service commercial FM radio stations. The FCC has since modified its rules to permit the processing of additional LPFM applications and to implement the legislative requirements regarding interference protection, and has accepted applications seeking authority to construct or make major changes to LPFM facilities. Although to date there have been very few, if any, instances of LPFM stations interfering with full-power radio stations, we cannot predict whether any LPFM stations will actually interfere with the coverage of our radio stations in the future.
 The FCC also previously authorized the launch and operation of a satellite digital audio radio service (“SDARS”) system. The country’s single SDARS operator, Sirius XM, provides nationwide programming service as well as channels that provide local traffic and weather information for major cities.
 In addition, the FCC permits terrestrial digital audio broadcasting (“DAB,” also known as high definition radio or “HD Radio®”) by FM stations, and in October 2020, adopted rules permitting all-digital operations by AM stations. 
 In order to broadcast musical compositions or to stream them over the Internet, we must pay royalties to copyright owners of musical compositions (typically, songwriters and publishers). These copyright owners often rely on organizations known as performing rights organizations, which negotiate licenses with copyright users for the public performance of their compositions, collect royalties, and distribute them to copyright owners. The three major performing rights organizations, from which the Company has licenses and to which we pay royalties, are the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”), and SESAC, Inc. These rates are set periodically, are often negotiated by organizations acting on behalf of broadcasters, and may increase in the future. It also is possible that songwriters or publishers may disassociate with these performing rights organizations, or that additional such organizations could emerge in the future. In 2013 a new performing rights organization, named Global Music Rights (“GMR”), was formed. GMR has obtained the rights to certain high-value copyrights and is seeking to negotiate individual licensing agreements with radio stations for songs within its repertoire. GMR and the Radio Music License Committee, Inc. (“RMLC”), which negotiates music licensing fees with performance rights organizations on behalf of many radio stations, have initiated antitrust litigation against one another, which remains pending. In addition, there has been litigation concerning whether the consent decrees between the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and major performance rights organizations require so-called “full-work” licenses (which would allow a license-holder to play all of the works in a performance rights organization’s repertoire). The DOJ is also reviewing consent decrees governing ASCAP and BMI to determine whether those consent decrees should be modified.  If a significant number of musical composition copyright owners withdraw from the established performing rights organizations, if new performing rights organizations form to license compositions that are not already licensed, or if the consent decrees between the DOJ and ASCAP/BMI are materially modified or eliminated, our royalty rates or negotiation costs could increase. Our royalty rates or negotiation costs could also change as a result of GMR/RMLC litigation or the resolution of the full-work licensing issue.
 In order to stream music over the Internet, MediaCo must also obtain licenses and pay royalties to the owners of copyrights in sound recordings (typically, artists and record companies). These royalties are in addition to royalties for Internet streaming that must be paid to performance rights organizations. The Copyright Royalty Board (“CRB”) recently completed its proceeding to set rates for the 2016-2020 license period. The CRB set a rate during this period for performances by non-subscription noninteractive services of 0.17 cent per listener per song, and a rate for noninteractive subscription services of 0.22 cent per listener per song, both of which are subject to changes that mirror changes in the Consumer Price Index. The CRB’s 2016-2020 rates represent a decrease from the 2015 CRB rates applicable to broadcasters and other webcasters. A proceeding to establish the rates for 2021-2025 began in 2019.

In addition, lawsuits have been filed under various state laws challenging the right of digital audio transmission services and broadcasters to publicly perform or reproduce sound recordings fixed prior to February 15, 1972 (“pre-1972 sound recordings”) without a license. Federal legislation signed into law in October 2018 applies a statutory licensing regime to pre-1972 sound recordings similar to that which governs post-1972 sound recordings. Among other things, the new law extends remedies for copyright infringement to owners of pre-1972 sound recordings when recordings are used without authorization. The public performance right that the new law creates for pre-1972 sound recordings streamed online may increase our licensing costs.
 Legislation also has regularly been introduced in Congress that would require the payment of performance royalties to artists, musicians, or record companies whose music is played on terrestrial radio stations, ending a long-standing copyright law exception. If enacted, such legislation could have an adverse impact on the cost of music programming.
 Congress and the FCC also have under consideration, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of additional matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation, ownership and profitability of our broadcast stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our broadcast stations and/or affect our ability to acquire additional broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions. Such matters include, but are not limited to:
  
• | proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to repeal or modify some or all of the FCC’s multiple ownership rules and/or policies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to impose requirements intended to promote broadcasters’ service to their local communities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to change rules relating to political broadcasting;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | technical and frequency allocation matters;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | proposals to modify service and technical rules for digital radio, including possible additional public interest requirements for terrestrial digital audio broadcasters;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to tighten safety guidelines relating to radio frequency radiation exposure;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals permitting FM stations to accept formerly impermissible interference;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to modify broadcasters’ public interest obligations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals, including by states, to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenses by advertisers; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | proposals to regulate violence and hate speech in broadcasts.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 We cannot predict whether any proposed changes will be adopted, what other matters might be considered in the future, or what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business.
 The foregoing is only a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC regulations. Reference should be made to the Communications Act as well as FCC regulations, public notices and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.
 REGULATION OF OUTDOOR ADVERTISING
 Outdoor advertising is subject to government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. Regulations generally restrict the size, spacing, lighting and other aspects of advertising structures and pose a significant barrier to entry and expansion in many markets. Federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act of 1965, 28 U.S.C. § 131, regulates outdoor advertising on Federal-aid Primary, Interstate and National Highway Systems roads, and it directs states to provide “effective control” of outdoor advertising along these roads, and to implement a compliance program and state standards regarding size, spacing, and lighting. The states in which we operate have implemented billboard control statutes and regulations. Additionally, municipal and county governments also have implemented sign controls as part of their zoning laws and building codes, and some local governments prohibit construction of new billboards or allow new construction only to replace existing structures. These state, local, and municipal laws and standards may be modified over time, and may have an adverse effect on our business. We closely evaluate laws and regulations that we believe unlawfully restrict our constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact our outdoor advertising business to determine whether to bring legal challenges.  
 We may be required to remove billboards in some circumstances, and may not always be able to obtain compensation for the removal.  As some examples, state governments have purchased and removed billboards for beautification, and may do so again in the future. Additionally, state and municipal governments have laid claim to property under the power of eminent domain and forced the removal of billboards. State governments have also required removal of billboards that have been damaged, and can require removal of signs deemed to be illegal at the owner’s expense and without compensation from the state. Local governments also have attempted to force removal of legal but currently nonconforming billboards under a concept called amortization by which a governmental body asserts that a billboard operator has earned sufficient compensation by continued operation over time, which has been upheld in some instances. 
 We have also deployed and will continue to deploy digital billboards that display static digital advertising copy from various advertisers that change every 6 to 8 seconds. These may be restricted by existing regulations, and existing regulations that currently do not apply to them by their terms could be revised or new regulations could be enacted to impose greater restrictions. These regulations may impose greater restrictions on digital billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety. On December 30, 2013, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration released the results of a study concluding that the presence of digital billboards did not appear to be related to a decrease in looking at the road ahead, though it cautioned that it did not present definitive answers to the research questions investigated. The results of this or other studies may result in regulations at any government level that impose greater restrictions on digital billboards.
