Overview

We are the leading North American producer of coated papers, which are used primarily in commercial print, magazines, catalogs, high-end advertising brochures and annual reports, among other media and marketing publications. We produce a wide range of products, ranging from coated freesheet and coated groundwood, to specialty papers, packaging papers, inkjet and digital papers, supercalendered papers and uncoated freesheet. We also produce and sell bleached and unbleached market kraft pulp, which is used to manufacture paper and packaging products.
As of the date of this report, we operate seven paper machines at four mills located in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. The mills have an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately 1,970,000 tons of paper. 
We sell and market our products to approximately 300 customers which comprise approximately 1,300 end-user accounts. We have long-standing relationships with many leading magazine and catalog publishers, commercial printers, specialty retail merchandisers and paper merchants. Our relationships with many of our large customers average more than 20 years. We reach our end-users through several distribution channels, including direct sales, commercial printers, paper merchants and brokers.
Sale of Androscoggin Mill and Stevens Point Mill
On November 11, 2019, we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement, or the “Purchase Agreement,” with Pixelle Specialty Solution LLC, or “Pixelle,” whereby we agreed to sell to Pixelle, or the “Pixelle Sale,” all of the outstanding membership interests in Verso Androscoggin, LLC an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Verso and the entity that, as of the closing date, held all the assets primarily related to Verso’s Androscoggin Mill located in Jay, Maine, and Stevens Point Mill, located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. The transaction was approved by Verso’s stockholders on January 31, 2020 and closed on February 10, 2020. As consideration for the Pixelle Sale, (i) we received approximately $346 million in cash, which reflects certain adjustments in respect of our estimates of cash, indebtedness and working capital of Verso Androscoggin, LLC as of the closing date, and (ii) Pixelle assumed approximately $35 million of Verso’s unfunded pension liabilities. The consideration for the sale will be subject to final post-closing adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Pixelle Sale reduced the aggregate annual production capacity of our mills by approximately 660,000 tons. The Androscoggin and Stevens Point Mills together represented approximately 22% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 (see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements).
Luke Mill Closure
On April 30, 2019, we announced the permanent shutdown of our paper mill in Luke, Maryland in response to the continuing decline in customer demand for the grades of coated freesheet paper produced at the Luke Mill, along with rising input costs, a significant influx of imports and rising compliance costs and infrastructure challenges associated with environmental regulation. We completed the shutdown and closure of the Luke Mill in June 2019. The shutdown of the Luke Mill reduced our coated freesheet production capacity by approximately 450,000 tons and eliminated approximately 675 positions at the Luke Mill.
Changes to Directors and Officers
On April 5, 2019, B. Christopher DiSantis ceased being our Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors appointed Leslie T. Lederer as our Interim Chief Executive Officer. Effective November 11, 2019, Mr. Lederer resigned as Interim Chief Executive Officer and our Board of Directors appointed Adam St. John to serve as our Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors.
On January 30, 2020, we entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Lapetus Capital II LLC, or, together with its affiliates, including Atlas Holdings LLC, or “Atlas,” and Blue Wolf Capital Advisors IV, LLC, or, together with its affiliates, or “Blue 
Wolf,” and certain of their respective affiliates, which settled the proxy contest with respect to our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on January 31, 2020, or the “Annual Meeting.”
Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, Verso, Atlas and Blue Wolf agreed to take the necessary actions for Verso’s Board of Directors to consist of the following individuals immediately subsequent to our Annual Meeting: Dr. Robert K. Beckler, Marvin Cooper, Sean T. Erwin, Jeffrey E. Kirt, Randy J. Nebel, Nancy M. Taylor and Adam St. John. Immediately following the certification of voting result of the Annual Meeting on February 6, 2020, Marvin Cooper was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Board. In addition, subsequent to the Annual Meeting, the Board appointed: (i) Mr. Erwin as Chairman of the Board, (ii) Messrs. Cooper, Kirt (Chair) and Nebel and Ms. Taylor to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, (iii) Dr. Beckler, Mr. Cooper and Mr. Nebel (Chair) to the Compensation Committee, and (iv) Messrs. Erwin and Kirt and Ms. Taylor (Chair) to the Audit Committee.
Termination of Rights Plan
On February 18, 2020, our Board of Directors terminated the limited duration stockholder rights plan previously adopted on June 16, 2019.
Industry

Based on total industry 2019 sales and other market research, we estimate the size of the global coated paper industry to be approximately 35 million tons, including approximately 5 million tons in North America. Coated paper is used primarily in media and marketing applications, including catalogs, magazines and commercial printing applications, which include high-end advertising brochures, annual reports and direct mail advertising. Demand is generally driven by North American advertising and print media trends, which in turn have historically been correlated with growth in gross domestic product. The coated paper industry has been facing a decline in demand driven primarily by the growth in digital media (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - The paper industry has been facing a long-term structural decline and our profitability has been adversely impacted by such decline”).
In North America, coated papers are classified by brightness and fall into five grades, labeled No. 1 to No. 5, with No. 1 having the highest brightness level and No. 5 having the lowest brightness level. Papers graded No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 are typically coated freesheet grades. No. 4 and No. 5 papers are predominantly grades containing groundwood. Coated groundwood grades are the preferred grades for catalogs and magazines, while coated freesheet is more commonly used in commercial print applications.
Within the paper industry, specialty papers are products which are given unique characteristics in their manufacturing, converting or processing and that have properties suitable for special purposes or custom engineered applications. Specialty papers have unique functional properties and are usually produced in relatively small quantities for a specific product, function or end-use requirement. Commercial and development activities rely largely on defining the unique characteristics of an application, in contrast with other substrates. We have focused on label and converting, flexible packaging and technical paper applications within the specialty papers market. 
Products

We manufacture paper and board products that serve the graphic papers, specialty papers and packaging papers markets. In addition, we manufacture pulp for both internal use and external sales.
Graphic papers. We produce a comprehensive portfolio of graphic paper products for various applications across our customer base. The graphic papers market includes coated freesheet, uncoated freesheet, coated groundwood and supercalendered papers. Freesheet papers are made from bleached kraft pulp, which is produced using a chemical process to break apart wood fibers and dissolve impurities such as lignin. The use of bleached kraft pulp results in a bright, smooth paper with excellent print qualities. Coated freesheet papers contain primarily kraft pulp with less than 10% mechanical pulp in its composition, and is therefore well-suited for high-end commercial applications, premium magazines, catalogs and direct mail. Groundwood papers include a fiber component produced through a mechanical pulping process. The use of such fiber results in a bulkier and more opaque paper that is better suited for applications where lighter weights and/or higher stiffness are required. In addition to mechanical pulp, groundwood papers typically include a kraft pulp component to improve brightness and print quality. Groundwood papers are coated (coated groundwood) for higher quality applications such as catalogs and magazines, or may contain a high percentage of filler content and are calendared (supercalendered) for higher volume applications such as retail inserts. Graphic papers revenues have been declining primarily due to the focus on digital media as opposed to traditional print 
advertising. Revenues from our graphic papers sales represented 62%, 62% and 60% of our total annual net sales for 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Specialty papers. We offer customized product solutions for our customers by producing paper grades with customer-specified weight, brightness and pulp mix characteristics, providing customers with cost benefits and/or brand differentiation. Our specialty papers portfolio, which includes a wide range of bleached and natural specialty papers, focuses on functionality, printability and innovative solutions to provide over 200 specialty paper grades for use in an array of applications including label and converting, flexible packaging and technical papers. End-uses range from beverage container labels to oil and grease resistant food packaging to pressure sensitive labels and thermal printing papers. Revenues from our specialty papers sales have increased as we continue to focus on new product development and productivity improvements to lessen our overall exposure to the declines in demand in the graphic papers market. Revenues from our specialty papers sales represented 30%, 31% and 31% of our total annual net sales for 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Packaging papers. Our packaging papers offerings include coated bleached board, kraft linerboard (also referred to as containerboard) and other kraft products. Packaging papers are a strategic growth area for Verso as we transform our total company grade mix to lessen our dependency on graphic printing and writing papers, which have been experiencing a prolonged decline in demand. Coated bleached board is manufactured similar to coated freesheet papers utilizing at least 90% bleached kraft pulp and is typically greater than one-hundredth of an inch in thickness while delivering functionality and convertibility. This product is used in applications such as packaging for point-of-purchase items or as laminated paperboard for box packaging where brand differentiation is desired. Containerboard, commonly called linerboard (outer) and medium (inner), is manufactured utilizing unbleached kraft pulp and is used principally as the outer and inner layers of corrugated boxes. Kraft paper is manufactured with both bleached and unbleached kraft pulp and has a wide variety of end uses, the most recognizable of which include grocery sacks, shopping bags and fast food bags. Revenues from our packaging papers sales represented 2%, 2% and 4% of our total annual net sales for 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Pulp. We produce and sell Northern Bleached Hardwood Kraft, or “NBHK” pulp. NBHK pulp is produced through the chemical kraft process using hardwoods. Hardwoods typically have shorter length fibers than softwoods and are used in a variety of end-use applications. NBHK describes pulp produced using a chemical process, whereby hardwood chips are combined with chemicals and steam to separate the wood fibers. The fibers are then washed and pressure screened to remove the chemicals and lignin which originally held the fibers together. Finally, the pulp is bleached to the necessary whiteness and brightness. NBHK pulp is used in applications where a brighter and whiter fiber based product is required. We can also offer Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft pulp, de-inked recycled pulp and unbleached virgin kraft pulp to help meet specific customer requirements. Revenues from our pulp sales represented 6%, 5% and 5% of our total annual net sales for 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Subsequent to the Pixelle Sale, the mix of revenue between graphic papers and specialty papers changed significantly due to the volume of specialty paper products previously produced at our Androscoggin and Stevens Point Mills. As a result of the Pixelle Sale, our mix of revenue has reverted to a higher concentration of graphic paper products. We continue to focus on product development and productivity improvements to lessen our overall exposure to the decline in demand of graphic papers.
Manufacturing

As of the date of this report, we operate seven paper machines at four mills located in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. The mills have an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately 1,970,000 tons of paper. In 2019, we shut down our paper mill in Luke, Maryland and agreed to sell our mills located in Jay, Maine and Stevens Point, Wisconsin, which sale closed on February 10, 2020. We believe our graphic, packaging and specialty papers mills are among the most efficient and lowest cost paper mills in North America based on the cash cost of delivery to Chicago, Illinois. We attribute our manufacturing efficiency, in part, to investments made in our mills, our R-GAP manufacturing benchmarking and our cost improvement program. Our facilities are strategically located within close proximity to major publication printing customers, which affords us the ability to deliver our products more quickly and cost-effectively.
The following table provides key information about our mills and operating paper machines’ capacity as of the date of this report. As discussed under “Overview” above, on February 10, 2020, we completed the sale of our Androscoggin Mill located in Jay, Maine and our Stevens Point Mill, located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, which had annual production capacity of 450,000 tons and 210,000 tons, respectively. 

Mill/Location | Product/Paper Grades | PaperMachines | | Annual ProductionCapacity(in tons)(1)
Duluth, Minnesota | Supercalendered papers | | 1 | | 270,000
Escanaba, Michigan | Coated, specialty and uncoated papers | | 3 | | 730,000
Quinnesec, Michigan | Coated papers | | | | 430,000
Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin | Coated and packaging papers | | | | 540,000


(1) | Luke Mill (closed) annual production capacity of 450,000 tons is not included in our total paper production capacity.

The basic raw material of the papermaking process is wood pulp. The first stage of papermaking involves converting wood logs to pulp through either a mechanical or chemical process. Before logs can be processed into pulp, they are passed through a debarking drum to remove the bark. Once separated, the bark is burned as fuel in bark boilers. The wood logs are composed of small cellulose fibers which are bound together by a glue-like substance called lignin. The cellulose fibers are then separated from each other through either a mechanical or a kraft pulping process.

After the pulping phase, the fiber furnish is run onto the forming fabric of the paper machine. On the forming fabric, the fibers become interlaced, forming a mat of paper, and much of the water is extracted. The paper web then goes through a pressing and drying process to extract the remaining water. After drying, the web goes through a series of on machine and off machine finishing and converting processes that impact product specific attributes to ensure excellent downstream performance. Finally, the paper is wrapped, labeled and shipped.
Our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Consolidated Water Power Company, or “CWPCo,” provides electricity to our Wisconsin Rapids Mill in central Wisconsin. CWPCo has 33.3 megawatts of generating capacity on 39 generators located in five hydroelectric plants on the Wisconsin River. CWPCo is a regulated public utility and also provides electricity to a small number of residential, light commercial and industrial customers.

We utilize a manufacturing excellence program, called R-GAP, to take advantage of the financial opportunities that exist between the current or historical performance of our mills and the best performance possible given usual and normal constraints (i.e., configuration, geographical and capital constraints). Our continuous improvement process is designed to lower our cost position and enhance operating efficiency through reduced consumption of energy and material inputs, reduced spending on indirect costs and improved productivity, product quality and safety. The program utilizes benchmarking data to identify improvement initiatives and establish performance targets. Detailed action plans are used to monitor the execution of these initiatives and calculate the amount saved. We also use multi-variable testing, lean manufacturing, center of excellence teams, source-of-loss initiatives and best practice sharing to constantly improve our manufacturing processes and products. Since 2001, the Quinnesec Mill has been recognized in the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Voluntary Protection Program as a Star facility. The Michigan Voluntary Protection Program Star award is the state’s highest recognition for workplace safety programs and performance. Each year we develop and implement new efforts to continue our safety improvement and share our successes through the mentoring aspects of this important program.
Raw Materials and Suppliers

Our key cost inputs in the papermaking process are wood fiber, chemicals and energy.

Wood Fiber. We source our wood fiber from a broad group of timberland and sawmill owners located in the regions around our mills. Our cost to purchase wood is affected directly by the market price of wood in our regional markets and indirectly by the effect of higher fuel cost of logging and transportation of timber to our facilities. While we have fiber supply agreements in place that ensure delivery of a substantial portion of our wood requirements, purchases under these agreements are typically at market rates.

Chemicals. Chemicals utilized in the manufacturing of coated papers include latex, clay, starch, calcium carbonate, caustic soda, sodium chlorate and titanium dioxide. We purchase these chemicals from a variety of suppliers and are not dependent on 
6

any single supplier to satisfy our chemical needs. We expect imbalances in supply and demand to periodically create volatility in prices for certain chemicals.
Energy. We produce a significant portion of our energy needs for our paper mills from sources such as waste wood, waste water, hydroelectric facilities, liquid biomass from our pulping process and internal energy cogeneration facilities. Our external energy purchases vary across each of our mills and include fuel oil, natural gas, coal and electricity. Our overall energy expenditures are mitigated by our internal energy production capacity and ability to switch between certain energy sources. The use of derivative contracts is also considered as part of our risk management strategy to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in energy prices. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We reach our end-users through several channels, including merchants, brokers, printers and direct sales to end-users. We sell our products to approximately 300 customers which comprise approximately 1,300 end-user accounts. 
Sales to End-Users. In 2019, we sold 46% of our paper products directly to end-users, most of which are specialty converters and catalog and magazine publishers. These customers are typically large, sophisticated buyers who have the scale, resources and expertise to procure paper directly from manufacturers. We also focus on containerboard converters and general commercial print end-users. Customers for our pulp products are mostly other paper manufacturers.

Sales to Brokers and Merchants. Our largest indirect paper sales by volume are through brokers and merchants who resell the paper to end-users. In 2019, our sales to brokers and merchants represented 38% of our net sales. Brokers typically act as an intermediary between paper manufacturers and smaller end-users who do not have the scale or resources to cost effectively procure paper directly from manufacturers. The majority of the paper sold to brokers is resold to catalog publishers. We work closely with brokers to achieve market share in the catalog, magazine and insert end-user markets through collaborative selling.

Merchants are similar to brokers in that they act as an intermediary between the manufacturer and the end-user. However, merchants generally take physical delivery of the product and keep inventory on hand. Merchants tend to deal with smaller end-users that lack the scale to warrant direct delivery from the manufacturer. Coated freesheet comprises the majority of our sales to merchants. In most cases, because they are relatively small, the ultimate end-users of paper sold through merchants are generally regional or local commercial printers. Containerboard is also sold primarily through merchants to converters (box plants and sheet feeder plants).
Sales to Printers. In 2019, our sales to printers represented 16% of our net sales. The majority of these sales were to the two largest publication printers in the United States. Printers also effectively act as an intermediary between manufacturers and end-users in that they directly source paper for printing/converting and then resell it to their customers as a finished product.

The majority of our paper products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facilities to the printer or converter, regardless of the sales channel. In addition, we maintain a network of distribution centers located in the West, Midwest, South and Northeast close to our customer base to provide quick delivery. The majority of our pulp products are delivered to our customers’ paper mills.

Our sales force is organized around our sales channels. We maintain an active dialogue with all of our major customers and track product performance and demand across grades. We have a team of sales representatives and marketing professionals organized into three major sales groups that correspond with our sales channels: direct sales support; support to brokers and merchants; and printer support.

Many of our customers provide us with forecasts of their paper needs, which allows us to plan our production runs in advance, optimizing production over our integrated mill system and thereby reducing costs and increasing overall efficiency. Generally, our sales agreements do not extend beyond the calendar year and provide for quarterly or semiannual price adjustments based on market price movements.

Customers

We participate in the graphic papers, specialty papers, packaging papers and pulp markets and have developed long-standing relationships with many premier customers in these areas. Our relationships with our ten largest customers average more than 20 years. Our two largest customers, Veritiv Corporation and Central National-Gottesman, together accounted for 25% of our net sales in 2019. In 2019, our ten largest customers (including Veritiv Corporation and Central National-Gottesman) together accounted for 60% of our net sales. Our key customers in the graphic papers market include Central National-Gottesman, Quad/Graphics, Inc., Meredith/Time, Veritiv Corporation and Midland Paper. Our key customers in the specialty papers market include Avery Dennison, UPM Raflatac and Mactac.
Research and Development

The primary function of our research and development efforts is to work with customers in developing and modifying products to accommodate their evolving needs and to identify cost-saving opportunities within our operations. Over the past several years, examples of our research and development efforts include innovative and performance-driven products for the flexible packaging, label and specialty printing markets.
Intellectual Property

We have several patents and patent applications in the United States and various foreign countries. These patents and patent applications generally relate to various paper manufacturing methods and equipment which may become commercially viable in the future. We also have trademarks for our name, Verso®, as well as for our products such as Sterling®, Futura®, Anthem Plus®, Productolith®, Influence®, Liberty® and Voyager®. In addition to the intellectual property that we own, we license a significant portion of the intellectual property used in our business on a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive basis from International Paper.
Competition
Our business is highly competitive. A significant number of North American competitors produce coated papers, specialty papers, packaging papers and pulp, and several overseas manufacturers export to North America. We compete based on a number of factors, including price, product availability, product quality, customer service, breadth of product offerings, timeliness of product delivery, market presence and degree of forward integration.
Foreign competition in North America is affected by the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies’ market prices in North America and other markets, worldwide supply and demand and the cost of ocean-going freight.

While our product offering is broad in terms of grades produced (from coated and uncoated graphical grades, including web and sheeted products, to highly technical specialty grades), our largest offering is in the coated freesheet category, with about two-thirds in web form and one-third in sheets. This strategy is driven primarily by our alignment with the commercial print market with a secondary focus on catalogs and magazines for our coated freesheet grades. As of December 31, 2019, our principal competitors include Resolute Forest Products, UPM-Kymmene Corporation, Nine Dragons Paper and Sappi Limited, all of which have North American operations. UPM, Sappi and Nine Dragons Paper are headquartered overseas and also have overseas manufacturing facilities.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 3,700 employees. Approximately 65% of our hourly workforce is represented by 16 local branches of the following unions: the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Services Workers International Union; the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; the Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America; the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; the Office and Professional Employees International Union; and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry. On February 28, 2019, the United Steelworkers, or “USW,” who represent employees at four Verso sites, voted to ratify a new Master Labor Agreement, or the “Agreement,” covering five USW local branches, or approximately 80% of Verso’s hourly represented workforce as of December 31, 2019. The Agreement, which was effective on March 1, 2019, will run for a period of three years with staggered expiration dates at each of the affected sites. In addition, two smaller local unions (the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters) at two of the mill locations also signed and are participating in the Agreement. The remaining four smaller trade unions at two of the mill sites ratified new agreements in the fourth quarter 2019.
Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations

We are subject to a wide range of federal, state, regional and local general and industry-specific environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including without limitation the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or “Clean Water Act,” the federal Clean Air Act, the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or “CERCLA,” the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Emergency Planning & Community Right-To-Know Act, the Oil Pollution Act and similar state and local laws. Our mills in Maine and Maryland also are subject to a regional regime designed to address climate change, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or “RGGI,” which caps the maximum allowable greenhouse gases emitted by sources subject to the RGGI regime. We sold our mill in Maine in February 2020. In addition to our mill operational efforts to comply with the cap, we participate in transactions - for example, auctions and the secondary market for allowances under the RGGI - to help comply with the cap. In the future, we may be subject to additional federal, state, regional, local or supranational legislation related to climate change and greenhouse gas controls. Failure to comply with any of the above-noted climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Among our activities subject to environmental regulation are the emissions of air pollutants, discharges of wastewater and stormwater, operation of dams, storage, handling, treatment and disposal of materials and waste, and remediation of soil, surface water and ground water contamination. Many environmental and health and safety laws and regulations provide for substantial fines or penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions for any failure to comply. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant costs for abatement measures, the interruption of our operations and/or facility shutdowns.
Certain environmental laws, such as CERCLA and similar state laws, provide for strict liability, and under certain circumstances joint and several liability, for investigation and remediation of the release of hazardous substances into the environment, including without limitation soil and groundwater. These laws may apply to properties presently or formerly owned or operated by or presently or formerly under the charge, management or control of an entity or its predecessors, as well as to conditions at properties at which waste attributable to an entity or its predecessors was disposed. Under environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property or a party formerly or previously in charge, management or control of real property and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of at real property, may be held liable for the cost to investigate or clean up that real property and for related damages to natural resources. We handle and dispose of wastes arising from our mill operations, including disposal at on-site landfills. We are required to maintain financial assurance (in the form of letters of credit and other similar instruments) for the expected cost of landfill closure and post-closure care. We could be subject to liability, including liability for investigation and cleanup costs, if contamination is discovered at one of our current or former paper mills or another location where we have disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, wastes. 
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We have made, and will continue to make, significant expenditures to comply with these requirements and our permits. We incurred environmental capital expenditures of $1 million, $2 million and $3 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Permits are required for the operation of our mills and related facilities. Most such permits are subject to periodic renewal, and all are subject to modification and revocation. We and others have the right to challenge our permit conditions through administrative and legal appeals and review processes. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with the permits, and violators are subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, injunctions or both. Other parties also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance with the permits.
We could be subject to potentially significant fines, penalties, criminal sanctions, plant shutdowns, or interruptions in operations for failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permits.
In November 2019, the state of West Virginia asserted that four aboveground storage tanks at Verso’s Luke Mill leaked and that Verso had failed to take certain actions to prevent and report the release of pollutants into the Potomac River. In December 2019, the state of Maryland brought suit against Verso asserting the unlawful discharge of pollutants into the North Branch of the Potomac River from the Luke Mill. Also in November 2019, Verso received formal notice that the Potomac Riverkeeper Network (the “PRN”) intended to bring suit against Verso based on similar assertions. No such suit has been filed against Verso by the PRN as of the date of this Report. Verso closed the Luke Mill, which sits on the border of West Virginia and Maryland, in June 2019. Verso is working cooperatively and transparently with both Maryland and West Virginia regulatory agencies to address the concerns at the Luke Mill. Verso plans to vigorously defend itself in these matters. During 2019, Verso recorded $3 million of expense in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to environmental remediation 
efforts, of which $2 million is included in Accrued and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019 (see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). As additional information becomes available, the Company will re-assess the liabilities related to these matters and revise the estimated accruals, if necessary. The ultimate aggregate amount of probable monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters is subject to many uncertainties and could be material, but management cannot reasonably estimate the total amount or range of potential liability and possible losses at this time.
History
Verso Corporation was incorporated in 2006 in the state of Delaware. We began operations on August 1, 2006, when we acquired the assets and certain liabilities comprising the business of the Coated and Supercalendered Papers Division of International Paper. We were formed for the purpose of consummating the acquisition from International Paper. We completed our initial public offering of common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in May 2008.
On January 26, 2016, Verso and substantially all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, or the “Debtors,” filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. On June 23, 2016, the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming the Debtors’ First Modified Third Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code dated as of June 20, 2016, or the “Plan.” On July 15, 2016, the Plan became effective pursuant to its terms and the Debtors emerged from their Chapter 11 cases, or the “Chapter 11 Cases.”
