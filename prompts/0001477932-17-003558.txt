Item 1: Business
 
Background of the Company
 
MMEX Resources Corporation was formed as a Nevada corporation in 2005. The current management team lead an acquisition of the Company (then named Management Energy, Inc.) through a reverse merger completed on September 23, 2010 and changed the Company’s name to MMEX Mining Corporation on February 11, 2011. We previously unsuccessfully pursued mining and coal projects that have since been abandoned. We have never generated any revenues and have accumulated losses of $36,918,594 as of April 30, 2017.
 
The Company was engaged in the exploration, extraction and distribution of coal from September 23, 2010 until April 12, 2016. As of April 12, 2016, the Company changed its business to the exploration, extraction, refining and distribution of oil, gas, petroleum products and electric power. Effective as of April 6, 2016, the Company changed its name from MMEX Mining Corporation to MMEX Resources Corporation to reflect the change in its business plan. 
 
We are a development stage company engaged in the exploration, extraction, refining and distribution of oil, gas, petroleum products and electric power. We plan to focus on the acquisition, development and financing of oil, gas, refining and electric power projects in Texas, Peru, and other countries in Latin America using the expertise of our principals to identify, finance and acquire these projects. 
 
On March 31, 2017, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 3,000,000,000 to 5,000,000,000 and to provide for two classes of common stock: Class A common stock, having one vote per share, and Class B common stock, having 10 votes per share.

Current Business Operations and Strategy
 
The most significant focus of our current business plan is to build crude oil refining facilities in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We intend to commence operations with a 10,000 bpd Distillation Unit that will produce a non-transportation grade diesel primarily for sale in the local market for drilling frac fluids, along with naptha and heavy fuel oil to be sold to other refiners. We also anticipate constructing a crude oil refinery with up to a 100,000 bpd capacity at the same location in West Texas. 
 
The Company is focusing on the Distillation Unit first in an effort to build and commence operations, and ultimately generate cash flow, on an expedited basis. The permitting process is significantly shorter for construction of the Distillation Unit and is expected to be 45 days while the permitting process for the Large Refinery is expected to be 12-18 months. Additionally, the construction of the Distillation Unit will require significantly less capital than the construction of the Large Refinery. As a result, less capital will be required to build and complete the project and generate revenue and profits. 
 
On March 4, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Maple Resources, a related party, to acquire all of Maple Resources’ right, title and interest in plans to build the Refinery. The Company agreed to acquire such rights in exchange for the issuance of 7,000,000,000 shares of Class B common stock. The shares were to be issued in two tranches, a first tranche of 1,500,000,000 shares issued on March 4, 2017 and a second tranche of 5,500,000,000 shares to be issued after the Company’s articles of incorporation were amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock. Following the issuance of the first tranche of 1,500,000 shares, Maple Resources agreed to forego the issuance of the second tranche of shares. Accordingly, no further shares will be issued to Maple Resources as part of this transaction.
 
These projects will be built on 476.145 acres located 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, near the Sulfur Junction spur of the Texas Pacifico Railroad. If successfully developed, the Refinery would connect to existing railways and pipelines to market diesel, gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas and other refined products within the U.S., with the potential to market these products and crude oil to western Mexico and South America. If completed, the Large Refinery will be one of the first full scale oil refineries built in the United States in more than 40 years. 
 
According to a report the Company received from VFuels Oil & Gas Engineering, the cost of a Distillation Unit with a 10,000 bpd capacity would be approximately $50 million. According to a report the Company received from KP Engineering, the cost of a 50,000 bpd refinery is estimated to be approximately $500 million and the cost of a 100,000 bpd refinery is estimated to be approximately $850 million. These estimates are only preliminary estimates and are subject to substantial change when additional engineering is completed. 
 
Constructing the Refinery will require a significant number of governmental permits and approvals. The principal permit for the construction of the Refinery is the Air Permit issued by the TCEQ and significant construction will not begin until we have received the Air Permit. Trinity Consultants, the Company’s air quality permit advisor, estimates it will take approximately 45 days to obtain the Air Permit for the Distillation Unit once the permit is filed and approximately 18 months to obtain the Air Permit for the Large Refinery. According to VFuels Oil & Gas Engineering, construction for the Distillation Unit would take approximately 15 to 18 months following the receipt of its Air Permit. KP Engineering has estimated that the completion of the Large Refinery would take from 15 to 18 months following the receipt of its Air Permit
 
The cost of construction is very significant and we intend to finance such costs through debt and equity offerings in additional to traditional project financing from banks or other large institutional investors. Such large financial institutions will require engineering, marketing and feasibility studies. In order to attract the significant capital necessary to build the Refinery, the Company will have to fund the cost of these reports and studies, likely out of equity raises. 
 
We plan on marketing and distributing refined products in the Western areas of the United States and Mexico, and we may export product to Latin America. The diesel produced by the Distillation Unit will be marketed and sold locally, primarily for use in drilling frac fluids, and likely transported by truck or by existing railroad systems. Any other refined products produced from the operation of the Distillation Unit (principally ATBs and naptha) would be shipped to other refineries, primarily in the Corpus Christi, Texas area, by pipeline and existing railroad systems for further processing.

The Refinery will be located on the Texas Pacifico Railroad rail route 20 miles Northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, approximately 1.5 miles from the Sulphur Junction on the Texas Pacifico Railroad. Once needed repairs are finished to the tracks and railway, the Texas Pacifico Railroad will connect to the Ferromex RR in Ojinago, Mexico, giving us access to the western Mexico markets. 
 
The Texas Department of Transportation owns the Texas Pacifico Railroad, which runs from the San Angelo Junction, near Coleman, Texas, to the Texas-Mexico border at Presidio. The Texas Pacifico Railroad entails approximately 371 miles of track and interchanges with BNSF Railway and Fort Worth and Western Railroad. The Texas Pacifico Railroad is operated by Texas Pacifico Transportation LTD, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico. Our planned Refinery is located on the Texas Pacifico Railroad rail route approximately 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, approximately 1.5 miles from the Sulphur Junction on the Texas Pacifico Railroad. The Texas Pacifico Railroad will connect to the Ferromex Railroad at Ojinaga, Mexico. 
 
Management Expertise in Oil, Gas, Refining and Electric Power Project Development and Project Finance Development
 
The Board of Directors has decided to focus the Company’s efforts in the oil, gas, refining and electric power business in the U.S. and in Latin America. The principal reasons behind this shift in focus is to capitalize on the experience and expertise of the MMEX management team, its directors and principal stockholders. MMEX management has over 30 years of experience in natural resource project development and project financing in North and South America and the U.K. In addition, MMEX directors and principal stockholders with oil, gas, refining and electric power experience will bring this expertise into the Company.
 
MMEX principals formed Maple Resources Corporation (“Maple Resources”) in 1986 to engage in the evaluation, acquisition and development of oil & gas, refining, power generation, natural gas transmission and processing energy projects in the western United States and Latin America. Maple Resources and its principals have engaged in a number of oil and gas acquisitions and dispositions and ultimately acquired assets that included 10 gas processing plants and approximately 770 miles of natural gas gathering lines and transmission infrastructure. In 1992, Maple Resources sold substantially all of its existing US-based assets and began to pursue energy projects in Latin America, particularly in Peru through its affiliate The Maple Gas Corporation del Peru Ltd (“Maple Peru”). In 1993, Maple Peru began developing the Aguaytía Project, an integrated natural gas and electric power generation and transmission project. This US$ 273 million project involved the first commercial development of a natural gas field in Peru, as well as the construction and operation of approximately 175 miles of hydrocarbon pipelines, a gas processing plant, a fractionation facility, a 153 MW power plant and the related 392 km of electricity transmission lines. The Aguaytía Project began commercial operation in 1998. Maple Peru also acquired a 4,000 bpd refinery in Pucallpa along with 3 producing oil fields.
 
Proposed Organizational Structure
 
The Company expects to operate the Distillation Unit through its subsidiary, Pecos Refining, and to operate the Large Refinery through another subsidiary set up for such purpose. Currently, Pecos Refining is wholly-owned by the Company and the Company serves as its sole manager. However, the construction of the Distillation Unit and the Large Refinery will require substantial equity and debt financing, far beyond the expected resources of the Company, and we anticipate that the Subsidiaries will obtain equity and debt financing to finance the cost of construction. To the extent these Subsidiaries raise money through the issuance of equity securities, our ownership in the Subsidiaries will be diluted and our economic ownership of such entities may be a minority interest. As such, we will be entitled to only a portion of any future distributions made by these Subsidiaries. In addition, while intend to retain managerial control of the Subsidiaries, it is possible that equity investors will require representation on the board of managers in connection with their equity investments.
Location and Logistics
 
The Refinery will be located in the Permian Basin, which holds some of the largest tapped and untapped oil and gas reserves in the world. The Permian Basis is located principally in West Texas. While production in the Permian Basin in the past had been in decline, the development of hydraulic fracturing in shale zones reversed the trend, and the cost of developing oil and gas reserves from shale formations (the driver of recent US increases in production) is lower in the Permian Basin than in other areas of the US. For this reason, the activity in the Permian Basin has recently been expanding and drawing the interest of major oil and gas companies. We believe that the Permian Basin will be the major domestic producing region in the country for decades to come.

The Refinery will be located 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, near the Sulfur Junction spur of the Texas Pacifico Railroad and in the Permian Basin. We have obtained an option to acquire the land necessary to construct the facility. The exercise price of the option is $275,000, and the option term runs until October 1, 2017. The Refinery site is 476.145 acres and the rail line runs through a corner of the property. 
 
There are six refineries in the Permian Basin located at El Paso, Texas; McKee, Texas; Borger, Texas; Big Spring, Texas; and Artesia, New Mexico. The total capacity of these refineries is 640,500 bpd. These refineries are older refineries designed to process historic production from the Permian Basin. As such, these refineries do not take high-API production or discount it significantly, such as the production being produced from the hydraulically-fractured shale zones in which the current increase in production is occurring in the Permian Basin. Moreover, the increasing amount of shale oil production has outpaced these refineries’ ability to process the new crude oil production. For these reasons, much of the new shale production is currently being exported out of the Permian Basin. Significant infrastructure improvements have been developed and announced to move Permian Basin production to the Texas Gulf Coast. According to the EIA, these infrastructure improvements have and will decrease the discount to WTI pricing that has often plagued the sale of Permian Basin shale crude in the recent past. The Company believes that while the construction of crude oil pipelines from the Permian Basin to the significant refining infrastructure in the Texas Gulf Coast might decrease discounts, pipeline companies will charge significant fees to transport the new shale production out of the Permian Basin, resulting, in effect, in a continued discount for such production, compared to the delivered price to the Refinery. 
 
The Refinery will be located near the major producing shale areas of the Permian Basin in Reeves and Pecos counties. The Company has signed a letter of intent with a significant mid-stream crude oil and pipeline company to supply 50,000 bpd of crude oil production to the Refinery. The Company believes that this arrangement can be expanded to 100,000 bpd should the Company choose to build a 100,000 bpd facility. The arrangement is subject to substantial conditions and there is no assurance that the arrangement can be successfully implemented with this particular company. But, the Company believes there are a number of alternative means of delivering the ever-increasing supply of oil shale production from the Permian Basin to the Refinery site, whether by truck, construction of gathering pipelines by another company or by rail. 
 
The Company’s business plan includes the export of gasoline, diesel and other products produced from the Refinery. The export of gasoline and diesel production is particularly attractive because, as noted above, exported gasoline and diesel does not bear any RIN costs, which is a significant cost of domestic refiners. The export of gasoline and diesel will therefore be a significant way to increase profits of the Refinery. 
 
There are opportunities to sell refined products domestically, and there are significant refined product pipelines throughout the Permian Basin. Indeed, for some of the products produced by the Refinery, such as ATBs, the logical market is other domestic refineries that are designed to use these products as feedstock. The Company has had favorable preliminary discussions with product pipeline companies regarding the transport of the refined products from the Refinery, but there are no arrangements or contracts in place. 
 
Transportation
 
We will likely be transporting refined products primarily by rail. Both the U.S. Department of Transportation and its agency, the Federal Railroad Administration, have issued regulations pertaining to the shipment of crude oil and refined products. In addition, TxDOT has its own set of regulations pertaining to these matters, and Mexico will have additional regulations governing the transport of refined products and crude oil. As part of the construction of the Refinery, we will develop procedures and policies in connection with our shipping partners and buyers to comply with all relevant regulations. 
 
We intend to transport the diesel production from our Distillation Unit by truck or by existing railroad systems within the Permian Basin for use in drilling fracking markets. We intend to transport other of our refined products, principally ATBs and naptha, to other refineries, primarily in the Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas areas, by pipeline and existing railroad systems for further processing.

TxDOT owns the Texas Pacifico Railroad, which runs from the San Angelo Junction, near Coleman, Texas, to the Texas-Mexico border at Presidio. The Texas Pacifico Railroad entails approximately 371 miles of track and interchanges with BNSF Railway and Fort Worth and Western Railroad. The Texas Pacifico Railroad is operated by Texas Pacifico Transportation LTD, a subsidiary of Grupo Mexico. Our planned Refinery is located on the Texas Pacifico Railroad rail route approximately 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, approximately 1.5 miles from the Sulphur Junction on the Texas Pacifico Railroad. The Texas Pacifico Railroad will connect to the Ferromex Railroad at Ojinaga, Mexico. 
 
We plan to transport refined product on the Texas Pacifico Railroad and significant investments are required to upgrade the railroad. TxDOT owns the Texas Pacifico Railroad, which runs from the San Angelo Junction, near Coleman, Texas, to the Texas-Mexico border at Presidio. There are two significant infrastructure improvement projects that TxDOT must be complete before we will be able to use the Texas Pacifico Railroad to transport our production to Mexico as we have planned. 
 
The international railroad bridge, located at the southwestern end of the rail line connecting Presidio, TX to Ojinaga, Mexico burned on two separate occasions, February 29, 2008 and March 1, 2009. TxDOT and Texas Pacifico Transportation LTD, the company that operates the Texas Pacifico Railroad, plan to rebuild the bridge allowing access to Mexico and increased business potential. Current estimates place construction cost at approximately $10 million. The bridge is currently in the permitting process. A recent project schedule shows the completion date to be in December 2017. 
 
In addition, the railroad track between Alpine and Presidio may be upgraded as traffic requires through the area. The upgrade capital improvements required on the Texas Pacifico Railroad to transport significant volumes of traffic are estimated by TxDOT to be in the range of $100 million to $150 million. Our business plan to market refined products into Western Mexico and to export refined products to Latin America will depend on the completion of the international bridge at Presidio/Ojinaga and the capital investment on the Texas Pacifico Railroad railroad. There is no assurance that these capital improvements will be made. If these capital improvements are not made, our business prospects and results of operations could be materially negatively impacted.
 
The Company business plan may also include marketing diesel, gasoline and other refined products in the western areas of Mexico and to transport those products along Grupo Mexico’s rail lines to the Mexican port of Topolobampo located on the Gulf of Mexico for export to Latin America. This business plan depends on the completion of the track upgrades and the completion of the bridge at Presidio/Ojinaga. The Company believes that the market exists in Western Mexico and in Latin America for the refined products that it plans to ship, but it has no arrangements in place to market and sell its products in those areas. 
 
Construction of the Refinery
 
The Large Refinery would cover approximately 250 acres of the 476.145 acre property on which the Company holds an option. Before construction on the Refinery can commence, the Company must obtain all required permits. The Distillation Unit would cover approximately 15 acres of the property. Constructing the Refinery will require a significant number of governmental permits and approvals. The principal permit for the construction of the Refinery is the Air Permit issued by the TCEQ and significant construction will not begin until we have received the Air Permit. Trinity Consultants, the Company’s air quality permit advisor, estimates it will take approximately 45 days to obtain the Air Permit for the Distillation Unit once the permit is filed and approximately 18 months to obtain the Air Permit for the Large Refinery. We cannot submit the Air Permit until we have settled on a preliminary configuration for the Distillation Unit with VFuels Oil & Gas Engineering and for the Large Refinery with KP Engineering. According to VFuels Oil & Gas Engineering, construction for the Distillation Unit would take approximately 15 to 18 months following the receipt of its Air Permit. KP Engineering has estimated that the completion of the Large Refinery would take from 15 to 18 months following the receipt of its Air Permit. 
 
The Company has hired VFuels Oil & Gas Engineering to advise it with respect to the construction of the Distillation Unit. Vfuels has prepared a preliminary report regarding the estimated cost and time-line for construction of the Distillation Unit. VFuels has estimated the cost of a 10,000 bpd facility to be approximately $50 million. This estimate is only a preliminary estimate and is subject to substantial change when additional engineering is completed. VFuels has estimated that the completion of the Refinery would take approximately 15 to 18 months following the receipt of the Air Permit.

The Company has hired KP Engineering to advise it with respect to the construction of the Refinery. KP Engineering has prepared a preliminary report regarding the estimated cost and time-line for construction of the Refinery. KP Engineering has estimated the cost of a 50,000 bpd refinery to be approximately $500 million and the cost of a 100,000 bpd refinery to be approximately $850 million. These estimates are only preliminary estimates and are subject to substantial change when additional engineering is completed. KP Engineering has estimated that the completion of the Refinery would take from 15 to 18 months following the receipt of the Air Permit.
 
Building a refinery is a complicated, costly and time-consuming process. The preliminary report from KP Engineering must be followed by other detailed engineering reports. But, these reports are all essential to the financing of the construction and development of the Refinery.
 
Employees
 
As of April 30, 2017, we had no employees and our executive officer and our two directors currently do not receive compensation. We contract for all professional services when needed.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
 
Background on Refining
 
Oil refining is the process of separating hydrocarbon molecules present in crude oil and converting them into marketable, finished petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, lubricants and petrochemicals. Refining is primarily a margin-based business where both the feedstock (primarily crude oil) and refined petroleum products are commodities with fluctuating prices. Refiners create profit by selling refined petroleum products at prices higher than the costs of acquiring crude oil and other feedstocks, and by managing operating costs. It is important for a refinery to maximize the yields of high value finished products and to minimize the costs of feedstock and operating expenses. Access to robust supply and distribution infrastructure such as pipelines or rail infrastructure that can deliver low-cost crude oil and provide for the delivery of refined products is also a key driver of profitability.
 
The United States has historically been the largest consumer of petroleum-based products in the world. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (the “EIA”) 2016 Refinery Capacity Report, there were 139 operating oil refineries in the United States in January 2015, with a total refining capacity of approximately 18.2 million bpd. High capital costs, historical excess capacity and environmental regulatory requirements have limited the construction of new refineries in the United States over the past 35 years and reduced the number of refineries from 254 in 1982 to 139 in 2016. Domestic operating refining capacity has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 0.3% between January 1982 and January 2016, from 16.1 million bpd to 18.2 million bpd, according to the EIA. This net increase in capacity is the result of efficiency measures and expansions at various refineries, partially offset by the closure of more than 115 smaller and less efficient refineries. The Refinery, if built, will be the first fully-new large scale refinery built in the United States in the last 40 years.
 
Ownership of Refineries
 
Refineries are owned by either integrated oil companies or independent entities. Integrated oil companies have upstream operations, which are concerned with the exploration and production of crude oil, combined with downstream businesses such as refining, marketing, logistics and petrochemicals.
 
An independent refiner has no proprietary crude oil production, and it purchases its feedstocks on the open market under term or spot contracts. Refiners distribute their products through bulk, wholesale or retail channels under term and spot contracts. Many refiners, both integrated and independent, distribute part of their refined products through retail outlets.
 
Based on data from EIA, in recent years, many integrated oil companies have sought to lower their exposure to the refining sector. Because of this trend, the refining industry increasingly must rely on its own operations for its profitability. We believe this trend will continue.

Refining Basics
 
Refineries are uniquely designed to process specific types of crude oils into selected products. In general, each of a refinery’s different process units performs one of three functions:

· | separate through distillation the many types of hydrocarbons present in crude oil into a number of different components, ranging from light to heavy;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | catalytically or thermally convert the separated hydrocarbons into more desirable products; and 
· | treat the products by removing unwanted elements and compounds. 

 
Each function in the refining process is designed to maximize the value of the refined petroleum products produced. Below is a general description of refinery process units. Not all refineries possess each of these units.
 
Distillation
 
Typically crude oil is initially processed at a refinery in the atmospheric and vacuum distillation units. Crude oil is separated by boiling point in the distillation units under high heat and low pressure and recovered as hydrocarbon fractions. The lowest boiling fractions, including gasoline and LPG, vaporize and exit the top part of the atmospheric distillation unit. Medium boiling liquids, including jet fuel, kerosene and distillates such as gasoil, heating oil and diesel fuel, are drawn from the middle of the distillation unit. Higher boiling liquids, such as fuel oils and the highest boiling liquids, called residuum, are drawn together from the bottom of the atmospheric distillation unit and separated further in the vacuum distillation unit. Vacuum residues can be used for fuel oil or bitumen production. The various fractions are then pumped to the next appropriate unit in the refinery for further processing into higher value products or are sent to storage tanks for sale to customers.
Conversion
 
The next step in the refining process is to convert the hydrocarbon fractions into distinct products. One of the ways of accomplishing this is through “cracking,” a process that breaks or cracks higher boiling fractions into more valuable products, such as gasoline, distillates and gasoil. The most important conversion units are the hydrocracker, the FCC unit and the coker. Thermal cracking is generally accomplished in the coker. The coker upgrades residuum into naphtha, distillate and gasoil and produces coke as a residual. Catalytic cracking is accomplished in the hydrocracker and/or FCC unit. Hydrocrackers receive feedstocks from cokers, FCCs and crude oil distillation units and convert lower value intermediate products into gasoline, naphtha, kerosene and distillates under very high pressure in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst. The FCC unit converts gasoil and some residual from the crude oil distillation units into LPG, gasoline and distillates by applying heat in the presence of a catalyst. An FCC unit produces a higher percentage of gasoline, whereas a hydrocracker produces a higher percentage of diesel.
 
The reformer converts naphtha, or low-octane gasoline fractions, into higher octane gasoline blendstocks, which are used to increase the overall octane level of the gasoline pool. The alkylation unit reduces the vapor pressure and enhances the octane of gasoline blendstocks produced by the FCC and coker units through the conversion of light olefins to heavier, high-octane paraffins.
 
Removal of Impurities
 
Lastly, the intermediate products from the distillation and conversion processes are treated to remove impurities, such as sulfur, nitrogen and heavy metals and are processed to enhance octane, reduce vapor pressure and to meet other product specifications. Treatment for sulfur, nitrogen and metals is most-commonly accomplished in hydrotreating units by heating the intermediates under high pressure in the presence of hydrogen and catalysts.
Crude Oil Quality
 
The quality of crude oil dictates the level of processing and conversion necessary to achieve the optimal mix of finished products. In seeking to maximize their refining margins, refiners strive to process the optimal mix or slate of crude oils through their refineries, depending on their refinery’s conversion and treating equipment, the desired product output and the relative price of available crude oils. The terms light, medium and heavy when used in reference to crude oils refer to their density and the terms sweet and sour refer to their sulfur content. These terms are often used in conjunction with each other to describe the qualities of crude oil.

9

Industry Terminology
 
Crack Spreads
 
Crack spreads are a proxy for refining margins and refer to the margin that would be derived from the simultaneous purchase of crude oil and the sale of refined petroleum products, in each case at the then-prevailing price. The 2-1-1 crack spread assumes two barrels of crude oil will be converted, or “cracked,” into one barrel of gasoline and one barrel of heating oil or diesel fuel. Average 2-1-1 crack spreads vary from region to region throughout the United States, depending on the supply and demand balances of crude oils and refined products.
 
Actual refinery margins vary from benchmark crack spreads due to the actual crude oils used and products produced, transportation costs, regional differences and the timing of the purchase of the feedstock and sale of light products.
 
Benchmark Crude Oils
 
Crude oil pricing is generally quoted in reference to the classification of the crude oil, which is based on certain physical characteristics, the source of its production and the major trading hub with which it is associated. Relevant classifications of crude oil include:

· | West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”). WTI is a grade of crude oil that is described as light because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulfur content. Cushing, Oklahoma is a major trading hub for WTI and has been the delivery point for crude oil contracts, and therefore the price settlement point, on the NYMEX for over three decades. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Louisiana Light Sweet (“LLS”). LLS is a major benchmark for light, sweet crude oil that is sourced from the Gulf Coast region. It has a slightly higher density and slightly lower sulfur content than WTI. 
· | Brent crude oil (“Brent”). Brent is a major trading classification of light, sweet crude oil comprised of Brent, Forties and Oseberg and Ekofisk, which are types of crude oil blends sourced from the North Sea. The Intercontinental Exchange is a major trading hub for Brent. Petroleum suppliers in Europe, Africa and the Middle East often set prices for Brent crude oil according to its value on the Intercontinental Exchange if it is being sold in the Western Hemisphere.

Light-Heavy Crude Oil Differential
 
The light-heavy crude oil differential is the price differential between heavy (high density), sour (high sulfur) and light (low density), sweet (low sulfur) crude oils.
 
Product Differentials
 
Because refineries produce many other products that are not reflected in crack spreads, product differentials relative to the products reflected in the crack spreads are calculated to analyze a given refinery’s product mix advantage. Refineries that have an economic advantage are those that produce relatively high volumes of premium products, such as premium and reformulated gasoline, low-sulfur diesel fuel and jet fuel and relatively low volumes of lesser valued products, such as LPG, residual fuel oil, petroleum coke and sulfur.
Operating Costs
 
Major operating costs for refineries include employee labor, maintenance and energy. Employee labor and maintenance are relatively fixed costs that generally increase in proportion to inflation. By far, the predominant variable cost is energy such as natural gas, electricity and refinery fuel gas.

10

Refinery Products
 
The main products produced by a refinery are as follows:
 

· | Gasoline. One of the most significant refinery products is motor gasoline. Various gasoline blendstocks, including RBOB ( Reformulated Blendstock for Oxygenate Blending) and CBOB (Conventional Blendstock for Oxygenate Blending), are blended to achieve specifications for premium and regular grades in both summer and winter gasoline formulations. Additives are often used to enhance performance and provide protection against oxidation and rust formation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Middle Distillates. Middle distillates are diesel fuels, heating oil and kerosene. Diesel fuels are used for on-road vehicles, construction equipment, locomotives and stationary and marine engines. Heating oil fuels are used for home heating, oil-fired heating plants and boilers. Kerosene is used for jet fuel, cooking, space heating, lighting and solvents and for blending into diesel fuel. 
· | Residual Fuels. Many marine vessels, power plants, commercial buildings and industrial facilities use residual fuels or combinations of residual and distillate fuels for heating and power generation. Bitumen, a low-value residual product, is used primarily for asphalt coating of roads and roofing materials. 
· | Petrochemical Feedstocks. Many products derived from crude oil refining, such as ethylene, propylene, butylene, isobutylene, tetramer, nonene, toluene, xylene and benzene are primarily intended for use as petrochemical feedstocks in the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, synthetic rubbers and other products. A variety of petrochemical feedstocks are produced for use as solvents, including benzene, toluene and xylene. 
· | Naphtha. Naphtha is a low-octane gasoline product used as a feedstock by the chemicals industry and for catalytic reforming and the production of hydrogen. 
· | Propane. Propane is a natural gas liquid with a variety of commercial, residential and industrial uses primarily as a fuel, and for heating and refrigeration. 
· | Niche Refined Petroleum Products. Various refined petroleum products are produced in relatively small quantities such as lubricant base oils, biofuels and other refined petroleum products. These products are commonly used as blending components for transportation fuels or as lubricants. 

Refinery Complexity
 
Refinery complexity refers to an oil refinery’s ability to process feedstocks, such as heavier and higher sulfur content crude oils, into value-added products. Refinery complexity is commonly measured by the Nelson Complexity Index. The Nelson Complexity Index assigns a complexity factor to each major piece of refinery equipment based on its complexity and cost in comparison to crude oil distillation, which is assigned a complexity factor of 1.0. The complexity of each piece of refinery equipment is then calculated by multiplying its complexity factor by its throughput ratio as a percentage of crude oil distillation capacity. Adding up the complexity values assigned to each piece of equipment, including crude oil distillation, determines a refinery’s complexity on the Nelson Complexity Index. A refinery with a complexity of 10.0 on the Nelson Complexity Index is considered ten times more complex than crude oil distillation for the same amount of throughput. The Nelson Complexity Index for the proposed Refinery is 6.0.

11

Refinery Location
 
The location of an oil refinery has an important impact on its refining margin since the location influences its ability to access feedstocks and distribute its products efficiently. The location also dictates whether the feedstocks and products can be transported via waterborne vessels, pipelines, rail or tank trucks. Refiners seek to maximize their profits by placing their products in the markets where they receive the highest margins. Historically, for example, refiners whose refineries and logistics systems are situated in areas of high petroleum consumption enjoy a competitive advantage over other suppliers in product distribution and in satisfying local demand. The map below shows the five regions in the United States (called Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts or “PADDs”), which have historically experienced varying levels of refining profitability due to regional market conditions.

The Refinery will be located in PADD 3. PADD 3 has a refinery capacity that dwarfs the capacity of any of the other PADD regions. And, the PADD 3 region has produced more refined product than is used in the region due to its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast areas. Accordingly, the PADD 3 region has historically “exported” most of its refined product to the other PADD regions and internationally, whether by pipeline, ship or rail.
 
The table below shows the export and import of gasoline from the PADD 3 region to other PADD regions and internationally.

Current Industry Trends Relevant to Our Business
 
The competitive landscape for U.S. refiners has been transformed by the growth of domestic crude oil. With the advent horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, shale basins in the midcontinent of the U.S. began growing at accelerating rates in 2010 and 2011. This growth quickly overwhelmed a pipeline infrastructure that was ill-equipped to handle the volume of crude oil that needed to move from the interior of the United States to the coasts. As a result, the price of domestic crude oil, as represented by the WTI price marker, discounted relative to foreign crude oil, as represented by the Brent price marker. This discount has provided incentive for midstream logistics companies and refiners to build the infrastructure necessary to access this low-cost crude oil including crude-by-rail infrastructure that has been developed over the past several years. We believe that refiners with access to this lower-cost crude oil have benefitted from more attractive refining margins than those that lacked access. This margin environment has driven increased refinery utilization and increased exports of distillate while displacing significant volumes of imported of gasoline, transforming the United States into a net exporter of transportation fuels.
Growth in Domestic Crude Oil Supply, Particularly in the Permian Basin
 
In recent years the U.S. refining industry has benefitted from growth in U.S. crude oil production, especially production in the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian Basin shale basins. Due to advances in unconventional drilling technology and improved drilling economics, crude oil production in the United States increased from approximately 5.5 million bpd in 2009 to an average of nearly 8.9 million bpd in 2016. The aforementioned shale basins drove substantially all of this growth. The substantial decrease in the price of crude oil that began in early 2015 and persisted to the latter portion of 2016 caused a decrease in drilling and a resulting decrease in total crude oil production from these shale regions. Beginning in late 2016 and to the present, the price of crude oil stabilized at around $50 per barrel, drilling increased and shale production a whole increased, as shown in the following table.

The Refinery will be located in the Permian Basin of Texas. According to the EIA, between January 2016 and March 2017, oil production in the Permian Basin increased in all but three months, even as domestic crude oil prices fell. As production in other regions fell throughout most of 2015 and 2016, the Permian Basin provided a growing share of U.S. crude oil production.
 
With rising oil prices over the past year, the Permian Basin continues to be attractive to drillers, as reflected in rising rig counts. According to the EIA, as of April 21, 2017, the number of rigs in the Permian Basin reached 340, or 40% of the 857 total oil- and natural gas-directed rigs operating in the United States. The Permian Basin rig count reached as high as 568 in late 2014 before falling to a low of 134 in spring 2016 and increasing to 340 in April 2017.
 
Recent geological surveys have further explored the resources contained in the Permian Basin. In November 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey (“USGS”) estimated that technically recoverable tight oil and shale gas resources in the Midland Basin portion of Texas’ Permian Basin (specifically the Wolfcamp shale formation) could exceed 20 billion barrels of oil, 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 1.6 billion barrels of hydrocarbon gas liquids. The technically recoverable resource estimate for tight oil in the Midland Basin portion of the Permian Basin is higher than any previous USGS assessment of tight oil resources in any domestic resource basin.

The production from these US shale basins, including the Permian Basin, is predominantly light, sweet crude oil, with gravity in excess of 35° API. As a result, coincident with the growth in crude oil from these shale basins, U.S. imports of light crude oil began declining in 2010.
Supply and Logistics Constraints Drive Discounts in Domestic Crude Oil Relative to Foreign Crude Oil
 
Historically, the United States has relied heavily on foreign crude oil imports which are received in waterborne vessels at coastal refineries and terminals. Given a concentration of U.S. refining capacity in the Gulf Coast, and significant refined product demand inland from the coast, much of the existing U.S. pipeline infrastructure was configured to move imported crude oil and domestic refined products from the Gulf Coast to other refining and population centers in the U.S. midcontinent and northern-tier states. With the growth of crude oil production in inland areas like the Bakken in North Dakota and both the Eagle Ford and Permian in the interior of Texas, new transportation infrastructure was needed to move crude oil generally in the opposite direction, to the coasts.
 
This mismatch between existing logistics capabilities and the growing need for inland U.S. crude oil producers to transport their crude oil to major refining centers drove a meaningful difference in the price of inland domestic crude oil and coastal crude oil. Inland domestic producers were forced to discount their crude oil in order to clear the market. As a measure of this discount, WTI on average traded at $10.04 per bbl less than Brent for the period from December 2009 to December 2014. This discount provided ample incentive for midstream logistics companies and others to invest in transportation infrastructure. However, the spread between WTI and Brent crude pricing has narrowed considerably, as more infrastructure to support transportation of inland crude oil to the US coasts has been developed.

During the last year, for example, the spread between WTI pricing and Brent pricing has been around $3 per barrel.
 


Access to Domestic Crude Oil Provides Certain Refiners an Input Cost Advantage
 
Given the price differential between domestic and foreign crude oil over the past several years, refiners that have had access to low-cost domestic crude oil have demonstrated consistently higher margins relative to refiners that did not have access. Until the transportation infrastructure described above was built out, refineries in PADD II (Midwest), PADD III (Gulf Coast) and PADD IV (Rocky Mountain) have had access to these cheaper domestic crude oils via pipeline while refineries in PADD I (East Coast) and PADD V (West Coast) had to rely more heavily on waterborne imports or costly deliveries of domestic crude oil from the Gulf Coast via Jones Act compliant coastal barges and vessels.

This advantage is reflected in comparing the 2-1-1 crack spread using WTI crude oil as the input against the same crack spread using Brent crude oil as the input. According to information from the EIA, for the period from 2011 to mid-2013 the 2-1-1 WTI crack spread ranged from approximately $3 per barrel higher than the Brent crack spread to over $20 per barrel higher. From mid-2013 to 2015, the WTI crack spread over the Brent crack spread narrowed, ranging from a high of approximately $11 per barrel to a low of less than $1. After 2014, the WTI crack spread and Brent crack spread narrowed even further, with the Brent crack spread exceeding the WTI crack spread for brief periods. For the first few months of 2017, the WTI crack spread has exceeded the Brent-WTI crack spread by $2 or less per barrel
 
The United States is Becoming a Larger Exporter of Gasoline and Distillate, Including to Mexico
 
Coincident with accelerating crude oil production growth in the U.S. shale basins in 2010 and 2011, U.S. refining capacity utilization has increased significantly, as noted above. This has led to the U.S. becoming a net exporter of gasoline and distillate. One of the strongest export markets for US gasoline is Mexico, the market the Company intends to pursue.
 
The Mexican government is in the process of opening its gasoline and diesel markets to outside competition and replacing government-set prices with market-based prices. Last year, Mexico began allowing entities other than the state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) to import gasoline and diesel and open retail stations. These changes followed previous energy sector reforms that ended Pemex’s upstream monopoly and opened the oil and natural gas sectors to foreign direct investment. According to the EIA, although Mexico is a large crude oil producer, it relies heavily on imports of gasoline from the United States to meet domestic demand. Based on reports from the EIA, the Company expects that these gasoline and diesel market reforms in Mexico will have significant implications for the sale of U.S.-produced gasoline.
 
The switch to market-based pricing in Mexico is being implemented in phases starting with a series of national price adjustments. The transition began at the start of this year. As reported by the EIA, January retail prices have averaged 14% and 20% higher than in December for regular gasoline and premium gasoline, respectively.
 
For the past several years, Pemex total gasoline sales, which can be used as an estimate for consumption, averaged around 800,000 bpd. However, gasoline sales increased 2.5% and averaged nearly 820,000 bpd in 2016 (through November). Mexican consumption of gasoline has been significantly greater than refinery production, with the difference increasing over the past three years.
 


According to the EIA, Mexico’s refineries have historically been running at low utilization rates because they are challenged to produce clean gasoline and distillate fuels from the available marginal barrel of heavy sour crude oil. More recently, outages have hampered Mexico’s six refineries, which had a total output (including non-gasoline products) of 1.1 million bpd through November 2016, down from 1.3 million bpd over the same months in 2015. Mexican refinery output of gasoline fell steeply to 381,000 bpd in 2015 and then fell again to 333,000 bpd in 2016 (through November). Refinery utilization rates in Mexico declined in 2016 from 78% in January to 60% in November, creating a widening gap between domestic supply and demand.

To meet demand, Mexican imports of gasoline have climbed rapidly over the past two years. According to Pemex, Mexico’s motor gasoline imports were 122,000 bpd higher during the first 11 months of 2016 than during the comparable 2014 period. Since 2008, EIA data indicates that Mexico has imported significant quantities of U.S. gasoline. Based on U.S. and Mexican data sets, U.S. gasoline exports accounted for 80% of all Mexican gasoline imports and provided an average of 47% of Mexico’s gasoline consumption during the first 10 months of 2016.
 


According to the EIA and Pemex, the volume of gasoline traded between Mexico and the United States is significant to U.S. refineries. Over the past five years, U.S. exports to Mexico accounted for between 44% (2014) and 54% (first 10 months of 2016) of total U.S. gasoline exports. On a year-over-year basis, U.S. gasoline exports to Mexico increased by 71,000 bpd in 2015, with additional average growth of 75,000 bpd over the first 10 months of 2016, when U.S. exports to Mexico averaged nearly 390,000 bpd.
 
While the effects of the ambitious reforms now underway in Mexico’s energy sector will only be realized over an extended period of time, the Company believes that the market will be very positive relative to the Company plans to market and sell its gasoline and diesel production in Western Mexico.
