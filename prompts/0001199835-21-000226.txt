  Corporate History
  
 Friendable, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), was incorporated in the State of Nevada.
  
 Friendable, Inc. is a mobile-focused technology and marketing company, connecting and engaging users through two distinctly branded applications. The Company initially released its flagship product Friendable, as a social application where users can create one-on-one or group-style meetups. In 2019 the Company has moved the Friendable app closer to a traditional dating application with its focus on building revenue, as well as reintroducing the brand as a non-threatening, all-inclusive place where “Everything starts with Friendship”…meet, chat & date.
  
 On June 28, 2017, the Company formed a wholly owned Nevada subsidiary called Fan Pass, Inc.
  
  Fan Pass is the Company’s most recent or second app/brand which was released in July, 2020. Fan Pass believes in connecting Fans of their favorite celebrity or artist, to an exclusive VIP or Backstage experience, right from their smartphone or other connected devices. Fan Pass allows an artist’s fanbase to experience something they would otherwise never have the opportunity to afford or geographically attend. The Company aims to establish both Friendable and Fan Pass as premier brands and mobile platforms that are dedicated to connecting and engaging users from anywhere around the World.
 
  Presently, until our apps gain greater adoption from paying subscribers through increased awareness, coupled with additional compelling and exclusive digital content to produce higher revenue levels, the Company has largely supported its operations through the sale of its software services, and specifically its app development services, under a contractual relationship since inception with a third party. The Company’s plan, in due course, is to replace revenue from third party app development services with revenue from its own Friendable and Fan Pass apps, which have various revenue streams currently being tested for long term and/or recurring monthly viability.

  Fan Pass is the Company’s most recent or second app/brand, released in July, 2020. Fan Pass believes in connecting Fans of their favorite celebrity or artist, to an exclusive VIP or Backstage experience, right from their smartphone or other connected devices. Fan Pass allows an artist’s fanbase to experience something they would otherwise never have the opportunity to afford or geographically attend. The Company aims to establish both Friendable and Fan Pass as premier brands and mobile platforms that are dedicated to connecting and engaging users from anywhere around the World. More than 2,000 music artists have signed-up to be onboarded on the Fan Pass app, of which more than 350 have content “channels” available and “broadcasting” on the app and available for their fans to enjoy after payment of the $3.99 monthly subscription.

The Company’s plan, in due course, is to replace revenue from third party app development services with revenue from its own Friendable and Fan Pass apps, which have various revenue streams currently being tested for long term and/or recurring monthly viability.
