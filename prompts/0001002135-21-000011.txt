ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Westell Technologies, Inc., (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware in 1980 and is headquartered at 750 North Commons Drive, Aurora, Illinois 60504. The Company is a leading provider of high-performance network infrastructure solutions focused on innovation and differentiation at the edge of communication networks where end users connect. The Company’s portfolio of products and solutions enable service providers and network operators to improve performance and reduce operating expenses. With millions of products successfully deployed worldwide, the Company is a trusted partner for transforming networks into high-quality reliable systems. 
Reverse/Forward Stock Split and Deregistration/Delisting of Class A Common Stock
On September 29, 2020, the Company filed amendments to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-1,000 reverse stock split of the Company’s Class A and Class B Common Stock, followed immediately by a 1,000-for-1 forward stock split (the “Transaction”). The Company's stockholders approved the Transaction at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on September 29, 2020. The effective date of the Transaction was October 1, 2020. As a result of the Transaction, the Company paid $7.2 million to repurchase approximately 4.9 million shares of the Class A Common Stock at a purchase price of $1.48 per share.
In October 2020, the Company filed a Form 25 and Form 15 with the SEC to delist and deregister our Class A Common Stock. As a result, our Class A Common Stock is no longer listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and trading in our Class A Common Stock will only occur in privately negotiated sales and on the OTC Pink Open Market, if one or more brokers continues to choose to make a market for our Class A Common Stock there and complies with applicable regulatory requirements; however, there can be no assurances regarding any such trading.
The Company’s reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), were automatically suspended for the fiscal year that began on April 1, 2021, because the Company had fewer than 300 security holders of record. As a result, this Form 10-K will be the last report filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) unless circumstances change in the future (e.g., an increase in stockholders above the applicable threshold) and reporting obligations are re-activated.

Segment Reporting
The Company has three reportable operating segments: In-Building Wireless (“IBW”), Intelligent Site Management (“ISM”), and Communications Network Solutions (“CNS”). 
IBW Segment 
IBW segment solutions enable cellular and public safety coverage in stadiums, arenas, malls, buildings, and other indoor areas not served well or at all by the existing “macro” outdoor cellular network. For cellular service, solutions include indoor distributed antenna systems (“DAS”), DAS conditioners and digital repeaters. For the public safety market, solutions include Class A repeaters, Class B repeaters, and battery backup units. IBW also offers ancillary products that consist of passive system components and antennas for both the cellular service and public safety markets.
ISM Segment 
ISM segment solutions include a suite of remote units, which provide machine-to-machine (“M2M”) communications that enable operators to remotely monitor, manage, and control physical site infrastructure and support systems. Remote units can be and often are combined with the Company’s Optima management software system. ISM also offers support services (i.e., maintenance agreements) and deployment services (i.e., installation). 
CNS Segment 
CNS segment solutions include a broad range of hardened network infrastructure offerings suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. The offerings consist of integrated cabinets, power distribution products, copper and fiber network connectivity products, fiber access products and T1 network interface units (“NIUs”). 
Industry Trends and Market Solutions
In-Building Wireless (“IBW”)
IBW solutions, including DAS and small cell installations, have increased dramatically in the last decade, driven by the trend where more and more mobile communication use is taking place indoors. Recent studies show that over 80% of all mobile communication now either originates or terminates from within buildings. More people are using mobile devices and data-intensive services in areas such as stadiums, arenas, malls, universities, hospitals, airports, resorts, convention centers, office buildings, and other indoor areas not served well or at all by the existing "macro" outdoor cellular network. As end-user bandwidth demands continue to increase, the greater the demand for reliable networks that can manage the increased coverage and capacity requirements.
In addition to the increased use of mobile devices indoors, demand is also increasing for in-building wireless coverage for the public safety sector. First responders, such as firefighters, police and other law enforcement officers, and emergency medical service (“EMS”) personnel, are also in need of more modern high-bandwidth mobile communication capabilities beyond the traditional two-way land mobile radios (“LMRs”). Local municipalities with jurisdiction to define in-building public safety coverage are increasingly requiring public safety mobile communication coverage in buildings. Additionally, at the federal level, the First Responder Network Authority (“FirstNet”) radio spectrum was awarded to AT&T to build-out the first nationwide broadband public safety network, which can carry, among other things, high-speed data, location information and images. 
Our IBW solutions include:
•Repeaters (Public Safety Market) – These products perform similarly to cellular repeaters and extend public safety radio signals inside buildings where existing radio coverage does not reach. The products are dedicated only to public safety frequency bands and meet the strict National Fire Protection Association (“NFPA”) regulatory requirements. Westell recently launched two new UL2524 compliant public safety products; an Enhanced Class B repeater in July 2020 and ProtectLink Class A/B repeater in April 2021. 
•Battery Backup Units (Public Safety Market) – The NFPA requires up to twenty-four hours of battery backup for public safety equipment, such as repeaters. These units include full battery backup along with remote failure alarms.
•Indoor Digital DAS Systems (Cellular Market) – This full featured DAS system supports fiber, coax or CAT 5/6 transport to the antenna with complementary fiber expansion units and carrier point of interconnect signal conditioning solutions. The system can scale from a handful of remotes to high density venues utilizing optical expansion units from 600 MHz to 3.8GHz supporting indoor and outdoor SISO and MIMO remotes. The system also includes a Network Management System (“NMS”) to configure and manage the system. Remotes are available to accommodate up to 8 concurrent bands including Wi-Fi as well as high power remotes accommodating up to 20 Watts of output power with passively cooling for indoor or outdoor environments.

•Passive RF System Components and Antennas (Cellular and Public Safety Markets) – We offer a variety of passive system components (couplers, duplexers, splitters, filters, and tappers) for use in both cellular and public safety in-building wireless systems. We also offer a broad line of donor and coverage antennas to support in-building wireless communications.
•DAS Conditioners (Cellular Market) – These units attenuate the high-powered radio frequency (“RF”) source from base transceiver system (“BTS”) to lower-powered RF required for the DAS. We offer both passive and active DAS conditioners, both of which can accommodate the majority of North American wireless service providers' frequency bands, with numerous port configuration options. Our active DAS conditioner, the Universal DAS Interface Unit (“UDIT”), is also a remotely manageable, high density, space saving unit with additional advanced features like spectrum analysis and tone generators to help test and analyze RF signal measurement data.
•Repeaters (Cellular Market) – These units provide a means to amplify and appropriately filter the RF signal from a cell site, providing the additional power and improved signal-to-noise performance necessary to optimize wireless service seamlessly throughout a building or structure.
Intelligent Site Management (“ISM”)
Communication service providers and neutral host operators need to maintain healthy site infrastructure and monitor remote unmanned locations at reduced operating expense, including automating/centralizing routine and preventative maintenance, consolidating alarm collection and reporting, and performing remote diagnostics and dispatch. Additionally, it is expected that the growing need for network densification to manage higher capacity and faster speeds at the edge of communication networks will increase the importance of remote monitoring and network operators will continue to deploy greater intelligence to support visibility and control of edge infrastructure.
Our ISM solutions utilize M2M communication, edge processing, cloud software, and intelligent software which enable operators to remotely monitor, manage, and control critical infrastructure and ensure the continued health and success of the network. The four important areas of focus include:
•Power management – AC and DC power availability and consumption monitoring, battery and fuel monitoring, generator management, hybrid power management and control, and rectifier monitoring.
•Communications management – microwave, DAS, and small cell management.
•Environmental management – heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”) monitoring/energy monitoring/control, environmental monitoring, aircraft warning light (“AWL”) management, and streetlamp and small cell pole management.
•Security management – access management, asset tampering reporting, and surveillance management.
Our ISM solution features the Westell Remote and EdgeLink suite of products, along with Enterprise Optima and Cloud-based VantEdge management systems, which offer a complete view and understanding of site assets remotely (i.e., without a site visit).  This functionality can enable the ability to more cost-effectively monitor, troubleshoot, and correct problems with network infrastructure before outages affecting service occur. 
Our solutions can reduce network operating expenses, improve network performance and increase quality, reliability, and availability of customer network assets.
Communication Network Solutions (“CNS”)
Building a communications network that can sustain harsh environmental conditions, while providing the required reliability to keep customers happy, can be a challenge, especially while trying to minimize costs. Whether it is an industrial, utility, transportation, or telecommunications network, the connections between devices must effectively, efficiently, and safely carry and process signals throughout the infrastructure (cables, racks, enclosures, power distribution, etc.) while providing remote management capabilities.
Our CNS segment provides a comprehensive range of solutions to connect outdoor buildings or facilities, including:
•Integrated Cabinets - Includes outdoor cabinets for sheltering and protecting equipment and maintaining proper operating temperature, small enclosures for protecting equipment, and a “one-stop shop” for complete turnkey solutions of customer-specified equipment integrated and installed in the Company’s cabinets.
•Power Distribution Panels - Includes temperature-hardened fuse panels and breaker panels for installation in equipment racks to connect up to bulk power circuits and distribute power to other equipment via individual power feeds.
•Fiber Access Products - A set of fiber access solutions to address the growing customer needs for higher capacity broadband services and future 5G networks at the edge. The fiber access solutions include a suite of specialized modular

cassettes, cassette trays and collapsible reeling systems for deployment in central office, outside plant, and customer premise environments.
•Copper/Fiber Network Connectivity Products - A flexible portfolio of standard relay rack mount panels and wall mount enclosures for Ethernet, fiber, or coax cables to facilitate easy and simple splicing, terminations, or handoffs.
•T1 NIUs - Includes network interface devices with performance monitoring features and protection panels.
The Company is also working with customers on rural broadband deployments. These remote locations require temperature-controlled outdoor cabinets and copper and fiber cable management, and may include remote site monitoring. Westell develops custom weatherproof cabinets for the customer, integrates the components inside the cabinets, and fully tests the assemblies before they ship. 
Customers
The Company's principal customers include communications service providers, systems integrators, neutral host operators, and distributors. Service providers include wireless and wireline carriers, cable or multiple systems operators (MSOs), and Internet service providers (“ISPs”). 
Customers outside North America (U.S. and Canada), which are primarily located in Australia, Latin America (including Mexico), and South Africa, represented an aggregate total of approximately $3.1 million or 10.3% and $2.8 million or 9.5% of the Company’s total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Sales and Customer Support
We sell our products and solutions through our field sales organization, distributors, and partners. Customer contracts are primarily pricing agreements that detail the commercial terms and conditions, which may include technical specifications, for sales of our products and solutions. These agreements typically do not obligate the customer to a specific volume of purchases over time. The agreements may require the Company to accept returns of products within certain time limits, or indemnify customers against certain liabilities arising out of the use of the Company's products and solutions. If these claims or returns are significant, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.
Often, customers require approval of vendor offerings before they deploy products and solutions in their networks. Evaluation can take as little as a few months for products, but often longer for new products, solutions, and technologies. Accordingly, the Company is continually submitting successive generations of its current products and solutions, as well as new offerings, to its customers for approval.
We provide customer support, technical consulting, research assistance and training to some of our customers with respect to the installation, operation, and maintenance of our products.
Most of our products and solutions carry a limited warranty ranging from one to seven years, which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet published specifications, but excludes damages caused by improper use. In the event there are material deficiencies or defects in our design or manufacture, the affected products and solutions could be subject to recall.
Supply Chain
Westell uses a balanced combination of both in-house manufacturing and assembly processes as well as utilizes relationships with our established contract manufacturing partners (CMs), both domestically and internationally. Many of our products, such as power panels, integrated cabinets, remotes, copper/fiber connectivity, fiber access, indoor digital DAS systems and public safety products, undergo subassembly manufacturing as well as final top-level assembly and/or testing at our Aurora, Illinois facility. We continually review our products and in-house process capabilities and, where appropriate, may expand the use with our CM partners. Within the IBW segment, UDIT and cellular repeaters are fully outsourced, including final top-level assembly and testing, at our largest CM located in Tilton, New Hampshire. Within the ISM segment, the remote sub-assemblies are assembled and tested by the CM located in Tilton, New Hampshire, with final assembly completed by the Company in house. In fiscal year 2021, our spending at our largest CM by dollar value was $3.2 million. 
Reliance on third-party CMs involves risks. Standard commercial components available from multiple suppliers are procured by the CMs. In some cases, where there are single-sourced components and technology needed, we have direct supplier relationships and contracts for these items, and we may maintain inventory for these items at the CMs locations. Critical components, technology shortages, or business interruptions at our CMs could cause delays that may result in expediting costs or delayed or lost business. When our CMs encounter sourcing constraints or challenges due to component availability or extended lead-times, Westell offers our product and sourcing expertise to help resolve these issues.

A substantial portion of the Company's shipments in any fiscal period can relate to orders received in that period. Further, a significant percentage of orders may require delivery within forty-eight hours. To meet this demand, we maintain inventory at our own facilities and at the CMs. Because of rapid technological changes, we face recurring risks that our inventory may become obsolete. With the current and ongoing global shortages of many electronic components, as well as high demand for steel and aluminum products, Westell is faced with having to carry additional inventory as well as consider air freight as compared to sea freight from our partners in Asia to supply products in order to meet our customers' demands. The default method of transportation remains sea freight, but situations many arise that require other modes of transportation. Electronic components and raw material shortages may cause price increases. Manufacturing labor is also becoming more difficult to recruit which could lead to increased wages. Due to existing contracts and timing, Westell may not be able to pass along all these cost increases to customers.
In February 2021, a small fire at a subcontractor destroyed inventory that was being used to produce some of Westell’s products. Insurance policies are expected, but not guaranteed, to cover the replacement value of the assets that incurred losses or damages, less a $50,000 deductible. The loss of the inventory caused delays in delivering products and a decision to accelerate engineering efforts to develop a new replacement product. 
Research and Development
We believe our ability to maintain technological capabilities through enhancements of existing offerings and development of new products and solutions that meet market demands and customer needs is a critical component for success. We therefore expect to continue to devote resources to research and development (“R&D”). In fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Company's R&D expenses were approximately $4.0 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower expense structure resulting from the Company's overall cost reduction efforts, including the restructuring in the quarter ended December 31, 2019. 
The Company's R&D personnel are organized by segment, with each business responsible for sustaining technical support of existing products and solutions, conceiving new products in cooperation with other functions within the Company, and adapting standard products or technologies to meet new market demands and customer needs. Additionally, in an effort to remain a highly valued, superior quality, long-term supplier, each segment is charged with reducing product costs for each succeeding generation of products without compromising functionality or serviceability. The teams leverage the Company’s relationships with its CMs and suppliers to achieve these cost reduction objectives.
Our quality systems and product development processes are registered to ISO9001:2008 International Quality System Standard and TL9000, which is the Telecommunication Industry's sector-specific version of the ISO9001:2008. Many current critical processes required for managing the full product life cycle are already in place. Analysis of process and product performance, as well as monitoring of customer satisfaction and perception of products and performance, are routinely reviewed and corrective actions are taken where applicable. We successfully maintain ISO and the TL9000 certifications through annual audits in support of critical customer product offerings.  Product realization is accomplished as required in the ISO 9001:2008 and TL9000 standards. Critical quality assurance processes such as calibration, control of nonconforming material, supplier evaluation and monitoring, and configuration management are all in place and audited routinely to ensure the best product offerings to the customer. We believe product quality and reliability are critical and distinguishing factors in a customer’s product selection process.
The Company’s products are subject to industry-wide standardization organizations, including Telcordia, the National Fire Protection Association, the Internet Engineering Task Force, the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”) in the U.S. and the International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”).
Competition
We operate in an intensely competitive marketplace and have no reason to believe that this competitive environment will ease in the future.  Our customers base their purchasing decisions on multiple factors including features, quality, performance, price, total cost of ownership, reliability, responsiveness, incumbency, financial stability, reputation, and customer service.  While competitors vary by market, some of our primary competitors include ADRF, Amphenol, Asentria, Bird Technologies, C Squared, Charles Industries, Clearfield, Cobham, Comba, CommScope, Corning, DPS Telecom, Emerson, Errigal, Galooli, Honeywell/Fiplex, Inala, Invendis, ISCO, JMA, Kaelus, Microlab, Purcell, RF Industries, SOLiD, Telect, and Trimm.  Some of these competitors compete with us across several of our products and solutions, while many are a competitor to a specific product or solution.
Intellectual Property
The Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to protect trade secrets, obtain or license patents, and operate without infringing on the rights of others. We rely on a combination of technical leadership, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,

nondisclosure agreements, and other intellectual property and protective measures to secure our proprietary know-how. The expiration of any of the patents held by the Company would not have a material impact on the Company. From time to time, the Company expects to seek additional patents related to its R&D activities.
Employees
As of May 1, 2021, the Company had one part-time employee and 95 full-time employees for a total of 96 employees.
Available Information
The SEC maintains an internet site, www.sec.gov, through which you may access the Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy and other information statements, as well as amendments to these reports.
