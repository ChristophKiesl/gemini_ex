Our Company
 PGT Innovations, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “PGTI” or the “Company”) manufactures and supplies premium windows and doors. Its highly-engineered and technically-advanced products can withstand some of the toughest weather conditions on earth and unify indoor/outdoor living spaces. We create value through deep customer relationships, understanding the unstated needs of the markets we serve and a drive to develop category-defining products. We believe we are also the nation’s largest manufacturer of impact-resistant windows and doors, hold the leadership position in our primary markets, and we are part of the S&P SmallCap 400 Index. We manufacture complete lines of high-end, luxury, premium and mass-custom fully customizable aluminum and vinyl windows and doors and porch enclosure products, targeting both the residential repair and remodeling and new construction end markets. We market our impact-resistant products under four recognized brands: PGT® Custom Windows & Doors, CGI® Windows and Doors, WinDoor®, and, following our acquisition of NewSouth Window Solutions on February 1, 2020, the NewSouth brands. We believe all of these brands are positively associated with service, performance, quality, durability and energy efficiency. We also market a line of window and door products designed to unify indoor/outdoor living spaces under the Western Window Systems® brands, which we believe are associated with innovation, quality, durability and energy efficiency in the indoor/outdoor living space markets. Many of these brands have been added to our portfolio through the acquisitions described below.

• | On September 22, 2014, we acquired CGI, an innovator in impact-resistant product craftsmanship, strength and style that is recognized and respected in the architect community.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On February 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of WinDoor, a provider of high-performance, impact-resistant windows and doors to five-star resorts, luxury condominiums, high-rise multi-family buildings, hotels and custom high-end single-family homes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On September 6, 2016, we acquired an established fabricator of impact-resistant storefront window and door products, US Impact Systems, Inc. (“USI”), and announced the formation of CGIC, the brand and company through which we sell the former USI products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On August 13, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Western Window Systems (the “WWS Acquisition”), an award-winning designer and manufacturer of premium contemporary doors and window systems with a focus on unifying indoor/outdoor living spaces. The Western Window Systems Acquisition has increased and diversified our product offerings and enabled us to expand beyond our previous geographically focused portfolio of primarily impact-resistant products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On February 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of NewSouth Window Solutions for $92 million in cash (the “NewSouth Acquisition”), financed by the add-on issuance of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior notes (“Additional Senior Notes”), together with cash in hand. NewSouth is a manufacturer and installer of factory-direct, energy-efficient windows and doors, including both impact-resistant and non-impact residential products. NewSouth has eight retail showrooms in several locations throughout Florida, with an additional showroom in Charleston, South Carolina.

 Our impact-resistant products combine heavy-duty aluminum or vinyl frames with laminated glass to ensure structural integrity, which provides protection from wind-driven projectiles of all sizes and other debris during a storm. Our impact-resistant products substantially reduce the likelihood of penetration by impacting projectiles, protecting people and property, while providing expansive, unblocked exterior views that other forms of protection, such as shutters or wood coverings, do not provide. Our impact-resistant products also offer many other benefits, including: (1) abatement of sound to substantially decrease outside noise, including during hurricanes; (2) protection against the damaging effects of ultra-violet light; (3) reduction of energy loss due to changing external temperatures; and (4) energy efficiency that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs, as evidenced by the energy ratings our products have received. These impact-resistant products satisfy the nation’s most stringent building codes in hurricane-prone coastal states and provide an attractive alternative to shutters and other “active” forms of hurricane protection that require installation and removal before and after each storm. We also manufacture vinyl porch and patio enclosure products that are designed to allow air flow while protecting against inclement weather, making outdoor spaces more inviting.
 The addition of Western Window Systems (“WWS”) to our family of brands expanded our portfolio of offerings and our geographical footprint and added award-winning and innovative products that combine performance and quality with clean, functional designs. Its products are designed for strength, easy integration into a variety of spaces, smooth operation and are tested for durability.
 The acquisition of NewSouth is expected to support our diversification into growing segments in the window and door industry, by enabling us to enter the direct-to-consumer channel, where NewSouth is a market leader in Florida. NewSouth's direct-to-consumer model is supported by its showrooms and in-home sales. With the addition of NewSouth, we expect to continue our strategy to grow in geographic areas outside of our core markets, with showroom openings planned for northern Florida and coastal states in the South.

Our current market share in Florida, and which is the largest impact-resistant window and door market in the U.S., is greater than that of any competitor. We believe our leading market position is derived from our broad and high-quality product offerings, continuous innovation, well-recognized brands, strong customer relationships, technical capabilities, customer care and extensive knowledge of and involvement in developments regarding hurricane-protection building codes and testing protocols.
 With approximately 3,000 employees (as of December 28, 2019) at our various manufacturing facilities located in North Venice, Orlando and Hialeah, Florida, and Phoenix, Arizona, our vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities include in-house glass cutting, tempering, laminating and insulating capabilities, which provide us with a consistent source of specialized glass, shorter lead times, lower costs relative to third-party sourcing and an overall more efficient production process. Additionally, our manufacturing process relies on just-in-time delivery of raw materials and components as well as synchronous flow to promote labor efficiency and throughput, allowing us to more consistently fulfill orders on-time for our valued customers. 
 The geographic regions in which we currently conduct business include the Southeastern U.S., Western U.S., Gulf Coast, Coastal mid-Atlantic, the Caribbean, Central America and Canada. We distribute our products through multiple channels, including approximately 1,700 independently-owned dealers and distributors, national building supply distributors, the in-home sales/custom order divisions of major U.S. home building and improvement supply retailers and, with our acquisition of NewSouth, the direct-to-consumer channel. We believe this broad distribution network provides us with the flexibility to meet demand as it shifts between the repair and remodel and residential new construction end markets.
 History 
 PGT Innovations, Inc. is a Delaware corporation. We were formed on December 16, 2003 as PGT, Inc. and operate our business through our various subsidiaries, PGT Industries, Inc., a Florida corporation, which was founded in 1980 as Vinyl Tech, Inc. On June 27, 2006, we became a publicly listed company on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol “PGTI”. We changed our name to PGT Innovations, Inc. which we announced on December 14, 2016. Effective on December 28, 2016, the listing of the Company’s common stock was transferred to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and our common stock began trading on the NYSE under our existing ticker symbol of “PGTI”.
Industry Segments 
 We operate as two segments based on geography: the Southeast segment, and the Western segment. See Note 20 to the Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information.
Our Products
 PGT Custom Windows & Doors
 PGT’s products carry the PGT/Visibly Better® trade mark, and are designed to be ideal for new construction and replacement projects serving the residential, commercial, high-rise and institutional markets. PGT's product line includes a variety of aluminum and vinyl windows and doors.
 WinGuard. WinGuard is an impact-resistant product line that combines heavy-duty aluminum or vinyl frames with laminated glass to provide protection from hurricane-force winds and wind-borne debris and satisfies increasingly stringent building codes. Our marketing and sales of the WinGuard product line is primarily targeted to hurricane-prone coastal states in the U.S., as well as the Caribbean and Central America. Combining the impact resistance of WinGuard with insulating glass creates energy efficient windows that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs. Our WinGuard Vinyl line of windows and doors is designed to offer some of the highest design pressures available on impact-resistant windows and doors, in a modern profile, with larger sizes that satisfy the most stringent hurricane codes in the country. It protects against flying debris, intruders, outside noise and UV rays.
 EnergyVue. EnergyVue is our non-impact vinyl window featuring energy-efficient insulating glass and multi-chambered frames that meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones to help consumers save on energy costs. Its new design has a refined modern profile and robust construction and is offered in larger sizes and higher design pressures, multiple frame colors, and a variety of hardware finishes, glass tints, grid styles and patterns.
 Aluminum. We offer a complete line of fully customizable, non-impact-resistant aluminum frame windows and doors. These products primarily target regions with warmer climates, where aluminum is often preferred due to its ability to withstand higher structural loads. Adding insulating glass creates energy-efficient windows that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs. 
 Eze-Breeze. Eze-Breeze non-glass vertical and horizontal sliding panels for porch enclosures are vinyl-glazed, aluminum-framed products used for enclosing screened-in porches that provide protection from inclement weather.

CGI
 CGI’s products carry the CGI® brand and carry the trademarked product names of Estate Collection, Sentinel by CGI, Estate Entrances, Commercial Series, Targa by CGI, and Sparta. Also, under CGI, CGIC sells the Company’s commercial storefront system.
 Estate Collection. Our Estate Collection of windows and doors is CGI’s premium aluminum impact-resistant product line. These windows and doors can be found in high-end homes, resorts and hotels, and in schools and office buildings. Our Estate Collection combines protection against hurricane force damage with architectural-grade quality, handcrafted details and modern engineering. These windows and doors protect and insulate against hurricane winds and wind-driven debris, outside noise, and offer UV protection. Estate’s aluminum frames are thicker than many of our competitors’ frames, making it a preferable choice for consumers in coastal areas prone to hurricanes. In January 2019, consistent with management’s plan for this product line, we began the process of making our Estate Collection part of our WinDoor product offerings, which we believe will align the Estate Collection’s status as a high-end, luxury product line, with WinDoor’s focus on the luxury market. We anticipate completion of this repositioning of the Estate Collection to WinDoor in the first half of 2020.
 Sentinel. Sentinel is a complete line of aluminum impact-resistant windows and doors from CGI that provides quality craftsmanship, energy efficiency and durability at a lower price point than our Estate Collection. Sentinel windows and doors are designed and manufactured with the objectives of enhancing home aesthetics, while delivering protection from hurricane winds and wind-borne debris. Sentinel is custom manufactured to exact sizes within our wide range of design parameters, therefore, reducing on-site construction costs. In addition, Sentinel’s frame depth is designed for both new construction and replacement applications, resulting in faster, less intrusive installations.
 Targa. Targa is CGI’s line of vinyl, energy-efficient, impact-resistant windows designed specifically to exceed the Florida impact codes, which are the most stringent impact standards in the U.S. Targa windows are designed with the objective of enhancing the aesthetics of a home, are relatively low maintenance, with long-term durability, and environmental compatibility.
 Sparta. Sparta is CGI’s line of aluminum impact-resistant windows and doors that are offered at relatively lower price points, and that meet Florida’s impact codes.
 Commercial Storefront System. Our Commercial Storefront window system and entry doors are engineered to provide a flexible yet economical solution for a variety of applications. Our system is designed with the goal of providing easy fabrication and assembly, while also reducing installation time and challenges.
 WinDoor
 WinDoor’s products carry the WinDoor® brand and carry various product names, including its 3000 and 4000 Series aluminum windows, its 6000, 7000 and 8000 Series aluminum sliding glass doors, and its 9000 Series thermally broken windows and doors.
 Aluminum Doors and Windows. WinDoor produces a wide array of high-end, luxury aluminum doors and windows, including impact and non-impact sliding glass doors and terrace doors, fixed picture windows, single hung windows, and horizontal rolling windows. All of WinDoor’s aluminum windows are available in impact and non-impact versions and meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones.
 Thermally Broken Doors and Windows. WinDoor produces a variety of aluminum thermally broken doors and windows. WinDoor’s thermally broken products provide the strength of aluminum with the energy ratings usually seen in only vinyl products. All of WinDoor’s thermally broken products are available in multiple shapes and sizes, have earned high performance ratings on impact and non-impact certifications, and meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones.
Western Window Systems
 WWS’s products are non-impact products, and include both customized products for its custom sales channel, and standard products for its volume sales channel, and carry the Western Windows Systems® brand under three product categories of the Classic Line, Performance Line, and the Simulated Steel Line, which is a thermally-broken product
 Classic Line. WWS’s Classic Line is a portfolio of high-quality, disappearing glass walls and windows that combine exceptional performance with clean design. The products of the Classic Line include fixed and operating windows, as well as well as sliding, folding and hinged doors.
 Performance Line. The Performance Line by WWS is a family of moving glass walls and windows engineered to satisfy its customers’ energy and structural requirements, while promoting a contemporary design.
 - 6 -


Simulated Steel Line. The Simulated Steel Line by WWS is a portfolio of thermally-broken, aluminum moving glass walls and windows that look like steel but are far more affordable. This portfolio of products embodies WWS’s nearly 60 years of advancements in door and window design, and we believe exhibits luxury and refinement. The Simulated Steel Line has clean, narrow profiles which gives the glass components of the products a prominent positioning, while maximizing natural light.
 NewSouth
 NewSouth Window Solutions manufactures replacement windows and doors which are made to better enhance the energy efficiency of customers’ homes and combine cutting-edge technologies and a dedication to quality installation.
 Windows and Doors. NewSouth manufactures a wide array of single-hung, double-hung, sliding, picture and visually appealing shaped windows which are durable and energy-efficient. NewSouth also manufactures durable and attractive patio and entry doors which we believe enhance safety and improve the appearance of entry spaces.
 Installation. NewSouth provides quality installation of its windows and doors through an experienced group of installation services companies who are subcontracted to install its products.
 Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales strategy primarily focuses on attracting and retaining distributors and dealers with an expectation of consistently providing exceptional customer service, leading product designs and quality, and competitive pricing all using our advanced knowledge of building code requirements and technical expertise. We also market our products to national and regional homebuilders, who then purchase our products from dealers and distributors. With our acquisition of NewSouth Window Solutions in February 2020, our sales strategy also focuses on direct-to-consumer sales for the types of jobs and customers that our dealers historically have not targeted or serviced.
 Our marketing strategy is designed to reinforce the quality of our products and focuses on both coastal and inland markets. We support our customers through print and web-based advertising, consumer, dealer, and builder promotions, and selling and collateral materials. We also work with our dealers and distributors to educate architects, building officials, consumers and homebuilders on the advantages of using impact-resistant and energy-efficient products. We market our products based on our expectations of quality, building code compliance, outstanding service, shorter lead times, and on-time delivery using our fleet of trucks and trailers. 
 Our Customers 
 We have a highly diversified base of approximately 1,700 window distributors, building supply distributors, window replacement dealers and enclosure contractors. Our largest customer accounts for approximately 4% of net sales and our top ten customers account for approximately 22% of net sales. Our sales are driven by residential new construction and home repair and remodel end markets, which represented approximately 49% and 51% of our sales, respectively, during 2019. This compares to 41% and 59%, respectively, in 2018. The increase in the percentage of our sales made to the residential new construction market in 2019 is driven by the addition of the sales of WWS for the full year of 2019, almost all of which are made into the new construction end market.
 Before the NewSouth Acquisition, we did not supply our products directly to homebuilders but believe demand for our products is also a function of our strong relationships with certain national homebuilders. With the acquisition of NewSouth, we sell direct to the customer.
 Materials, Inventory and Supplier Relationships 
 Our primary manufacturing materials include aluminum and vinyl extrusions, glass, ionoplast, and polyvinyl butyral. Although in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. While most of our materials are typically available from other sources, transitioning to alternative sources would require us to complete testing and certifications related to impact-resistance and for the alternative source of supply to create the customized equipment and tooling necessary to provide the materials and components to us. Therefore, our goal is to develop and maintain lasting relationships with our material suppliers.
 Aluminum and vinyl extrusions accounted for approximately 36% of our material purchases during 2019. Glass, which includes sheet glass and finished glass, which we sourced from two major national suppliers, represented approximately 35% of our material purchases during 2019. Polyvinyl butyral and ionoplast, which are both used as inner layer in laminated glass, accounted for approximately 5% of our material purchases during 2019. The remainder of our material purchases in 2019 are primarily composed of hardware.
 Our inventory consists principally of raw materials purchased for the manufacture of our products and limited finished goods inventory as the majority of our products are custom, made-to-order products. Our inventory levels are more closely aligned with our 
 - 7 -


number of product offerings rather than our level of sales. We have maintained our inventory level to have (i) raw materials required to support new product launches; (ii) a sufficient level of safety stock on certain items to ensure an adequate supply of material in the event of a sudden increase in demand and given our short lead-times; and (iii) adequate lead times for raw materials purchased from overseas suppliers in bulk supply.
 Backlog 
 Our backlog was $67.0 million as of December 28, 2019, and $63.7 million as of December 29, 2018. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers that have not yet shipped, and we expect that a significant portion of our current backlog will be recognized as sales in the first quarter of 2020, due in part to our lead times which typically range from one to five weeks.
Intellectual Property 
 We own and have registered trademarks in the U.S. In addition, we own several patents and patent applications concerning various aspects of window assembly and related processes. We are not aware of any circumstances that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to use our trademarks and patents. If we continue to renew our trademarks when necessary, the trademark protection provided by them is perpetual. 
Manufacturing 
 Our manufacturing facilities are in Florida, where we produce customized impact-resistant and non-impact products, and in Arizona, where we produce customized non-impact products for the custom channel of our WWS brand, and standard products for its volume channel. The manufacturing process for our PGT Custom Windows and Doors products typically begins in our glass plant in North Venice, Florida, where we cut, temper, laminate, and insulate sheet glass to meet specific requirements of our customers’ orders, although our Hialeah (CGI), Orlando (WinDoor), and Tampa (NewSouth), Florida facilities and our Phoenix, Arizona (WWS) facility primarily source their glass needs from external suppliers. 
 Glass is transported to our window and door assembly lines in a make-to-order sequence where it is combined with an aluminum or vinyl frame. These frames are also fabricated to order. We start with a piece of extruded material which is cut and shaped into a frame that fits the customers’ specifications. Once complete, product is immediately staged for delivery and generally shipped on our trucking fleet or with contracted carriers within 48 hours of completion. 
 Competition 
 The window and door industry is highly fragmented, and the competitive landscape is based on geography. The competition falls into the following categories.
 Local and Regional Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of numerous local job shops and small manufacturing facilities that tend to focus on selling products to local or regional dealers and wholesalers. Competitors in this group typically lack marketing support and the service levels and quality controls demanded by larger customers, as well as the ability to offer a full complement of products. 
 National Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors tends to focus on selling branded products nationally to dealers and wholesalers and has multiple locations.
 International Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of non-U.S. companies that have created entities and established manufacturing operations within Florida and have an increasing presence in the South Florida region as suppliers of windows and doors, primarily for high-rise buildings. 
 Active Protection: This group of competitors consists of manufacturers that produce shutters and plywood, both of which are used to actively protect openings. Our impact-resistant windows and doors represent passive protection, meaning, once installed, no activity is required to protect a home from storm related hazards.
 The principal methods of competition in the window and door industry are the development of long-term relationships with window and door dealers and distributors, and the retention of customers by delivering a full range of high-quality products in a timely manner, while offering competitive pricing and flexibility in transaction processing. Trade professionals such as contractors, homebuilders, architects and engineers also engage in direct interaction with manufacturers and look to the manufacturer for training and education related to products and codes. We believe our leading position in the U.S. impact-resistant window and door market, and the award-winning designs and quality of our products, position us well to meet the needs of our customers. 
 Environmental Considerations 
 Although our business and facilities are subject to federal, state, and local environmental regulation, environmental regulation 
 - 8 -


does not have a material impact on our operations, and we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations. 
 Employees 
 As of the end of 2019, we employed approximately 3,000 people, none of whom were represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
