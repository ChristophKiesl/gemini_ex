 Company Overview 
 J.Jill is a nationally recognized womens apparel brand focused on a loyal, engaged and affluent customer in the attractive 40-65 age segment. The J.Jill brand represents an easy, relaxed and inspired style that reflects the confidence and comfort of a woman with a rich, full life. We operate a highly profitable omni-channel platform that is well diversified across our direct (43% of net sales for fiscal year 2016) and retail (57% of net sales for fiscal year 2016) channels. We began as a catalog company and have been a pioneer of the omni-channel model with a compelling presence across stores, website and catalog since 1999. We have developed an industry-leading customer database that allows us to match approximately 97% of transactions to an identifiable customer. We take a data-centric approach, in which we leverage our database and apply our insights to manage our business as well as to acquire and engage customers to drive optimum value and productivity. Our goals are to Create a great brand, to Build a successful business and to Make J.Jill a great place to work. To achieve this, we have aligned our strategy and team around four guiding pillars  Brand, Customer, Product and Channel. 
Brand 
 We have developed a unique brand image that encourages customers to build deep, personal connections with our brand and that differentiates us from our peers. Our brand promise to the J.Jill woman is to delight her with great wear-now product, to inspire her confidence through J.Jills approach to dressing and to provide her with friendly, guiding service wherever and whenever she chooses to shop. We use our key brand attributesNaturally Authentic, Thoughtfully Engaging, Relaxed Femininity, Positive Energy and Confident Simplicityto guide all brand messaging, which is consistently communicated to our customers, whether she chooses to shop on our www.jjill.com website, in our retail stores or through our catalog. 
 We believe we have the ability to create and maintain positive brand associations with customers. We have cultivated a differentiated brand that resonates with our loyal customers, as evidenced by one of the highest levels of brand satisfaction and one of the highest aided brand awareness scores relative to our peers. 
 Customer 
 While we find that women of all ages are attracted to our brand, our typical customer is 40 to 65 years old, is college educated and has an annual household income that exceeds $150,000. She leads a busy, yet balanced life, as she works outside the home, is involved in her community and has a family with children. She values comfort, ease and versatility in her wardrobe, in addition to quality fabrics and thoughtful details. She is fashion conscious and looks to J.Jill to interpret current trends most relevant to her needs and lifestyle. She buys wear-now product and is willing to invest in special, unique pieces. She is tech savvy, but also loves the J.Jill store experience and frequently engages with us across all channels.

As our customers increase their tenure with our brand, they tend to spend more and purchase more frequently. Additionally, as we retain customers over time, they tend to migrate from single channel customers to more valuable omni-channel customers. Omni-channel customers reflect 22% of our active customer base for fiscal year 2016, which has increased from 20% in pro forma fiscal year 2015 and 19% in fiscal year 2014. See Managements Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSupplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Information for discussion regarding our pro forma fiscal year 2015. 
 Product 
 Our Products 
 Our products are marketed under the J.Jill brand name and sold exclusively through our direct and retail channels. Our diverse assortment of apparel spans knit and woven tops, bottoms and dresses as well as sweaters and outerwear. We also offer a range of complementary footwear and accessories, including scarves, jewelry and hosiery. By presenting our merchandise to her in clear product stories, we strive to uncomplicate fashion across her entire wardrobe, providing comfortable, easy and versatile collections that enable her to dress confidently for a broad range of occasions. Our products are available across the full range of sizes including Misses, Petites, Womens and Tall, and reflect a modern balance of style, quality, comfort and ease at accessible price points. The core products of our assortment are designed and merchandised in-house around clear product stories, grounded with essential yet versatile styles and fabrications that are typically represented across a season. Assortments are updated each month with fresh colors, layering options, novelty and fashion. Our foundation is comprised of a full assortment of knits, wovens and sweaters, and provides easy dressing options for everyday wear. In addition to our core assortment, we have developed two sub-brands as extensions of our brand aesthetic and our customer lifestyle needs: 
 Pure Jill: Our Pure Jill sub-brand reflects the art of understated ease. It is designed with a clear focus and minimalist approach to style, and reflected in simple shapes, unstructured silhouettes, interesting textures, soft natural fabrics and artful details. 
 Wearever: Our Wearever sub-brand consists of our refined rayon jersey knit collection that is designed for work, travel and home. It has a foundational collection of versatile shapes and proportions, in solids and prints that mix easily to provide endless optionseverything works together. These soft knits are easy care and wrinkle-free, and always look great. 
 We also offer accessories in unique, versatile and wearable collections. These accessory collections are primarily driven by scarves and jewelry and seamlessly complete our customers wardrobe. 
 Product Design and Development 
 Each year we offer 12 merchandise collections that are introduced every four weeks and designed and delivered to provide a consistent flow of fresh products. All of our merchandise is designed in-house, and we create newness through the use of different fabrics, colors, patterns and silhouettes, with approximately 40% new styles in each monthly collection. We introduce each collection simultaneously on our website, in our retail stores and in our catalogs. We support each collection with continuous web updates, sequenced floor sets and 25 corresponding catalog editions in addition to regular, coordinated marketing activities. Our new product development lifecycle typically takes 48 weeks from design concept through delivery. We leverage feedback and purchasing data from our customer database along with continual collaborative hindsighting to guide our product and merchandising decision making. Joann Fielder, our Executive Vice President and Chief Creative and Merchandising Officer, oversees a team responsible for design, product development, sourcing, creative, merchandising and inventory planning. This close coordination between our creative and merchandising teams ensures that our product and brand message is clearly communicated to our customers across all channels. 
 We believe our merchandising strategy, a flow of fresh, new styles and ability to integrate continuous customer feedback and purchasing data allow us to consistently deliver relevant products to our customers. Our 
 
5 
 
 disciplined planning and product lifecycle management strategies enable effective in-season inventory management to maximize inventory turn and productivity. Through these effective inventory management practices, we are able to minimize markdowns and promotional activity, allowing us to drive favorable gross margins. 
 Channel 
 We are an omni-channel retailer, delivering a seamless brand experience to our customer, wherever and whenever she chooses to shop across our website, retail stores and catalog. Driven by our direct-to-consumer heritage, we have a highly profitable omni-channel platform that is well-diversified across our direct and retail channels. In 1999, we became an omni-channel retailer, with the launch of our website and the opening of our first retail stores. Our channels reinforce one another and drive traffic to each other, and we deliver a consistent brand message by coordinating the release of our monthly collection across our website, retail stores and catalogs, allowing our customers to experience a uniform brand message. We believe that our customers buying decisions are influenced by this consistent messaging and experience across our sales channels. We have a strong track record of migrating customers from a single-channel customer to a more valuable, omni-channel customer over time. 
Direct Channel 
 Our direct channel, which represented 43% of total net sales for fiscal year 2016, consists of our website and catalog orders. 
 Industry-Leading E-commerce Platform 
 Our website, www.jjill.com, is a natural extension of our retail stores and our catalog, and provides customers with a broader range of colors and sizes, including Womens and Tall sizes, than available in our stores. Our website has been optimized for shopping and purchasing across desktop, mobile phone and tablet devices. The website features updates on new collections, guidance on how to wardrobe and wear our products and the ability to chat live with a sales representative, all of which facilitate customer engagement and interaction. Additionally, we leverage our website as an efficient inventory clearance vehicle, which allows us to keep our retail store products fresh and representative of our newest collection. Within our direct channel, E-commerce represented 89% of fiscal 2016 net sales. 
 Catalog 
 Our catalogs are an integral part of our business. As one of our primary marketing vehicles, our catalogs promote and reinforce our brand image and drive customer acquisition and engagement across all of our channels. We produce 25 annual editions of our catalog that, when combined with an increasing investment in online marketing, drives customer acquisition and engagement across all of our channels. As on our website and in our retail stores, our catalogs reflect our product offering in settings that align with our merchandise segments, including our sub-brands, and provide guidance on styling and wardrobing. Our catalogs are designed in-house, providing us with greater creative control as well as effectively managing our catalog production costs. Within our direct channel, catalog orders represented 11% of fiscal year 2016 net sales. 
Retail Channel 
 Our Stores 
 Our retail channel represented 57% of net sales for fiscal year 2016. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 275 stores across 43 states with approximately half located in lifestyle centers and the remaining in premium malls; all of our stores are leased. Our stores range in size from approximately 2,350 to 6,550 square feet, and the average store is approximately 3,750 square feet. 
 
6 
 
We introduced a new store design concept in 2013 that showcases our brand concept and elevates, yet simplifies, the J.Jill shopping experience. The new store concept provides a welcoming, easy-to-shop format that guides her through clearly merchandised product stories. With natural materials in soothing neutral colors, comfortable fabrics and elegant seating areas, the atmosphere is aspirational, yet attainable. When she cannot find an item in-stock at her local store, our concierge service leverages our in-store ordering platform and ships products to her home with no shipping charge. 
 Site Selection 
 We believe our store expansion model supports our ability to grow our store footprint in both new and existing markets across the United States with the potential to simultaneously enhance our direct channel sales by migrating single-channel customers to omni-channel customers. New store locations are evaluated on various factors, including customer demographics within a market, concentration of existing customers, location of existing stores, and center tenant quality and mix. We also leverage our customer database, including purchasing history and customer demographics, to determine geographic locations that may benefit from a retail store. We target opening new stores in high traffic locations with desirable demographic characteristics and favorable lease economics. We believe we can add up to 100 stores to our store base of 275 over the long term. We plan to open 10-15 new stores in fiscal year 2017 and in each year thereafter. We also plan to selectively close underperforming stores on an annual basis. 
 The following table shows new store openings since the beginning of fiscal year 2012. The stores opened in the last three years were primarily in lifestyle centers.

Competitive Strengths 
 We attribute our success to the following competitive strengths: 
 Distinct, Well-Recognized Brand. The J.Jill brand represents an easy, relaxed and inspired style that reflects the confidence and comfort of a woman with a rich, full life. We have cultivated a differentiated brand and through our commitment to our customer and our brand building activities, we have created significant brand trust and an emotional connection with our customers. 
 Industry-Leading Omni-Channel Business. We have developed a powerful, omni-channel business model comprised of our industry-leading direct channel and our retail stores. Our direct and retail channels complement and drive traffic to one another, and we leverage our targeted marketing initiatives to acquire new customers across all channels. We have a strong track record of migrating customers from a single-channel customer to a more valuable, omni-channel customer over time. As a result, our direct penetration has grown rapidly and accounted for 43% of net sales for fiscal year 2016 driven primarily by growth in our E-commerce business. We believe our strong omni-channel capabilities enable us to deliver a seamless brand experience to our customer, wherever and whenever she chooses to shop. 
 Data-Centric Approach That Drives Consistent Profitability and Mitigates Risk. We believe we have strong customer and transaction data capabilities, but it is our use of the data that distinguishes us from our competitors. We have developed industry-leading data capture capabilities that allow us to match approximately 
 
7 
 
 97% of transactions to an identifiable customer, which we believe is significantly ahead of the industry standard. We maintain an extensive customer database that tracks customer details from personal identifiers and demographic overlay (e.g., name, address, age, household income and occupation) as well as contact history (e.g., catalog and email). We also have significant visibility into our customers transaction behavior (e.g., orders, returns, order value), including purchases made across our channels. As such, we can identify a single-channel customer who purchases a product through our website, our retail store or our catalog, as well as an omni-channel customer who purchases in more than one channel. We continually leverage this database and apply our insights to operate our business as well as to acquire new customers and then create, build and maintain a relationship with each customer to drive optimum value. As of the end of fiscal year 2016, our database had over ten million names. We believe our data-centric approach allows us to respond to customer preferences and mitigate risk leading to consistent, predictable operating and financial performance over time. 
 Affluent and Loyal Customer Base. We target an attractive demographic of affluent women in the 40-65 age range, a segment of the population that is experiencing outsized population growth between 2010 and 2020 in the United States, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. With an average annual household income that exceeds $150,000, our customer has significant spending power. Our private label credit card program also drives customer loyalty and encourages spending. We believe we will continue to develop long-term customer relationships that will drive profitable sales growth. 
 Customer-Focused Product Assortment. Our customers strongly associate our product with a modern balance of style, quality, comfort and ease suitable for a broad range of occasions at accessible price points. Our customer-focused assortment spans a full range of sizes and is designed to provide easy wardrobing that is relevant to her lifestyle. Each year we offer 12 merchandise collections that are introduced approximately every four weeks and designed and delivered to provide a consistent flow of fresh products. We create product newness through the use of different fabrics, colors, patterns and silhouettes, with approximately 40% new styles delivered in each monthly collection, which motivates our customer to visit our stores and/or our website more frequently. We have an in-house, customer centric product design and development process that leverages our extensive database of customer feedback and allows us to identify and incorporate changes in our customers preferences, mitigating fashion risk. We believe our customer focused approach to product development and continual delivery of fresh, high quality products drives traffic, frequency and conversion. 
 Highly Experienced Leadership Team, Delivering Superior Results. Our leadership team is led by President and Chief Executive Officer, Paula Bennett, who joined J.Jill in 2008 and has over 35 years of experience. Ms. Bennett understands the importance of a strong brand, possesses deep knowledge of our customers and has extensive direct to consumer and retail channel experience. She has built a team from leading global organizations with an average of 25 years of industry experience and significant expertise in merchandising, marketing, retail, E-commerce, human resources and finance. We have developed a strong and collaborative culture aligned around our goals to Create a great brand, to Build a successful business and to Make J.Jill a great place to work. Our leadership team is aligned and incentivized around growing Adjusted EBITDA and has delivered superior and consistent operating results, growing net sales by a 10% CAGR, Adjusted EBITDA by a 25% CAGR and Adjusted EBITDA margin by 640 basis points from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016. 
Growth Strategy 
 Key drivers of our growth strategy include: 
 Grow Size and Value of Our Customer Base. We have a significant opportunity to continue to attract new customers to our brand and to grow the size and value of our active customer base across all channels. Historically, we grew our business by driving spend per customer. We strategically increased our marketing investment to drive growth through the acquisition of new customers, reactivation of lapsed customers and the retention of existing customers. This investment has proven effective as, for example, in fiscal year 2016 we 
 
8 
 
 increased our active customer base growth of 11% and new customer growth of 13%. We recently began a brand voice and customer segmentation initiative which, upon completion, will further enhance our ability to target the highest value customers and increase customer spending. Through these initiatives, we believe we will continue to attract new customers to our brand, migrate from single-channel to more profitable omni-channel customers and increase overall customer retention and spend. 
 Increase Direct Sales. Given our strong foundation that positions us to capitalize on the growth of online and mobile shopping, we believe we have the opportunity to grow our direct sales from 43% of our net sales to approximately 50% over the next few years. According to Euromonitor, online apparel sales are expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 15% from 2015 to 2020, which is significantly above the long-term growth of the broader apparel industry. We are undertaking several initiatives to enhance our capabilities and drive additional direct sales. We are in the process of converting our website to a new platform to improve our customers personalized shopping experience and increase the ease of navigation, checkout and overall engagement. Our new platform, managed by our experienced team will provide us with the opportunity to expand internationally. In addition, our mobile platform provides us with the ability to effectively engage with our customer on her mobile device by providing her with access to product research and the ability to connect with the brand socially. We believe our powerful direct platform will enable us to further strengthen our dominant market position and broaden our customer reach. 
 Profitably Expand Our Store Base. Based on our proven new store economics, we believe that we have the potential to grow our store base by up to 100 stores over the long term from our total of 275 stores as of January 28, 2017. We will target new locations in lifestyle centers and premium malls, and we plan to open 10-15 new stores in fiscal year 2017 and in each year thereafter. We introduced a new store design concept in 2013 that showcases our brand concept and elevates, yet simplifies the J.Jill shopping experience. The new store concept provides a welcoming, easy-to-shop format that guides her through clearly merchandised product stories. All of our new stores will reflect our new design concept and we intend to continue this design for new stores and refresh our existing stores as appropriate. We also plan to selectively close underperforming stores on an annual basis. 
 Strengthen Omni-Channel Capabilities. We are pursuing a variety of initiatives designed to enhance our omni-channel capabilities focused on best serving our customer, wherever and whenever she chooses to shop. In fiscal year 2016, we enhanced our management team to focus on the omni-channel customer experience, including the recent hires of a Chief Information Officer and a Senior Vice President of Marketing. We will continue to leverage our insight into customer attributes and behavior, which will guide strategic investments in our business. For example, we will enhance our ability to seamlessly manage our inventory across all of our channels. We also plan to implement technology to further fulfill customer demand, including ship from store to customer and order online for pickup in store. We expect our sustainable model, combined with our omni-channel initiatives, will continue to drive traffic, increase average transaction value and enhance conversion across all of our channels. 
 Enhance Product Assortment. We believe there is an opportunity to grow our business by selectively broadening and enhancing our assortment in certain product categories, including our Pure Jill and Wearever sub-brands, our Womens and Petites businesses, and accessories. Based on strong demand for our extended size product and our sub-brands, we believe we have the opportunity to expand and focus these categories in selected stores as well as test the offering in stand-alone store formats. We also believe we have the opportunity to continue to optimize our assortment architecture and productivity by delivering the right mix and flow of fashion and basics to our channels. In addition, we will continue delivering high quality customer-focused product assortments across each of our channels, while strengthening visual merchandising. Through our focused and enhanced product offering, particularly in our sub-brands and extended sizes, we believe we will continue to drive profitable sales growth over time.

Market 
 J.Jill operates as a specialty retailer in the large and growing womens apparel industry. According to Euromonitor, total apparel sales in the United States grew from $301 billion in 2010 to $343 billion in 2015, reflecting a CAGR of 3%. Within apparel, E-commerce sales grew at a 15% CAGR from $23 billion to $46 billion, while brick-and-mortar sales remained relatively flat. As we continue to grow our business and expand beyond the United States, global apparel sales are expected to grow at a CAGR of 4%. Online sales are expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 15%, which is significantly above the long-term growth of the broader apparel industry. Given our strong foundation that positions us to capitalize on the growth of online and mobile shopping, we believe we have the opportunity to grow our direct sales from 43% of our net sales to approximately 50% over the next few years. Within the womens apparel market, we believe we have an opportunity to gain share within the Sportswear market for women over the age of 40, which has a market size of approximately $42 billion for the twelve month period ended May 2015, according to data from the NPD Group, Inc., and consists of 79 million women, according to a U.S. Census Bureau projection. 
Marketing and Advertising 
 We leverage a variety of marketing and advertising vehicles to increase brand awareness, acquire new customers, drive customer traffic across our channels, and strengthen and reinforce our brand image. These include our 25 annual catalog editions, promotional mailings, email communications, digital and print advertisements and public relations initiatives. We leverage our customer database to strategically optimize the value of our marketing investments across customer segments and channels. This enables us to productively acquire new customers, effectively market to existing customers, increase customer retention levels and reactivate lapsed customers. 
 Our catalog, combined with an increased investment in online marketing, drive customer acquisition and engagement across all of our channels. We reinforce a consistent brand message by coordinating the release of our monthly collection across our website, retail stores and catalogs, allowing our customers to experience a uniform brand message wherever and whenever she chooses to shop. We also engage in a wide range of other marketing and advertising strategies to promote our brand, including media coverage in specialty publications and magazines. 
 In late 2014, we strategically increased our marketing investment to drive growth through the acquisition of new customers, reactivation of lapsed customers and the retention of existing customers. This investment has proven effective as, for example, in fiscal year 2016 we increased our active customer base growth of 11% and new customer growth of 13%. We recently began a brand voice and customer segmentation initiative which, upon completion, will further enhance our ability to target the highest value customers and increase customer spending. Through these initiatives, we believe we will continue to attract new customers to our brand, migrate from single-channel to more profitable omni-channel customers and increase overall customer retention and spend. 
 We offer a private label credit card program through an agreement with Comenity Capital Bank (ADS), under which they own the credit card receivables. We recently renewed our agreement with ADS with more favorable terms to us. All credit card holders receive invitations to exclusive customer events and promotions including special purchase events three times per year, a special offer for her birthday, and a 5% discount when purchases are made on the card. We promote the benefits of the credit card throughout our website, our retail stores and our catalog through banner ads, signage and customer service and selling associate representatives. Additionally, we leverage regional print advertising to promote the card and its benefits to new and existing customers. We believe that our credit card program encourages customer loyalty, repeat visits and additional spending. In fiscal year 2016, 53% of our gross sales were generated by our credit card holders.

Sourcing and Supply Strategy 
 We outsource the manufacturing of our products, which eliminates the need to own or operate manufacturing facilities. In order to efficiently source our products, we work primarily with agents who represent suppliers and factories. In fiscal year 2016 approximately 83% of our products were sourced through agents and 17% were sourced directly from suppliers and factories. We currently work with three primary agents that help us identify quality suppliers and coordinate our manufacturing requirements. Additionally, the agents manage the development of samples of merchandise produced in the factories, inspect finished merchandise, ensure the timely delivery of goods and carry out other administrative and oversight functions on our behalf. We source the remainder of our products by interacting directly with suppliers and factories both domestically and abroad. 
 Agents work with 30 suppliers on our behalf and we work directly with five suppliers. We source our merchandise globally from eight countries including China, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam. No single supplier accounts for more than 20% of merchandise purchased. 
 We have no long-term merchandise supply contracts as we typically transact business on an order-by-order basis to maintain flexibility. We believe our strong relationships with suppliers have provided us with the ability to negotiate favorable pricing terms, further improving our overall cost structure and profitability. Our dedicated sourcing team actively negotiates and manages product costs to deliver initial mark-up objectives. The team further focuses on quality control to ensure that merchandise meets required technical specifications and inspects the merchandise to ensure it meets our strict standards, including regular in-line inspections while goods are in production. Upon receipt, merchandise is further inspected on a test basis for consistency in cut, size and color, as well as for conformity with specifications and overall quality of manufacturing. Our sourcing team ensures that the customer has a consistent product and satisfying brand experience regardless of product size, color or collection. 
 Omni-Channel Distribution and Customer Contact Center 
 We lease our 520,000 square foot state-of-the-art distribution and customer contact center in Tilton, New Hampshire. The facility manages the receipt, storage, sorting, packing and distribution of merchandise for our direct and retail channels. Retail stores are replenished at least once a week from this facility and shipped by third-party delivery services, providing our retail stores with a steady flow of new inventory that helps to maintain product freshness. Our distribution system is designed to operate in a highly-efficient and cost-effective manner, including our ability to profitably support individual direct orders which we believe differentiates ourselves from our competitors. In fiscal year 2016, the distribution center handled 33.5 million units, split between 17.0 million retail (51%) and 16.5 million direct (49%) pieces, and we believe this facility is sufficient to support our future growth. 
 The customer contact center is an extension of our brand, providing a consistent customer experience at every stage of a purchase across all of our channels. In fiscal year 2016, we managed approximately 4.0 million customer interactions through our in-house customer contact center in Tilton, New Hampshire. Our customer contact center is responsible for nearly all live customer interactions, other than in retail stores, including order taking and further serves as an important feedback loop in gathering customer responses to our brand, product and service. We continue to refine and improve our contact center strategy and experience to support the constantly evolving digital landscape. 
 Information Systems 
 We use information systems to support business intelligence and processes across our sales channels. We continue to invest in information systems and technology to enhance the customer experience, drive sales and create operating efficiencies. We utilize third-party providers for customer database and customer campaign management, ensuring efficient maintenance of information in a secure, backed-up environment. We also utilize 
 
11 
 
 a proprietary E-commerce platform hosted by a third-party provider and a well-developed proprietary data warehouse for business intelligence. 
 In fiscal year 2016, we implemented a new core merchandising system in support of a single view of inventory across all channels, increased efficiency in sales support areas and superior product management and reporting tools. This system is foundational to our plans to create a more scalable and seamless omni-channel platform and enhances our capabilities in merchandising and inventory management. We also intend to replace our E-commerce platform in 2017 to drive future growth and further enable digital capabilities. 
 We also invested in a new central processor and upgraded infrastructure and communication networks to increase system processing speed and uptime, improve security, and increase system back-up and recovery capabilities. We also made strategic investments, including a significant upgrade to our retail inventory allocation system and the implementation of a new, scalable design and sourcing system (PLM) that enables significant benefits by enhancing collaboration and sharing in the creative process, increasing automation and adding analysis tools. 
 Seasonality 
 While the retail business is generally seasonal in nature, we have historically not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in our sales. Our merchandise offering drives consistent sales across seasons with no quarter contributing more than 27% of total annual net sales in fiscal year 2016. 
Competition 
 The womens apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national and international retail chains and department stores, specialty and discount stores, catalogs and internet businesses offering similar categories of merchandise. We compete primarily on the basis of design, service, quality and value. We believe our distinct combination of design, service, quality and value allows us to compete effectively and we believe we differentiate ourselves from competitors based on the strength of our brand, our industry-leading omni-channel platform, our strong data capabilities, our loyal customer base, our customer-focused product assortment and our highly experienced leadership team. Our competitors range from smaller, growing companies to considerably larger companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources. 
Employees 
 As of January 28, 2017, we employed 1,406 full-time and 2,395 part-time employees. Of these employees, 342 are employed in our headquarters in Quincy, Massachusetts, 3,009 are employed in our retail stores and 450 work in our distribution and customer contact center and administrative office in Tilton, New Hampshire. The number of employees, particularly part-time employees, fluctuates depending upon seasonal needs. 
 Our employees are not represented by a labor union and are not party to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.

 Our trademarks are important to our marketing efforts. We own or have the rights to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names that are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other foreign trademark registration offices or exist under common law in the United States and other jurisdictions.
