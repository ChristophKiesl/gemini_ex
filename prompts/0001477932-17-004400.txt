ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS
 
Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapies with dermatology, oncology, anti-inflammatory and antibiotic applications. The Company owns the rights to numerous drug compounds, including Prurisol (KM-133), which is in development for psoriasis; Brilacidin, our lead drug in a new class of compounds called defensin-mimetics; and Kevetrin (thioureidobutyronitrile), our lead anti-cancer compound.
 
Effective June 5, 2017, the Company changed its name from Cellceutix Corporation to Innovation Pharmaceuticals Inc.

*ABSSSI- Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infection

 
The Company devotes most of its efforts and resources on its compounds in clinical trials: Prurisol for the treatment of psoriasis, Kevetrin for the treatment of ovarian cancer, and Brilacidin for treatments of skin infections, ulcerative proctitis (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) and prevention of oral mucositis complicating chemoradiation treatment for cancer. We anticipate using our expertise to manage and perform what we believe are the most critical aspects of the product development process which include: (i) design and oversight of clinical trials; (ii) development and execution of strategies for the protection and maintenance of intellectual property rights; and (iii) interactions with regulatory authorities domestically and internationally. We expect to concentrate on product development and engage in a limited way in product discovery, avoiding the significant investment of time and financial resources that is generally required for a promising compound to be identified and brought into clinical trials.
 
Research and development efforts are concentrated on Prurisol, Brilacidin, and Kevetrin:
 


· | Prurisol — Our lead anti-psoriasis drug candidate, is a small molecule compound acting on the principles of immune modulation and PRINS (Psoriasis susceptibility-related RNA Gene Induced by Stress) reduction that has been found to be effective against psoriasis in animal models, both in induced psoriasis as well as a xenograft model with human psoriatic tissue. It is currently in the Phase 2 clinical development study below:

· | Brilacidin — This lead drug candidate is in a new immunomodulatory class with anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties called defensin-mimetics. Modeled after Host Defense Proteins (HDPs), the “front-line” of defense in the immune system, it is a small, non-peptidic, synthetic molecule that kills pathogens swiftly and thoroughly. Just as importantly, Brilacidin also functions in a robust immunomodulatory capacity, lessening inflammation and promoting healing. In June 2017, the Company completed an open-label Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial of Brilacidin for the treatment by daily enema of ulcerative proctitis (UP)/ ulcerative proctosigmoiditis (UPS), two types of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). Study results showed significant patient benefit and low systemic absorption. The Company is also studying Brilacidin’s effect on Oral Mucositis (under Fast Track designation) and, in August 2017, announced it had completed recruitment of subjects to the Phase 2 study below:

 | Active Clinical Trials: Phase 2, Multi-center, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Brilacidin Oral Rinse Administered Daily for 7 Weeks in Attenuating Oral Mucositis in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer Receiving Concurrent Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy 
· | Kevetrin — Our lead anti-cancer compound, is a small molecule compound that modulates p53, a protein involved in controlling cell mutations. In the majority of all cancers, regardless of origin, the p53 pathway is mutated, compromising its anti-tumor functions. In particular, most epithelial ovarian cancer patients have high-grade serous cancer, characterized by near universal p53 gene abnormalities. Pre-clinical research has demonstrated Kevetrin’s unique mechanism of action to induce apoptosis, slow tumor progression and reduce tumor volume in many types of cancers, including lung, breast, colon, prostate, squamous cell carcinoma and a leukemia tumor model. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has awarded Orphan Drug designations for Kevetrin for ovarian cancer, retinoblastoma and pancreatic cancer as well as Rare Pediatric Disease designation for Retinoblastoma. It is currently in Phase 2 clinical development study below:

We are a clinical stage company. We have no product sales to date and we will not receive any product revenue until we receive approval from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory agencies to begin marketing a pharmaceutical product. Developing pharmaceutical products, however, is a lengthy and very expensive process. Assuming we do not encounter any unforeseen safety or efficacy issues during the course of developing our product candidates, we do not expect to complete the development of a product candidate for several years, if ever.
 
The Company’s common stock traded under the stock symbol “CTIX” on the OTCQB until the market close of June 8, 2017. As of June 9, 2017, trading on the OTCQB began under the new Innovation Pharmaceuticals name and ticker symbol “IPIX”.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We are in the business of developing and/or acquiring innovative small molecule therapies to treat diseases with significant medical need. Our strategy is to use our business and scientific expertise to maximize the value of our diverse pipeline. We expect to develop the highest quality data and broadest intellectual property to support our compounds. 
 
We currently own all development and marketing rights to our investigational products. In order to successfully develop and market our products, we may have to partner with other companies. Prospective partners may require that we grant them significant development and/or commercialization rights in return for agreeing to share the risk of development and/or commercialization.
 
The work plan we have developed for the next twelve (12) months is expected to support our clinical trials. If we find that we have underestimated the time duration or cost of our studies or if we have to undertake additional studies, due to various reasons within or outside of our control, our development timelines and/or our financing needs may be significantly impacted. 
 
As a mid-stage developmental pharmaceutical company, the Company has no customers, commercial products or revenues to date, and may never achieve revenues or profitable operations.

Pipeline Summary
 
Compound: Prurisol (KM-133)
 
Disease: Psoriasis
 
Prurisol is our anti-psoriasis drug candidate. It is a small molecule compound with a molecular weight of less than 500. It is synthesized through a multi-step process using commercially available starting materials. Prurisol acts through immune modulation and PRINS reduction.
 
We are developing Prurisol under FDA guidance that a 505(b)(2) drug approval pathway is an acceptable pathway for its development, which will permit us to support the new drug application (NDA) with included data not developed by or for the Company. This offers the benefits of a faster development process. Prurisol is eligible because it is metabolized to abacavir, which is the active moiety in the marketed drug Ziagen (abacavir sulfate). Given that psoriasis is a chronic condition with limited effective therapies that the National Psoriasis Foundation lists as affecting 125 million people worldwide, we see a tremendous market opportunity for an effective new oral treatment. 
 
In August 2015, we commenced a Phase 2a trial of oral Prurisol for the treatment of mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis; on May 24, 2016, the Company released top line data. The trial enrolled 115 patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, graded at a score of 2 (“mild”) or 3 (“moderate”) on the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) scale. The trial was structured with four arms, three receiving different dosing regimens of oral Prurisol (50mg, 100mg, 200mg per day) and one placebo arm for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was a 2-point reduction in the IGA score at Day 84.
 
The trial achieved its primary endpoint in patients treated with 200mg of oral Prurisol. Among the most severe psoriasis patients participating in the study, those having a baseline IGA score of 3 (“moderate”), the primary endpoint was met in 46% of patients who received Prurisol 200mg as compared to 35% in the overall combined mild to moderate group. These data were derived from analyses of all patients randomized across all 9 participating study sites. Additional preliminary data analyses of secondary endpoints showed patients who received any dose of Prurisol, regardless of the treatment arm, had a 1-point improvement (using the IGA scoring system) at a higher rate than that of patients in the placebo arm. This was another indication of the drug’s efficacy. Increases in Prurisol’s therapeutic response, upon evaluating patients at Day 56 (Week 8) and Day 84 (Week 12) of treatment, also were apparent in the Prurisol 200mg arm, suggesting an improving response over time. 
 
In light of Prurisol’s favorable responses and greater efficacy in treating moderate psoriasis, the Company engaged in a Phase 2b trial in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. This study includes active treatment arms of 300mg and 400mg Prurisol per day and placebo and is anticipated to complete later this year. 
 
Compound: Brilacidin
 
Brilacidin is in a new class of drugs modeled after defensin-peptides, which represent a front-line of defense in the human immune system. It is a fully synthetic non-peptide small molecule that has anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Over this past year, the Company has generated anchoring clinical data that are very encouraging regarding use of Brilacidin as an anti-inflammatory/ immunomodulatory agent for localized treatment of relevant diseases.

6

Disease: Oral Mucositis (OM)
 
In animal models of oral mucositis induced by chemoradiation, topically applied Brilacidin was shown to significantly reduce the occurrence of severe ulcerative oral mucositis by more than 90% compared to placebo. Brilacidin and related compounds have shown antibacterial, anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties in various pre-clinical studies. We believe that the combination of these attributes contributed to the efficacy of Brilacidin in these animal studies.
 
The Company is engaged in a clinical trial titled, “Phase 2, Multi-center, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Brilacidin Oral Rinse Administered Daily for 7 Weeks in Attenuating Oral Mucositis in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer Receiving Concurrent Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy”. Interim analysis has shown a marked reduction in incidence of Severe OM (WHO Grade ≥ 3) observed in patients treated with Brilacidin who received at least 55 Gy cumulative units of radiation: Active Arm (Brilacidin): 2 of 9 patients (22.2 percent); Control Arm (Placebo): 7 of 10 patients (70 percent). In addition to good safety and tolerability, plasma samples from 6 patients treated with Brilacidin were analyzed and all concentrations of Brilacidin were below the lower limit of quantification (i.e., < 10 ng/mL).
 
The clinical trial is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Brilacidin as an oral rinse in preventing and controlling OM in patients receiving chemoradiation therapy for head and neck cancer. The study recently completed full enrollment of 61 in the United States, approximately 30 each to Brilacidin treatment or to placebo (water). Brilacidin (45 mg/15 ml oral rinse—”swish and spit”) is administered 3 times daily across 7 weeks (49 days). Completion of the trial is anticipated later this year.
 
OM represents a great area of unmet medical need and its successful treatment is potentially very important to the Brilacidin development program. We believe that demonstration of efficacy with localized delivery and limited systemic absorption also serves to help anchor Brilacidin for potential use in multiple diseases.
 
Disease: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),[Ulcerative Proctitis /Proctosigmoiditis]
 
Given its unique immunomodulatory properties, we have also identified inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as an indication for treatment with Brilacidin. 
 
Brilacidin induced Clinical Remission in the majority of patients in our recently completed Phase 2, open-label, Proof-of-Concept (PoC) clinical trial evaluating Brilacidin for mild-to-moderate Ulcerative Proctitis / Ulcerative Proctosigmoiditis (UP/UPS), two types of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).
 
In this Phase 2 PoC trial, a total of 17 patients received treatment across three sequential, dose-escalated cohorts—Cohort A (6 patients); Cohort B (6 patients); and Cohort C (5 patients). Patients received Brilacidin, once daily, at 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg, respectively, administered per rectum as a retention enema for 42 days (6 weeks) of treatment. The Primary Efficacy Endpoint of the Brilacidin UP/UPS trial used Modified Mayo Disease Activity Index (MMDAI) scoring, a common measurement tool in managing Ulcerative Colitis preferred by many IBD specialists, to determine Clinical Remission at Day 42. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints included: change in MMDAI score, both Full and Partial, and change in patient Quality-of-Life as assessed by the Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ). 
 
Brilacidin was shown to be generally well-tolerated, with no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) experienced by patients, which is consistent with the low levels of systemic absorption of Brilacidin observed in the trial. Improvement in Quality-of-Life was reported with more than 60 percent of patients in each cohort achieving a clinically important ≥10-point (out of 70 points) or more improvement after six weeks of treatment. At least half of patients in Cohorts B and C also showed ≥20-point or more improvement.

This study also serves to anchor Brilacidin as a treatment that can be effective with localized delivery techniques.
 
Brilacidin is being developed as a novel, non-corticosteroid, non-biologic treatment, with formulation development plans including oral tablets for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease and foam and/or gel for the treatment of UP/UPS.
 
 Disease: Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infection (ABSSSI)
 
The intravenous formulation of our lead antibiotic candidate, Brilacidin, has the potential to treat a variety of infections, including ABSSSI, caused by drug-sensitive or drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, including Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and by other Gram-positive bacteria.
 
The Phase 2b trial entitled “A Randomized, Double-Blind Study Comparing Three Dosing Regimens of Brilacidin to Daptomycin in the Treatment of Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections (ABSSSI)” completed enrollment in August 2014. On October 23, 2014, we announced positive top-line efficacy data from this Phase 2b ABSSSI trial.
 
In July 2015, at an End-of-Phase 2 Meeting, the Company and FDA discussed data supporting advancement of Brilacidin into Phase 3, as well as the basic elements of a Phase 3 program in ABSSSI. This was the first Host Defense Protein (HDP) mimic to advance through Phase 2. Because HDP mimics, such as Brilacidin, represent an entirely new class of antibiotics, there is no potential cross-resistance with currently marketed antibiotics, and due to its unique mechanism of action, resistance to Brilacidin is unlikely to develop. For this and other reasons, such as its high activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (a leading cause of ABSSSI), Brilacidin received designation as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) in November 2014. The QIDP designation was established as part of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in July 2012, for the purpose of encouraging pharmaceutical companies to develop new antimicrobial drugs to treat serious and life-threatening infections. Receiving QIDP designation means that Brilacidin is now eligible for additional FDA incentives in the approval and marketing path, including Fast Track designation and Priority Review for development and a potential five-year extension of market exclusivity.
 
The Phase 3 ABSSSI program would include two Phase 3 ABSSSI studies, as required by FDA Guidance (October 2013), of approximately 700 subjects in each study. The two studies may enroll subjects simultaneously. In addition, the first study would include an interim analysis after a portion of the patients has been enrolled. This would provide an early assessment of both safety and efficacy.
 
We submitted our Phase 3 protocol under a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) request to the FDA. The Phase 3 protocol SPA request included specific questions from the Company to facilitate a meaningful dialogue with the FDA on the proposed study design. We have received from the FDA comments and considerations for incorporation into our study design. Contingent upon further discussion with the FDA, a Phase 3 program may be initiated.
 
Management estimates that the cost of an ABSSSI Phase 3 program would require significantly expanded capital beyond what is currently available and we, therefore, intend to be strategic in balancing progress in this portion of our portfolio.

Compound: Kevetrin
 
Disease: Ovarian Cancer
 
Kevetrin, our anti-cancer drug candidate, has completed a Phase 1 study at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (“BIDMC”). The clinical trial evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of Kevetrin in patients with advanced-stage solid tumors of various types. The primary endpoints for the study were safety, determining the maximum tolerated dose, and establishing the dose for future Phase 2 clinical trials.
 
Clinical exposure to Kevetrin as measured by plasma concentrations have been achieved which are greater than concentrations shown to induce apoptosis in non-clinical studies. While the trial was primarily to evaluate safety of repeated cycles of Kevetrin, it is encouraging that some patients have had stabilization of tumor status during treatment. Further, Kevetrin appears to be having the expected effects on p53 in a number of the patients treated, as measured by increases in the levels of the downstream protein p21 biomarker.
 
Pharmacokinetic profiles found that Kevetrin has a relatively short biological half-life (less than 2 hours) in plasma. Plasma half-life (T1/2) clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd) suggest that drug elimination predominantly involves hepatic mechanisms and Kevetrin undergoes rapid extensive distribution from systemic circulation into tissues. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data, as measured by area under the curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) levels, further revealed that Kevetrin exhibited a dose-dependent response, has as stated a relatively short half-life (approximately 2 hours) and clears the body within one day - on average between 8 and 10 hours - though the drug can remain in the body up to approximately 24 hours, depending upon individual patient variations. The Phase 1 trial of Kevetrin trial yielded data supporting the safety of Kevetrin. 
 
The Company has commenced a Phase 2a trial of Kevetrin in treating late-stage ovarian cancer. The main objective of the trial focuses on confirming the modulation by Kevetrin of p53 pathways in tumors, as well as monitoring the response of tumors to the treatment. Presently and concurrent with the Phase 2a trial is the development of an oral formulation of Kevetrin for treating cancer. Pharmacokinetic data collected on Kevetrin during the initial clinical trial demonstrates that the compound has a short half-life of approximately two hours. Kevetrin’s short half-life makes it a compelling candidate for an oral drug delivery treatment for the main purpose of allowing simple daily, or multiple-times daily, administrations within or outside the hospital setting. Compared to injectable or intravenous treatments, oral therapy is the preferred drug delivery method of patients. Preliminary laboratory studies are encouraging and support the potential of developing an oral formulation, but there are no assurances made or implied that the Company will be successful in completing development of an oral formulation. Toxicology studies for the oral formulation of Kevetrin began January 2017.
 
Resources allocated to these activities are, however, currently strategically measured in order to assure that adequate support is available for completion of critical clinical trial activities in the Brilacidin and Prurisol programs.
 
Kevetrin was granted FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ovarian cancer, retinoblastoma, and pancreatic cancer and FDA Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for the treatment of retinoblastoma.
 
In further preclinical testing by independent researchers at the University of Bologna in Italy, recent data were found to be supportive of the potential for Kevetrin in treatment of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). We intend to further address this potential once we have available to us additional capital and resources.
 
Other Compounds Owned by the Company
 
The Company owns other compounds which have been identified as possible candidates for development for treating diseases including autism (KM 391), arthritis (KM277), asthma (KM 278), MS/ALS/Parkinson’s (KM 362), cancer (KM 3174), hypertensive emergency (KM 732), and bacterial and fungal infections. Development of these compounds are paused while the Company focuses its resources on its lead compounds.

We rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality and non-use agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our patent strategy is designed to facilitate commercialization of our current and future product candidates, and create barriers to entry.
 
Impairment of Patents
 
In the latter part of April 2016, the Company wrote off its patent rights to Delparantag. Delparantag was acquired by the Company in the purchase of assets from the Polymedix estate. The Company believes the compound which had clinical activity but also safety concerns in a prior clinical trial by Polymedix, is now a low priority compound for further development among the compounds in the Company’s portfolio. The decision by management was made after factoring in today’s regulatory and litigious climate. The Company recorded impairment loss on the patent costs of Delparantag and for various patents totaling approximately $648,000 (i.e. the cost of $782,000 less $134,000 of accumulated amortization) in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.
Payments Related to Assignment of Compounds
 
The Company has been assigned all rights, title, and interest to the following eight pharmaceutical compounds: Kevetrin, KM 277, KM 278, KM 362, KM 3174, KM 732, and KM-391. The Company agreed to pay the assignors 5% of net sales of the compounds in countries where composition of matter patents have been issued and 3% of net sales in other countries. Kevetrin, KM 277, KM 278 and KM 362 were acquired by the Company from Dr. Krishna Menon, a Director, the Company’s President of Research and Chief Scientific Officer, and a principal shareholder. With regard only to Kevetrin, the allocation of the 5% of net sales would be as follows: 2% to Dr. Menon, 2% to an unaffiliated third party, and 1% to Leo Ehrlich, our CEO. With respect to KM 732, the Company has agreed to pay an individual a fixed payment if the compound is approved for sale in the U.S. The Company owns all rights to Prurisol. For more information about the Company’s approval process relating to related party transactions, see “Item 13 – Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”

MANUFACTURING 
 
The Company does not intend to establish manufacturing capabilities or facilities to produce its drug product candidates (compounds) in the near or mid-term. The Company believes it can contract or partner with third parties for the manufacturing of its investigational compounds at sites registered with the FDA and contract with third-party scientists for pharmaco-kinetic, pharmaco-dynamic and toxicology studies. Such studies generally must be completed prior to filing an investigational new drug (IND) application with the FDA, and an IND is necessary to begin the human safety and efficacy trials of its compounds (Phase 1, 2 and 3).
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 
Our operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, distribution, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, approval, advertising and promotion, and import and export of our investigational products. Failure to comply with FDA requirements may result in enforcement action, including warning letters, fines, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of a product from the market. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, which is our primary initial focus, we anticipate seeking approval to market our products in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences. 
Development and Approval
 
Product development and the product approval process are very expensive and time consuming, and we cannot be certain that the FDA will grant approval for any of our drug product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Under the FDCA, the FDA must approve any new drug before it can be sold in the United States. The general process for obtaining FDA approval of a drug is as follows: 
Preclinical Testing 
 
Before we can test a drug candidate in humans, we must develop extensive preclinical data, generally derived from laboratory evaluations of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in animals, to generate data to support the drug’s quality and potential safety and benefits. Certain animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act. Presently we have a number of compounds that are in preclinical testing.
 
We submit this preclinical data and other information to the FDA in an IND. Human clinical trials cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. Based on the data and information contained in the IND, the FDA must determine whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug candidate in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA.
 
Clinical Trials 
 
Once the IND goes into effect, we study an investigational drug in human clinical trials to determine if the drug is safe and effective for a particular use. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. FDA reviews each protocol that is submitted to the IND. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by, and conducted under the auspices of, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each institution conducting the clinical trial. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting adverse events. Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and, if necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if the agency deems such inspection necessary.

In general, clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years to complete, and are very expensive. These three phases are as follows: 
 
Phase 1. The investigational drug is given to a small number of human subjects to test for safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In most disease states Phase 1 studies are performed in healthy volunteers. In cancer, Phase 1 studies generally are performed in cancer patients.
 
Phase 2. The investigational drug is given to a limited patient population to determine the initial effect of the drug in treating the disease, the best dose of the drug, and the possible side effects and safety risks of the drug. Phase 2 trials typically are controlled studies. 
 
Phase 3. If Phase 2 clinical trials of a compound yield promising data regarding safety and effectiveness, the compound may be advanced to Phase 3 clinical trials to confirm those results. Phase 3 clinical trials typically are long-term, involve a significantly larger population of patients, are conducted at numerous sites in different geographic regions, and are carefully designed to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and benefits of a drug and to form the basis for labeling. It is not uncommon for a drug that appears promising in Phase 2 clinical trials to fail in the more rigorous and reliable Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 
At any point in this process, the development of a drug could be stopped for a number of reasons, including safety concerns and lack of treatment benefit. We cannot be certain that any clinical trials that we are currently conducting, or any that we conduct in the future, will be completed successfully or within any specified time period. We may choose, or the FDA or an IRB may require us, to delay or suspend our clinical trials at any time if, for example, it appears that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate does not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit. Success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials, and data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent further development and regulatory approval.
 
FDA Approval Process 
 
If we believe that the data from the Phase 3 clinical trials show an adequate level of safety and effectiveness, we will file a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA seeking approval to sell the drug for a particular use. When an NDA is submitted, the FDA conducts a preliminary review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to be accepted for filing. If it is not, the FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information, and review of the application is delayed. 
 
Upon accepting the NDA for filing, the FDA will review the NDA and may hold a public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisors considers key questions regarding the drug. This advisory committee makes a recommendation to the FDA, which is not binding on the FDA, but is generally followed. 
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain applications for approval must include an assessment, generally based on clinical study data, of the safety and effectiveness of the subject drug in relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may waive or defer the requirement for a pediatric assessment, either at the company’s request or by the agency’s initiative. The FDA may determine that a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a new product outweigh its risks. A REMS may include various elements, ranging from a medication guide or patient package insert to limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, depending on what the FDA considers necessary for the safe use of the drug.

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product will be manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities for the drug, including those of companies who manufacture our drugs for us and including foreign establishments that may manufacture the product for sale in the U.S., comply with cGMP requirements (described below) and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
 
If the FDA concludes that an NDA does not meet the regulatory standards for approval, the FDA typically issues a Complete Response letter communicating the agency’s decision not to approve the application and outlining the deficiencies in the submission. The Complete Response letter also may request further information, including additional preclinical or clinical data or improvements to manufacturing processes, procedures, or facilities. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA still does not meet the standards for approval.
 
The FDA may reject an application because, among other reasons, it believes that the drug is not safe enough, or effective enough, or because it does not believe that the data submitted are reliable or conclusive. FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor. Obtaining regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources, and depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the disease or condition the drug is intended to address, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials.
 
If the FDA agrees that the compound has met the required level of safety and effectiveness for a particular use, it will approve the NDA, allowing the Company to sell the drug in the United States for that use. As a condition of approval, the FDA may impose restrictions that could affect the commercial success of a drug. For example, the FDA could require post-approval commitments, including completion within a specified time period of additional clinical studies, which often are referred to as “Phase 4” or “post-marketing” studies. The FDA also may limit the scope of the approved uses of the drug. Certain post-approval modifications to the drug product, such as changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a sponsor to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials, to be submitted in a new or supplemental NDA, which would require FDA approval.
 
Should our products be approved for marketing, we would also be subject to various other State and Federal laws concerning the marketing and cost reimbursement of our products.
 
Major jurisdictions outside the United States, such as the European Union, Japan and Canada, have similarly rigorous regulatory processes. They may also require studies not required by the FDA, which can add to the cost and risk of development. Products approved by the FDA might not be approved in these other countries. After review by the health authorities, pricing and cost reimbursement are also subject to separate approvals in many of these countries.
 
Post-Approval Regulation
 
Even if regulatory approval is granted, a marketed drug product is subject to continuing comprehensive requirements under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, including requirements and restrictions regarding adverse event reporting, recordkeeping, marketing, and compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). Adverse events reported after approval of a drug can result in additional restrictions on the use of a drug or requirements for additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials. The FDA or similar agencies in other countries may also require labeling changes to products at any time based on new safety information. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market, the FDA or similar agencies in other countries may at any time withdraw product approval or take actions that would suspend marketing or approval.

Good Manufacturing Practices. Companies engaged in manufacturing drug products or their components must comply with applicable cGMP requirements and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. If, after approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements and conditions of product approval may lead the FDA to seek sanctions, including fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution.

Advertising and Promotion. The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for advertising, promotion to physicians and patients, communications regarding unapproved uses, and industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and other restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and state authorities, as well as civil and criminal fines and agreements that may materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.

Other Requirements. In addition, companies that manufacture or distribute drug products or that hold approved NDAs must comply with other regulatory requirements, including submitting annual reports, reporting information about adverse drug experiences, submitting establishment registrations and drug listings, and maintaining certain records.

 
Hatch-Waxman Act
 
Drugs that are approved for commercial marketing in the U.S. under an NDA are subject to the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the “Hatch-Waxman Act.” The Hatch-Waxman Act established two abbreviated approval pathways, including the 505(b)(2) pathway, for drug products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved NDA products. We are utilizing advantages in this 505(b)(2) pathway for the development of Prurisol. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides companies with marketing exclusivity for new chemical entities, allows companies to apply to extend for up to five additional years of patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an NDA, and provides for a period of marketing exclusivity for products that are not new chemical entities if the NDA (or supplemental NDA) contains data from new clinical investigations that were necessary for approval. It also provides a means for approving generic versions of a drug product once the marketing exclusivity period has ended and all relevant patents have expired or have been successfully challenged and defeated. The laws of other key markets likewise create both opportunities for exclusivity periods and patent protections and the possibility of generic competition once such periods or protections have either expired or have been successfully challenged by generic entrants.
 
Orphan Drug Exclusivity
 
The Orphan Drug Act established incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting less than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. at the time of the request for orphan designation. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition and meets other applicable requirements, the FDA grants orphan drug designation to the product for that use. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to Kevetrin for use in the treatment of ovarian cancer, retinoblastoma and pancreatic cancer. The benefits of orphan drug designation include tax credits for clinical testing expenses and exemption from user fees. A drug candidate that is approved for the orphan drug designated use typically is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity.

17

Pediatric Exclusivity
 
Section 505A of the FDCA provides for six months of additional exclusivity if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be safe and effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection that cover the drug are extended by six months.
Qualified Infectious Disease Product Exclusivity
 
The Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act amended the FDCA to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop new antimicrobial drugs to treat serious and life-threatening infections. Among other measures, GAIN grants an additional five years of marketing exclusivity for new antibacterial or antifungal human drugs designated under the law as a “qualified infectious disease product” (QIDP). This five-year period of exclusivity is in addition to any existing regulatory exclusivity, including Hatch-Waxman, orphan drug, or pediatric exclusivity. In addition, QIDPs are eligible for fast-track designation and priority review to facilitate expedited development and review processes with the FDA. Our investigational drug Brilacidin has been granted QIDP designation as a potential new treatment for ABSSSI.
Fast Track Designation and Priority Review
 
Certain of our product candidates, such as Brilacidin, may qualify for Fast Track designation. The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs involving serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. If a drug receives Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider reviewing sections of the NDA on a rolling basis, rather than requiring the entire application to be submitted to begin the review. Products with Fast Track designation also may be eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondence with the FDA about the product’s development. 
 
Certain of our product candidates, such as Brilacidin, also may qualify for priority review. Priority review is available to a drug that treats a serious condition and that, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review designation provides for a six-month review goal for an NDA, rather than the standard 10-month review timeframe.
 
Other FDA programs intended to expedite development and review include accelerated approval, which allows the FDA to approve a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, and breakthrough therapy designation, which is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence shows that the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy.
 
Even if a product qualifies for Fast Track designation or breakthrough therapy designation, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification and may rescind the designation. Moreover, none of these programs assures ultimate approval of an investigational product. FDA may determine that the product does not meet the standards for approval.

COMPETITION
 
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. The drugs that we are developing will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. Many pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies have products on the market and are actively engaged in the research and development of products that are competitive with our potential products. Many of these companies and institutions, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, sales, distribution and technical resources and more experience in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory matters, than we do. In addition, our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and drugs that are more effective, better tolerated or less costly than any which are being developed by us or which would render our technology or potential drugs obsolete or noncompetitive. 
 
With respect to Kevetrin, our lead compound for cancer, there are many drugs approved to treat cancers and many more in the publicly disclosed development pipeline. The same is true for our other compounds in clinical trials, Prurisol and Brilacidin. There are many drugs approved to treat various forms of psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and ABSSSI, and many more in the publicly disclosed development pipeline. However, there is no drug yet to be approved for preventing severe oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients. Our success depends on our ability to identify types of these respective diseases where our drugs have an advantage over existing therapies and those in the publicly disclosed development pipeline.
