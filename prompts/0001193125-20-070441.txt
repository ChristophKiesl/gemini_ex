ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 PAE is a leading, highly diversified, global company that provides a broad range of operational solutions and outsourced services to meet the critical, enduring needs of the U.S. Government, other allied governments, international organizations and companies. PAE merges technology with advanced business practices to deliver faster, smarter and more efficient managed services. Whether clients require high-profile support to operate large U.S. embassies around the world or need technical solutions for programs that monitor bioterrorism agents, PAE delivers for its customers. PAE leverages its scale, over 60 years of experience and talented global workforce of approximately 20,000 to provide the essential services PAEs clients need to tackle some of the worlds toughest challenges. 
 Over PAEs extensive history, it has delivered mission-critical services to the U.S. Government and international partners. When PAEs clients need support for critical missions around the globe, PAE has service offerings to meet their requirements in numerous areas, including counter-threat advisory services, training, systems testing, space development and operations, information optimization, business process outsourcing, technology, forensics, logistics, operations, maintenance and other essential services. 
 PAEs business model is founded on deep-rooted relationships with key customers, a lean cost structure and a global presence with local knowledge and specialized technical expertise. PAE has a diversified set of long-term customer contracts that drive backlog and stable, visible growth with no single contract providing more than 8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, PAEs experienced management has grown its capabilities over the past decade through the successful identification and integration of carefully targeted acquisitions that aim to expand its markets and margins. PAE expects to continue to leverage its scale and capital structure in order to pursue additional acquisition opportunities that will further broaden its capabilities, customer access and addressable markets as PAE looks to participate in the consolidation of a fragmented industry and capitalize on synergy opportunities. A significant portion of PAEs growth is in key national security markets. 
 Based in Falls Church, Virginia, PAE operates through two primary segments  Global Mission Services (GMS) and National Security Solutions (NSS). GMS and NSS contributed 76% and 24%, respectively, to revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. See Segments for further discussion of PAEs segments.

Competition 
 PAE operates in the public and private sectors to perform activities that are highly competitive in a variety of environments, across business lines and geographic boundaries. The industries in which PAE operates consist of a large number of enterprises ranging from small, niche-oriented companies to multi-billion dollar corporations that serve many government and commercial customers. Competition is measured by various factors, including services offered, experience, price, geographic reach and mobility. PAEs competitive advantage stems from distinctive technical competencies, its established track record of past performance, domain expertise, experience in the industry, deep-rooted customer relationships and the size of PAEs vetted workforce. PAEs principal competitors include Amentum, Booz Allen Hamilton, CACI International Inc., Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., KBR, Inc., Leidos, Parsons Corporation and Science Applications International Corporation.

 Backlog 
 PAE defines backlog to include the following two components: 
 

 | Funded: Funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Unfunded: Unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts. Unfunded backlog includes (i) unexercised option years, to the extent their issuance or exercise is probable, as well as (ii) contract awards, to the extent PAE believes contract execution and funding is probable.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 PAE does not include the ceiling amount of Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts in backlog. Only awarded IDIQ task orders are included in backlog. PAEs backlog includes orders under contracts that in some cases extend for several years. For example, the U.S. Congress generally appropriates funds for PAEs U.S. federal government customers on a yearly basis, even though their contracts with PAE may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years to complete. As a result, PAEs federal contracts typically are only partially funded at any point during their term and all or some of the work to be performed under the contracts may remain unfunded unless and until the U.S. Congress makes subsequent appropriations and the procuring agency allocates funding to the contract. As a result, while unfunded backlog has not yet been appropriated or otherwise authorized, substantially all unfunded backlog has historically converted to funded backlog. 
 As of December 31, 2019, PAEs backlog was $6.4 billion, of which $1.5 billion was funded and $4.9 billion was unfunded. As of December 31, 2018, PAEs backlog was $6.1 billion, of which $1.8 billion was funded and $4.3 billion was unfunded. Backlog is converted to revenue as work is performed over the life of a contract. Backlog consists of remaining performance obligations (see Note 4, Revenues, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Shay Holding Corporation included in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2020 (as amended on March 11, 2020, the Super 8-K), plus unexercised options. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2019, including its joint ventures, PAEs workforce numbered approximately 20,000 across approximately 60 countries around the world and all seven continents. Approximately 75% of its employees are located in the United States. Approximately 24% of PAEs workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements. PAE believes that its employee relations are generally good. 
Regulatory Matters 
 Government Contracts 
 Government Procurement Regulations. PAEs business is impacted by government procurement, anti-bribery, international trade, environmental, health and safety and other federal civil and criminal laws, regulations and requirements. Below is a summary of some of the significant laws and regulations that impact PAEs business. This summary is not exhaustive and many other laws and regulations may apply, including those of jurisdictions outside the United States. 
 The services PAE provides to the U.S. Government are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and agency FAR supplements, the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data requirements (commonly referred to as the Truth in Negotiations Act), the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), the Service Contract Act, the False Claims Act (FCA), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), export control requirements, Department of Defense (DoD) security regulations, federal employment laws and regulations (including equal opportunity and affirmative action requirements), as well as many other laws and regulations. These laws and regulations affect how PAE transacts business with its clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on PAEs business operations. A violation of specific laws and regulations could lead to fines, contract termination or suspension of future contracts. Generally, PAEs government clients can also terminate, renegotiate or modify any of their contracts with PAE at their convenience, and many of PAEs government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually. 

 | The FAR sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. Government. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit requirements and restrictions on organizational conflicts of interest. A contractors failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination and the assessment of penalties and fines that could lead to suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.

 | The FCA imposes civil liability and criminal fines on individuals or entities that knowingly submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. Violations of the FCA and other similar laws may result in criminal fines, imprisonment and civil penalties for each false claim submitted and debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. The FCA also allows private individuals to bring a suit on behalf of the U.S. Government against an individual or entity for violations of the FCA. These suits, also known as qui tam actions, may be brought by, with only a few exceptions, any private citizen who has material information of a false claim that has not yet been previously disclosed.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The requirement for Truthful Cost or Pricing Data mandates that, when applicable, PAE provides current, accurate and complete cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of contracts, modifications or task orders that are not subject to full and open competition (e.g., a sole-source procurement).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. Other jurisdictions in which PAE does business have similar laws.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Bid Protests. Disappointed bidders and firms excluded from competition for U.S. Government contracts and task orders can avail themselves of bid protest remedies by submitting a protest challenging the agencys award decision to the agency, the Government Accountability Office bid protest office, or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims within specified time limits. Contract performance can be suspended while a protest is pending, and an awarded contract can be terminated for convenience if found to have been improperly awarded, typically requiring the agency to make a new award decision. 
 Cost Allowability. Under U.S. Government regulations, certain costs, including certain financing costs, portions of research and development costs, lobbying expenses, certain types of legal expenses and certain marketing expenses related to the preparation of bids and proposals, are not allowed for pricing purposes and calculation of contract reimbursement rates under cost-reimbursement contracts. The U.S. Government also regulates the methods by which allowable costs may be allocated under U.S. Government contracts. 
 Classified Programs. PAE is involved in U.S. Government programs that are classified by the U.S. Government and is limited in its ability to provide information about such programs. The operating results of these classified programs are included in PAEs consolidated financial statements. The business risks and considerations associated with these classified programs generally do not differ materially from those of PAEs other U.S. Government contracts and generally are subject to the same oversight and internal controls as other U.S. Government contracts. 
U.S. Government Contracting Process and Contract Types 
 The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 generally requires U.S. Government agencies to obtain full and open competition in selecting companies to perform most contracts. If a U.S. Government agency has a requirement for goods or services, it typically posts its requirements on the FedBizOpps.gov website. Interested contractors submit information indicating their desire to perform the required services. The agency then solicits competitive offers from qualified contractors; in the case of negotiated procurements, it typically issues a formal request for a proposal (RFP). The RFP describes the desired goods or services and terms and conditions that will form the final agency contract. In negotiated procurements, the RFP includes the evaluation criteria the agency will use to determine which contractor will be selected for the contract. Offerors then submit proposals in response to the RFP, and the agency evaluates all the proposals, and, in its discretion, may ask for clarifications and engage in discussions with offerors. 
 Agencies may award negotiated contracts on a best value basis, which means that the contractor selected for the award should, in the agencys judgment, provide the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement, including technical merit, cost and relevant past performance considerations. This process can sometimes take a year or more. Alternatively, the RFP may specify that the award decision will be made on the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) basis, which focuses more on price as the determining factor in an award decision. In the past decade, the LPTA basis was widely used by agencies, though in recent years, Congress has adopted some restrictions on its use. 
 
7 


 In some cases, full and open competition is not required. Depending upon the circumstances, contracts can be awarded to contractors on a sole-source basis or with limited or restricted competition. For example, this can occur when the agencys need for the services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the United States would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals. A contract can also be awarded to a contractor on a sole-source basis, or limited or restricted competition, when the services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of services will satisfy the needs of the agency. From time to time, PAE is awarded contracts on a sole-source basis. 
 Government contracts are generally classified as single-award contracts or multi-award contracts. In single award contracts, PAE is chosen as the sole contractor under the applicable contract, whereas in multi-award contracts, it is one of multiple contractors. 
 Many of PAEs U.S. Government contracts are IDIQ contracts. IDIQ contracts are essentially umbrella contracts that set forth the basic terms and conditions under which an agency may order goods and services from one, and in many cases, more than one, contractor from time to time during the term of the IDIQ contract. Typically, these contracts will also specify the labor or skill categories that the government agency believes are necessary to perform the necessary contract work and may also specify the labor rates applicable for each contract labor and/or skill category. 
 A task order is issued by the agency to the holder or holders of the IDIQ award and calls for a specific set of services to be delivered by the contractor to a particular client agency. When task orders are issued under multi-award IDIQ contracts, each awardee is given a fair opportunity to be considered for the task order. The issuing agency will conduct a competition among the interested awardees and ultimately issue a task order to a single contractor. In PAEs experience, the key factors in bidding successfully for these task orders are technical merit, cost, relevant past performance considerations and client trust. IDIQ contracts do not obligate the U.S. Government to purchase goods or services above the minimum levels set forth in the contract. 
 From time to time, PAE is also party to multi-agency contracts or government-wide acquisition contracts, which are IDIQs that permit the aggregation of the requirements of multiple agenciesor across the entire federal governmentin a single contract. This type of contract is intended to encourage contractors to offer the best possible prices and to reduce the costs associated with awarding and administering multiple, separate contracts. 
 Government Audits 
 PAEs government contracts are subject to audits at various points in the contracting process. Pre-award audits may be performed prior to the award of cost-reimbursable contracts. The purpose of a pre-award audit is to determine the basis of the bid and provide the information required for the U.S. Government to negotiate the contract effectively. In addition, the U.S. Government may perform a pre-award audit to determine PAEs capability to perform under a contract. During the performance of a contract, the U.S. Government may have the right to examine PAEs costs incurred on the contract, including any labor charges, material purchases and overhead charges. Upon completion of a cost-reimbursable contract, the U.S. Government typically performs an incurred cost audit of all aspects of contract performance to ensure that PAE has performed the contract in a manner consistent with its proposal. The government also may perform a post-award audit for proposals that are subject to the requirements for Truthful Cost or Pricing Data to determine if the cost proposed and negotiated was accurate, current and complete as of the time of negotiations. 
 The U.S. Government and its agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA), the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the DoD Inspector General, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, and the DoL, routinely audit and review PAEs activities. These agencies review performance under PAEs contracts, its cost structure and its compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, as well as the adequacy of, and its compliance with, PAEs internal control systems and policies. In particular, the DCAA reviews the adequacy of, and PAEs compliance with, PAEs internal control systems and policies, including its labor, billing, accounting, purchasing, property, estimating, budgeting and planning, indirect vs. direct costs, and compensation and management information systems. The DCAA has the right to perform audits on PAEs incurred costs on all flexibly priced contracts on an annual basis. An adverse finding under a DCAA audit could result in the disallowance of PAEs costs under a U.S. Government contract, termination of U.S. Government contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension, and prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. Final approval of submitted yearly contract incurred costs may be years from the date of submission of the contract costs. PAE currently

  has ongoing audits of its incurred indirect costs in relation to certain contracts. See the section entitled Item 1A. Risk FactorsRisks Related to PAEs BusinessRisks Related to Performance and OperationA negative audit or other investigations by the U.S. Government could adversely affect PAEs ability to receive U.S. Government contracts and its future operating performance, and could result in financial or reputational harm, including disbarment from receiving government contracts for additional information. 
 At any given time, many of PAEs contracts may be under review by the DCAA and other government agencies. PAE cannot predict the outcome of such ongoing audits and what impact, if any, such audits may have on its future operating performance. 
 Over the last few years, U.S. Government contractors, including PAE, have seen a trend of increased scrutiny by the DCAA and other U.S. Government agencies, and PAE expects that this trend will continue. If any of its internal control systems or policies are found non-compliant or inadequate, payments may be suspended under PAEs contracts or it may be subjected to increased government scrutiny and approval that could delay or adversely affect its ability to invoice and receive timely payment on its contracts, perform contracts or compete for contracts with the U.S. Government. These adverse outcomes could also occur if the DCAA cannot timely complete periodic reviews of PAEs control systems. 
 International Operations 
 PAEs contracts performed internationally may be subject to additional U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including the FCPA, in addition to the local laws of the jurisdictions in which PAE operates. To the extent that PAE provides products, technical data and services outside the United States, it is also subject to U.S. laws and regulations governing international transactions. Those include but are not limited to: the International Traffic in Arms Regulations under the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Regulations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and financial and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and individuals and organizations that are specially designated national and blocked parties, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. 
 PAEs international operations are also subject to a multitude of local laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. PAE must comply with foreign government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, which may differ from U.S. Government requirements, including import-export control, labor laws, tax requirements, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings, and requirements to expend a portion of program funds in-country. In addition, international hostilities, political instability, and changes in currency values can also impact PAEs international operations. 
 Risk Insurance 
 PAE has tailored its casualty and property risk insurance programs to fit the business risk and to leverage costs of these solutions as part of its offerings to government customers. PAE has a high-deductible workers compensation policy to cover its domestic employees, and relies on Defense Base Act (the DBA) coverage for its international employees. The DBA generally requires insurance coverage to be provided to persons employed at U.S. military bases and certain contracts with or funded by the U.S. Government outside of the United States, the cost of which is typically passed to PAEs customers. PAEs high-deductible approach extends to automobile liability and property coverage, which includes rented equipment, including cranes and machinery. PAE self-insures automotive property for its owned, leased and rented vehicles as its fleet auto safety program enables it to maintain very low losses. Government-furnished equipment is generally not insured per the governments regulations. 
 PAEs operations cover a wide range of types and geographies. Therefore, PAE has implemented a diverse approach to specialty coverage, including aviation, marine, cargo, professional liability, kidnap and ransom, pollution, medical malpractice and business travel. PAEs business travel policy is comprehensive given the significant numbers of expatriate employees and the environments in which they work. In addition, PAE has corporate coverages, including directors and officers, fiduciary, crime and employment practices liability. 
 PAEs History 
 PAE has a long history of providing critical services to its customers all over the world. PAE was founded in 1955 as an architecture and engineering firm to provide facility design and construction supervision services to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Navy and Air Force based in Asia. PAE became one of the largest providers of diverse contract services to the Army during the Vietnam War era and employed thousands of personnel overseas.

 By the 1980s, PAE had developed into a diversified government services firm capable of performing operations anywhere in the world. During these years, PAEs services included providing operations and maintenance and related services to the U.S. Air Force in Spain, Greece, Japan and Honduras and to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Saudi Arabia, and providing commercial oil support services in Thailand. 
 Following the Cold War, PAE significantly expanded its geographic presence. PAE worked on contracts in many new countries, including Afghanistan, Nigeria, Iraq, Liberia, Bosnia, East Timor, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), the United Arab Emirates, Colombia, Bahrain, Sudan, Haiti, El Salvador and Ghana. 
 In 2006, Pacific Architects and Engineers, LLC and its subsidiaries (PAE LLC) were acquired by Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMC). During its ownership period, LMC broadened PAE LLCs service capabilities and expanded its infrastructure. PAE Holding Corporation (PAE Holding) was incorporated in the state of Delaware in February 2011 by an affiliate of Lindsay Goldberg, LLC (Lindsay Goldberg), and in April 2011, PAE Holding acquired PAE LLC from LMC; Lindsay Goldberg focused on expanding PAEs business, completing four acquisitions during the course of its ownership. Shay was incorporated in the state of Delaware in January 2016 by an affiliate of Platinum Equity, LLC (Platinum Equity), and in March 2016, Shays indirect subsidiary acquired PAE Holding from Lindsay Goldberg. During Platinum Equitys ownership period, PAE saw an increased focus on operational excellence and the continued pursuit of strategic initiatives. PAE executed targeted enhancements to its smart services platform for tech-enabled capabilities and innovative solutions that benefit its customers while expanding continuous improvement efforts to optimize its cost structure and competitiveness. 
 As further described in the Explanatory Note, on February 10, 2020, the Business Combination contemplated by the Merger Agreement was consummated and Shay (as it existed immediately prior to the Business Combination) was acquired by Gores III. In connection with the Business Combination, Gores Holdings III, Inc. changed its name to PAE Incorporated and as a result of the Business Combination, PAE Incorporated became the indirect owner of all of the equity interests of PAE Holding and its subsidiaries. 
 Acquisition History 
 Through organic growth and acquisitions, PAE has developed into a prominent services provider to the U.S. Government on a global scale. PAE has completed and integrated six significant acquisitions since 2011, most recently expanding its capabilities in international disaster response, adjudication support services and BPO. During this period, acquisitions allowed PAE to provide new services to existing customers while developing relationships with new customers and have helped PAE in its goal to continue growing its addressable markets and margins. 

 | In October 2011, PAE completed the acquisition of Defense Support Services LLC (DS2), a provider of aviation and base operation services to the military services and other customers. The DS2 acquisition added platform, aviation systems and facility maintenance, repair and overhaul capabilities to PAEs core offerings, as well as bolstered its base operations support and logistics capabilities.

 | In July 2013, PAE acquired the Applied Technology Division (ATD) of Computer Sciences Corporation. As a provider of space range and test and training range support services, adding ATD augmented PAEs base operating services. Through the two strategic acquisitions of DS2 and ATD, PAE successfully leveraged the combined companies strong reputation, past performance and established customer relationships in the business capture process. PAE also spread costs across a significantly larger contract base and became more competitive in each of its markets.
