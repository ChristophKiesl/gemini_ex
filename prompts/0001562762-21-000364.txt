Item 1. Business
General

PriceSmart exists to improve the lives and businesses of our Members, our employees and our communities by reliably and consistently providing quality goods and valuable services at the lowest possible prices. We believe that lower prices on products and services drive sales volume, which increases the Company’s buying leverage, which in turn leads to better pricing that we can then offer to our Members, validating the value of the annual membership fee. 

PriceSmart began operations in 1996 in San Diego, California, with the intent to bring our U.S. style membership shopping warehouse club concept to underserved countries. We currently operate 47 warehouse clubs in Central America, the Caribbean, and Colombia. We offer to our individual and business Members, a carefully-curated selection of high quality, brand name and private label consumer products, essential goods and direct-from-farm fresh produce. We also provide prepared foods and fresh-baked goods. Most all merchandise is available for delivery or contactless curbside pickup through our Click & Go™ service. Our clubs also provide services at our Optical, Pharmacy, Audiology, and Tire departments and serve food at great value at our food courts. Historically, our typical warehouse buildings have ranged in sales floor size from approximately 40,000 to 60,000 square feet and are located in and around the major cities in our markets to take advantage of dense populations and relatively higher levels of disposable income. Additionally, we operate smaller format clubs, with sales floors ranging from approximately 30,000 to 40,000 square feet. These smaller format clubs serve markets where the population may be less dense and/or where there may be significant business to business opportunities. In urban areas where it is difficult to secure sufficient real estate at a reasonable cost, we have utilized the smaller format option to access and serve that market. The option of using a smaller format club, coupled with our omni-channel initiatives, helps us expand our membership base and geographic reach in existing markets. We strategically invest in technology to enhance Member experience and convenience. Technology allows us to access valuable data that supports our ability to increase efficiencies and gain important insights about our Members. Most notably, we developed an e-commerce platform and in fiscal 2020 launched Click & Go™ online ordering, curbside pickup and delivery services in all 13 markets. We now provide digital membership and auto-renewal, for the convenience of our Members. We also provide wholesale supply services to a retailer in the Philippines. 

Logistics and distribution efficiencies are fundamental to delivering high quality merchandise at low prices to our Members. We utilize regional distribution centers in the U.S. and Costa Rica as well as several local distribution centers, to efficiently distribute merchandise, retain flexibility and alternatives to source and transport goods, and mitigate the risk of supply-chain disruption. As our business grows and includes more e-commerce activity, we continually evaluate how to utilize our logistics and distribution system to most efficiently provide merchandise to our Members.





Purchasing land and constructing warehouse clubs is generally our largest ongoing capital investment. Securing land for warehouse club locations is challenging in several of our markets because suitable sites at economically feasible prices are difficult to find. We believe real estate ownership provides a number of advantages as compared to leasing, including lower operating expenses, flexibility to expand or otherwise enhance our buildings, long-term control over the use of the property and the residual value that the real estate may have in future years. Although we prefer to own real estate, we sometimes lease our real estate when leasing provides the best available opportunity.

Our warehouse clubs currently operate in emerging markets that historically have had higher growth rates and lower warehouse club market penetration than the U.S. market. In the countries in which we operate, we do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators. However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, cash and carry, home improvement centers, electronic retailers, specialty stores, convenience stores, traditional wholesale distribution and growing online sales.

The number of warehouse clubs in operation for each country or territory were as follows:

Our warehouse clubs, one regional distribution center and several smaller local distribution centers are located in Latin America and the Caribbean, and our corporate headquarters, U.S. buying operations and our larger regional distribution center are located primarily in the United States. Our operating segments are the United States, Central America, the Caribbean and Colombia.

We are currently proceeding with the construction of three warehouse clubs. The first will be a standard format warehouse club located in Guatemala City, Guatemala, which will be our fifth warehouse club located in Guatemala. We expect to open this warehouse club in late October 2021. The second will be a smaller format warehouse club located within the city of Bucaramanga, Colombia. We expect to open this warehouse club, which will be our ninth warehouse club in Colombia, in November 2021. The third will be a standard format warehouse club located within the city of Portmore, Jamaica. Portmore is a suburb west of the capital city of Kingston. We expect to open this warehouse club, which will be our second warehouse club in Jamaica, in the spring of 2022. Once these three new clubs are open, the Company will operate 50 warehouse clubs.

From March 2018 through September 2021, we operated a cross border package forwarding (casillero) and online marketplace business under the “Aeropost” banner in 38 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. PriceSmart acquired Aeropost in 2018 to leverage Aeropost’s technology and its management’s experience in developing software and systems for e-commerce and logistics to advance PriceSmart’s development of an omni-channel shopping experience for its Members. In October 2021, PriceSmart sold the legacy casillero and marketplace operations, which were not core to our main objectives. PriceSmart retained key Aeropost personnel, technology and procedures as part of the transaction, with which we believe we can continue to leverage and grow our omni-channel business. This technology and talent have helped us combine our brick and mortar operations with online capabilities, supported by a more sophisticated distribution system that provides us with the potential to expand our geography, reach more Members in more ways and continue to develop approaches to gain efficiencies, reduce costs and provide Members with great value.





We recognize the uncertainty created from the outbreak of COVID-19 and the known and unknown potential social and economic impacts in the markets where we operate and take measures as warranted to reasonably protect our employees, Members, and business. We continue to closely monitor operating results and cash flows in an effort to ensure optimal timing of future investments and warehouse club openings. For information regarding actions we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, please see Part II. “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition - Factors Affecting the Business - COVID-19 Updates.”

Merchandising

Our strategy is to make available to our Members a curated selection of high quality merchandise sourced from around the world and valuable services, with lower margins than traditional retail stores. 

We offer merchandise in the following categories:

Foods & Sundries consists primarily of our grocery, cleaning supplies, health & beauty and canned foods products and constituted approximately 50% of net merchandise sales for fiscal 2021.
Fresh Foods consists primarily of our meat, produce, deli, seafood and poultry products and constituted approximately 29% of net merchandise sales for fiscal 2021. 
Hardlines consists primarily of our electronics, appliances, hardware, sporting goods, and toy products and constituted approximately 12% of net merchandise sales for fiscal 2021. 
Softlines consists primarily of apparel, domestics and furniture products and constituted approximately 5% of our net merchandise sales for fiscal 2021. 
Other Business consists primarily of our food service, optical, tire center and other ancillary services and constituted approximately 4% of net merchandise sales for fiscal 2021. 

Across various categories, we offer exciting and unique seasonal merchandise and rotational programs that offer unique value throughout the year.

Competitive Strengths

Low Operating Costs. Our format is designed to move merchandise from our suppliers to our Members at a lower expense ratio than our competitors. We strive to achieve efficiencies in product distribution, minimizing the labor required to stock and display merchandise, limiting non-payroll operating expenses and maintaining low occupancy costs. For example, we offer a limited number of stock keeping units (SKUs) with large pack sizes, which allows us to keep shelves stocked with less labor cost than competitors that offer a greater number of SKUs. More recently, we also have opened distribution centers in certain of our high volume markets to improve efficiency and in-stock rate, reduce lead times on high volume products, and mitigate risks of supply chain disruption. Our focus on driving down operating costs allows us to offer better value and lower prices to our Members, which we believe helps generate Member loyalty and renewals, which in turn leads to increased sales. 

Membership. Our membership model in and of itself provides a competitive advantage. Our membership represents a desirable demographic concentration with strong purchasing power in our markets. The data we can access about our membership base not only provides better connectivity with our Members, but also enables us to identify and pursue additional opportunities to provide value for our Members. Membership has been a basic operating characteristic in the warehouse club industry, beginning over 45 years ago at Price Club, the first warehouse club. Membership promotes Member loyalty, and membership fees contribute to our ability to operate our business on lower margins than conventional retailers and wholesalers and were equal to approximately 1.6% of net merchandise sales in fiscal 2021. Our Members can sign up for and renew their memberships online, which gives us another valuable digital touch point with them.

During fiscal 2021, we completed the expansion of our Platinum Membership rewards program to all 13 of our markets. Nicaragua and El Salvador were the final two markets to launch this program in fiscal year 2021. Similarly, we continue to expand our product and services offerings to Members. One of our primary initiatives has been the expansion of our Wellness programs, which include our Optical, Pharmacy and Audiology departments. As of August 31, 2021, we had 38 Optical locations open in nine of our markets, and three Pharmacy locations, all in our Costa Rica market. We expect to continue our rollout of Optical to most of our remaining clubs and markets in fiscal year 2022. In addition, we plan to continue to increase our Pharmacy locations in fiscal 2022, primarily in Costa Rica, and began launching Audiology centers in some of our markets in early fiscal 2022. We believe that untapped opportunities exist to further enhance the value of our membership in various areas. We continue to explore opportunities to provide our Members with products and services that are particularly attractive to our unique membership base while expanding current programs such as our co-branded credit card benefits. 
‎





Business Members. Our product selection, larger pack sizes, and low prices appeal to both business and retail consumers. Our business Members include a broad cross section of businesses such as restaurants, institutions including schools, and other businesses that purchase products for resale or use in their operations. These business Members represent a significant source of sales and profit and provide purchasing volume that gives us better prices from our suppliers.

Worldwide Sourcing.  Approximately 48% of our sales come from merchandise sourced in the U.S., Asia and Europe. One of the primary advantages we have compared to most of our competitors is our United States-based buying team that sources merchandise from suppliers in the U.S. and around the world.  Our buyers identify and purchase new and exciting items, including our own Member’s Selection private label products. Many of these branded products are available only at PriceSmart in the markets in which we operate.

Innovation. The warehouse club industry has been operating for over forty years, following the founding of Price Club in 1976. The world of merchandising has evolved during this period, particularly with respect to how technology impacts operational efficiencies and how consumers shop. We are leveraging technological innovations we have developed to enhance our worldwide sourcing of products and make them available in our developing and emerging countries in a manner that meets current consumer preferences. We operate effectively in multiple markets, many of which are relatively small, with different legal requirements, local buying opportunities, cultural norms, unique distribution and logistical challenges and Member preferences that require our unique ability to source the correct mix of local versus imported merchandise. We believe that our future success is highly dependent on our capacity to continue to adapt and innovate to meet the needs of our current and future Members. While not yet as prevalent as in the U.S., online sales penetration is increasing in the markets where we operate, especially as a result of the mobility restrictions imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Click & Go™ service, which allows our Members to order online and pick up their orders curbside at our warehouse club locations, is available in all 13 of our markets. We expect to expand our omni-channel offering to include additional services such as drop-ship, the creation of a digital business-to-business application and a native mobile application for our Members. We have also developed better in-bound and outbound online communication channels, and we are using data analytics to better understand our Members’ evolving preferences.

Experienced Management Team. Sherry S. Bahrambeygui is PriceSmart’s Chief Executive Officer. She has led several new transformational initiatives that have allowed us to retain the key benefits of our business model, while expanding capabilities that generate new ways of approaching our business, including the omni-channel platform and adoption and application of new technology and data analytics to drive growth. As a Board member, she has been instrumental to the evolution of the Company’s governance and other strategic initiatives for the past nine years. Michael L. McCleary is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. McCleary joined the Company in 2003 and has over 30 years of international finance, tax and accounting experience. In addition to Ms. Bahrambeygui and Mr. McCleary, the other members of our management team have extensive career experience in the warehouse club business. Many of our executives learned the warehouse club business from their time at Price Club. Their experience and knowledge represent a key strength and competitive advantage for our company. We have also retained key executives from when we acquired Aeropost in March 2018, who are experienced in developing online technology and marketing for e-commerce and who have assisted us in increasing our digital interaction with Members. We continue making investments in talent to support our technology development and other administrative functions.

Effective September 1, 2021, Nicolas Maslowski was promoted to a newly created position for the Company, Executive Vice President, Member Experience and Strategic Analytics. Prior to this promotion, Mr. Maslowski served as the Senior Vice President of PriceSmart Member Experience. Since joining PriceSmart, he has expanded the capabilities of our leadership team, made great strides in helping us better understand our Members, and helped develop and oversee the effective utilization of data and technology to increase sales by extracting valuable insights and strengthening the connection with our Members. In addition, he has helped show how the infusion of user-friendly data and reports positively impacts business decision-making throughout the Company.
‎





Growth Strategy

Our growth strategy includes:

Continue to increase the value of Membership. 

Leverage our sourcing expertise and buying power to identify and acquire exceptional products we can provide to Members at great values.
Build on our brand loyalty by expanding our private label products to include more categories in cases where we can reduce costs while maintaining quality, giving us the opportunity to lower prices.
Pursue opportunities to increase our control of aspects of the supply chain and invest in areas where we can reduce costs and pass the savings on to our Members.
Increase focus on serving the specific needs of business-to-business Members.
Expand services, particularly those focused on Member well-being, such as pharmacy, optical and audiology.
Continue developing technology that provides Members with greater convenience and options for their shopping experience.
Optimize membership data by applying analytics to quickly identify business opportunities, create better predictability of our business and better serve our Members. 

Increasing same “store” sales.  We are committed to increasing same store sales by increasing total membership and Members’ average annual spend. We continue to enhance our omni-channel capabilities, including continued development of PriceSmart.com and our mobile shopping app for Members to use on hand-held devices. We are scaling our Click & Go™ curbside and delivery service. By applying analytics to our Member data, we can learn more about shopping patterns and Member experiences, which helps us to design targeted marketing campaigns, which can be used to further drive sales. We make ongoing investments to improve and update our clubs and are expanding sales floor space where opportunities exist in some of our high traffic clubs. We also are enhancing the “Treasure Hunt” experience by offering the best value on exclusive or one-time-buy merchandise.

Adding New Warehouse Clubs in Existing Markets. We currently operate in 13 countries/territories, with the largest in terms of population and gross domestic product being Colombia. We continue to view Colombia as an important market for growth and we view potential for growth in several of our other markets, particularly in the Northern Triangle area of Central America and in Jamaica, which is part of our Caribbean segment. We currently expect to open three warehouse clubs in fiscal year 2022 and continue to evaluate opportunities for continued expansion in these and our other existing markets. 

New Markets. While we continue to focus on opportunities to expand in Colombia, a market where our membership concept has proven to be well-received and holds significant potential to grow our business, we continue to evaluate potential opportunities for future expansion into new markets in South America.

Omni-channel Shopping and Other Services.  We are currently focusing our investment in digital transformation and omni-channel capabilities on the following strategic opportunities:

1. Convenience: Consumers increasingly are requesting home delivery or store pick up for larger items, as well as for their everyday basic shopping needs, such as consumable merchandise. We intend to continue scaling and enhancing the efficiency of our Click & Go™ curbside pickup and delivery service, which includes products ranging from fresh groceries to large appliances, in all of our markets.

2. Cross-border shopping: Using the sourcing expertise and buying power of PriceSmart, we intend to extend the range of products that our Members can purchase online beyond those products that we traditionally offer in the club. Our e-commerce platform also facilitates our ability to use smaller format clubs to expand our membership base and geographic reach in existing markets.

3. Additional communication channels and solutions for Members: In fiscal 2022, we expect to launch a new version of our mobile application, which will allow our Members to buy all of our merchandise directly in the app and also facilitate communication via push notifications. Furthermore, we will continue to expand our digital product assortment and payment options to better serve our business Members.

Supply Chain Optimization. We continue to identify and secure strategic locations throughout our markets to distribute product more efficiently and support delivery of e-commerce orders.






Distribution Efficiency

Since our inception, we have consistently believed that distribution efficiency is fundamental for success in selling merchandise in our traditional clubs, and in today’s world, this principle holds true for purchases made online.  Because PriceSmart sources merchandise from all over the world and especially in the United States, and because we are doing business in countries where infrastructure—roads and ports—is not as developed as in the United States, distribution efficiency is even more significant for us.  Our ability to move products efficiently and in a timely manner from the suppliers to our Members is key to the cost structure of our business and, consequentially, to how low we can price our products for our Members. 

Historically, our international suppliers and especially our U.S. suppliers have generally shipped their products to our Miami distribution facility where they are received and assigned to various containers for direct shipment to our locations.  Regional and in-country suppliers have shipped directly to our locations.  As our location sales volumes have grown, we have begun to route more of our products from both international, regional and local suppliers to major regional distribution centers in order to improve in-stocks, reduce inventory weeks of supply and reduce expense inefficiencies and improve working capital, all with the goal of giving better prices to our Members.

In addition to our Miami distribution facility, we have a large regional distribution center located in the metropolitan area of San Jose, Costa Rica. This 165,000 square foot building is designed to receive, store and ship dry, refrigerated and frozen products to clubs in Central America. This regional distribution center has the capacity to ship products such as major appliances and online products directly to our Members or to convenient pick-up locations, including our clubs.  We are considering other strategic locations for distribution centers to drive efficiencies and expand omni-channel offerings.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have encountered numerous supply-chain challenges, including but not limited to, container shortages, port backlogs, and trucking and shipping availability. Our expanded network of distribution centers has allowed for more alternative routings of shipments, increased throughput, and flexibility to be able to more effectively mitigate these challenges. Refer to Part II. “Item 7. Management’s Discussion & Analysis – Factors Affecting Our Business” for further discussion regarding these challenges and our efforts to mitigate them. 

Lastly, as part of our efforts to source additional high quality and healthy fresh products, and expand on our Direct Farm Program, we operate two produce distribution centers. We believe that our Direct Farm Program reduces expenses, waste and prices on items of higher quality, while simultaneously supporting local farmers and industry. Our produce distribution centers allow us to get high-quality produce from farm-to-table quicker and more efficiently. We expect to continue to expand this program and build additional produce distribution centers in more of our markets. 

Operating Efficiency

As with distribution efficiency, operating efficiency is a key tenet of our business model. We are constantly seeking to improve operating efficiencies, by investing in technology and by centralizing back-office capabilities and facilities for processing and producing products, such as meat and bakery. 
Our Membership Policy

We offer three types of memberships: Diamond, Business and Platinum. 

The Diamond Membership is targeted at individuals and families. The annual fee for a Diamond Membership (entitling Members to two cards), in most markets is approximately $35 (excluding sales tax). In Colombia, we raised the Diamond Membership fee to 92,000 COP (excluding sales tax) in December 2020, yielding a current Membership price of approximately $24.

The Company currently offers the Platinum Membership program in all thirteen of its markets. The annual fee for a Platinum Membership in most markets is approximately $75 (excluding sales tax). The Platinum Membership provides Members with a 2% rebate on most items, up to an annual maximum of $500. In Colombia, the Platinum Membership fee is 264,000 COP (excluding sales tax), yielding a current membership price of approximately $69. Platinum Members can apply this rebate to future purchases at the warehouse club at the end of the annual membership period.  The rebate is issued annually to Platinum Members on March 1 and expires August 31.  Any rebate amount not redeemed by August 31 is recognized as breakage revenue. 

We promote Business Membership through our marketing programs by offering certain merchandise targeted primarily to businesses such as restaurants, hotels, convenience stores, offices and institutions. Business Members pay an annual membership fee of approximately $35 for a primary and secondary membership card and approximately $10 for additional add-on membership cards. Only businesses can qualify for a Business Membership.

 




Members can now sign-up and renew their memberships as well as opt for auto-renewal online.

We recognize membership income over the 12-month term of the membership.  Deferred membership income was $26.0 million and $23.1 million as of August 31, 2021 and August 31, 2020, respectively.  Our membership agreements provide that if our Members cancel their membership in the first 60 days, they will receive a full refund. After the initial 60 day period, Members may receive a refund for the prorated share of their remaining membership fee if they so request.  

Our Intellectual Property Rights

It is our policy to obtain appropriate proprietary rights protection for trademarks by filing applications for registration of eligible trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. We rely on copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our employees, consultants and suppliers and other similar measures. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. While we believe that our trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary know how have significant value, changing technology and the competitive marketplace make our future success dependent principally upon our employees’ technical competence and creative skills for continuing innovation.
Our Competition

Our international merchandising business competes with a wide range of international, regional, national and local retailers, and traditional wholesale distributors.  We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours and the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer. We also prioritize above all the safety of our Members and our employees. Some of our competitors may have greater resources, buying power and name recognition.  In the countries in which we operate, we do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators.  However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores, cash and carry, home improvement centers, electronic retailers and specialty stores, including those within Latin America that are owned and operated by large U.S. and international retailers, including Walmart, Inc. in Central America and Grupo Éxito and Cencosud in Colombia.  We have competed effectively in our markets in the past and expect to continue to do so in the future due to the unique nature of the membership warehouse club format.  We have noted that certain retailers within our markets are making investments in upgrading their locations and/or experimenting with different formats.  These actions may result in increased competition within our markets.  Further, it is possible that additional U.S. warehouse club operators may decide to enter our markets and compete more directly with us in a similar warehouse club format. We also face competition from online retailers, such as Amazon.com, Inc. in Colombia, and last-mile delivery services that serve our markets, and we expect that this type of competition will grow and intensify in the future.
Human Capital

As of August 31, 2021, we had approximately 10,400 employees. Approximately 94% of our employees were employed outside of the United States, and about 1,600 employees were represented by labor unions. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

Fundamental to our mission is the ability to attract, retain, and develop a diverse workforce representative of the countries in which we operate. We are proud to hire from the local communities where we operate, which then enhances our understanding of the legislation and operating environment of each country so we can better serve our Members. We provide our employees with competitive wages above minimum wage in each region, as well as comprehensive benefit programs, which generally include life and health insurance and post-employment savings plans. We also seek to identify opportunities to support local businesses and communities, with the goal of improving the quality of life in the countries where we operate.
Talent Development.

We believe our investment in the education, training and development of our employees contributes to the overall success of our business. We believe a focus on talent development leads to long-serving, loyal employees, which improves efficiencies in operations, thus resulting in higher quality service to our Members. We provide learning opportunities for our employees through various training courses including instructor-led internal and external programs. We also seek to promote from within, allowing us to develop the leadership strengths of our employees to provide a better overall customer experience for our Members.
Health and Safety.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to our business, communities, Members and employees. We prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees and Members by following applicable local and national government regulations at each of our warehouse clubs, offices, and distribution center locations. We implemented enhanced cleaning and sanitizing protocols and provided personal protective equipment to our employees. We engage in responsible procedures, such as contact tracing, preventative quarantining and continued paid leave. We educate our employees on safety, reinforce best practices of good hygiene, and encourage our employees to receive vaccinations as they become available and in cases where possible, we have directly purchased and provided vaccines to our employees at no cost. We have built reserve teams of employees who do not overlap with each other so that they may step in as needed allowing those who are sick to take time off. We also provide employee transportation and meals in order to offer them a safe and reliable means to work. Many of our corporate offices are open in a limited capacity, and the majority of our corporate employees have shifted, temporarily, to working remotely. We offer resources for employees working remotely, which are targeted at optimizing remote work environments and managing COVID-19 related challenges. The resources we offer include office ergonomics consulting and support for mental and emotional health and well-being.
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations

Historically, our merchandising businesses have experienced holiday retail seasonality in their markets. In addition to seasonal fluctuations, our operating results fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as a result of economic and political events in markets that we serve, the timing of holidays, weather, the timing of shipments, product mix and currency effects on the cost of U.S.-sourced products which may make these products more or less expensive in local currencies and therefore more or less affordable. Because of such fluctuations, the results of operations of any quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter. In addition, there can be no assurance that our future results will be consistent with past results or the projections of securities analysts.
