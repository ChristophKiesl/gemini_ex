ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction



Ace Global Business Acquisition Limited (“Ace”, or the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated on November 2, 2020 as a British Virgin Islands company with limited liability and incorporated for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses. The Company has neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.



On April 8, 2021, the Company consummated the initial public offering (“IPO”) of 4,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”) and one warrant (“Warrant”) entitling its holder to purchase one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit (“Proposed Offering”), generating gross proceeds of $40,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 600,000 additional Units (over and above 4,000,000 units referred to above) solely to cover over-allotments if any.



Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with our Sponsor of 280,000 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating gross proceeds of $2,800,000. On April 9, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the over-allotment units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 24,000 Private Units, generating gross proceeds of $240,000. The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that the warrants underlying the Private Units will be non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. Additionally, because the Private Units were issued in a private transaction, the initial purchasers and their permitted transferees will be allowed to exercise the warrants included in the Private Units for cash even if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not effective and receive unregistered ordinary shares. Additionally, such initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except in limited circumstances, as described in the Registration Statement) until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. Such Initial Purchasers were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the purchase of the Private Units. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.



The underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full on April 9, 2021. The sale of 600,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $6,000,000.



A total of $46,920,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the over-allotment option units) and the private placements on April 8, 2021 and April 9, 2021, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders at Morgan Stanley maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination within the required time period or our entry into liquidation if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period. On May 21, 2021, our ordinary shares, and warrants underlying the Units sold in our IPO began to trade separately on a voluntary basis.



Since our IPO, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates.



Management is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations, close of the Initial Public Offering and/or business combination, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Our Management Team



We will seek to capitalize on the comprehensive experience and contacts of our executive officers in consummating an initial business combination. Our management team is comprised of Eugene Wong, Chief Executive Officer, Nicholas Xue Wei Tan and our Chief Financial Officer. Our management team brings a wealth of experience in identifying, negotiating with and conducting due diligence on potential candidates for acquisition.



 Mr. Wong has had a wide range of experience both in the financial and gaming industries for over a decade. Prior to joining Whiz Partners Inc., a private equity firm in Japan and China, he worked in the financial industry, and gained expertise in mergers and acquisitions as well as investments. During his time at Whiz Partners, he became the Chief Investment Officer of the China Hero Fund, an incubation program to support Chinese developers to create the next blockbuster console game on PlayStation 4. China Hero Fund is an exclusive collaboration with Sony Interactive Entertainment, one of the largest console gaming companies in the world. He personally oversaw the injection of multiple Japanese technology companies in audio middleware, debugging and testing and graphics renderings to improve the quality of games in this program. Through his leadership and management, he successfully executed ongoing China expansion strategies for portfolio gaming companies and ensure their successful game launch, as well as plan the exit strategy maximizing investors’ returns. Having served in multiple financial roles and in the gaming industry, his insights and experience will be invaluable to complete this business combination. Mr. Wong is currently the Vice President of Whiz Partners and the Partner and Chief Investment Officer of the China Hero PJ Fund.



Mr. Tan has had extensive experience working in Southeast Asia and Greater China in the gaming and e-commerce market. He was one of the founding team members of Shopee Pte Ltd, a leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia. As Regional Operations Director of Shopee, he set up and oversaw the business operations and product development for Shopee in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan, Philippines and Malaysia. Shopee was rated as one of the “5 disruptive e-commerce startups” by Tech In Asia and awarded the “Singapore Startup of the Year” in 2015. Shopee was later acquired by Garena, a global online games developer in Singapore, which was later known as Sea Ltd. According to Bloomberg, the company was one of the world’s best-performing large-cap stocks on Wall Street as of August 5, 2020. He later served as the Director of Zhejiang Jianqiao Energy Co. Ltd, an oil and gas company that was responsible for developing the $150 million seminal crude oil terminal at Ningbo-Zhoushan Port, and then moving onto becoming the Vice President of China Mall Group. As Vice President, he oversaw the launch of the 150,000 square meter Home Africa Mall in Johannesburg. Nicholas is currently the partner of East Ocean Capital, an investment holding company that specializes in consumers and healthcare.



With a management team with experience in merger and acquisitions for blank check companies, connections to the Asian-American community in the United States, and experience in business development, we believe we can source attractive deals and find compelling investment opportunities from private and public sources to create value for shareholders. See the section titled “Management” for complete information on the experience of our officers and directors.



Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs and will allocate their time to other businesses, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). As more fully discussed in “Management — Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under the British Virgin Islands law, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.



In addition, past performance by our management team is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. Furthermore, the members of the management team may not remain with us subsequent to the consummation of a business combination.

Competitive Advantages



Status as a Publicly Listed Company



We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses. As a publicly listed company, we will offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering. We believe that target businesses will favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution than the traditional initial public offering. During an initial public offering, there are typically expenses incurred in marketing, which would be costlier than a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our shareholders (if applicable) and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with shareholders’ interests than it would as a private company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management staffs.
Strong Financial Position and Flexibility



With the funds held in our trust account, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, if a business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination.



Together with our management team, we believe we have a broad network of contacts and corporate relationship that makes us efficient at:




● | Sourcing and evaluating businesses, and
--+----------------------------------------


● | Bridging cultural differences to negotiate and execute a transaction in a timely and professional manner.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




By leveraging our management team’s industry expertise, performing disciplined due diligence, being cautious downside protection, and providing post-acquisition value-add capabilities, we believe that we will be able to acquire a target business that will achieve significant returns for investors.



Acquisition Strategy



Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to capitalize on the management team’s network and focus our search on target businesses operating in the Greater China, Japan and Southeast Asia regions. We will seek to capitalize on the comprehensive industry experience and network of our management team to help us in sourcing, identifying, structuring and consummating the initial business combination. Our selection process will leverage our management team’s broad network of contacts and relationships with various unaffiliated sources including government bodies, investment bankers, investment professionals at private equity firms, other financial sponsors, owners of private businesses, consultants, accounting and legal firms etc. to provide us with a strong pipeline of potential acquisition leads.

Business Combination Criteria



The focus of our management team is to create shareholder value by leveraging its experience to improve the efficiency of the business while implementing strategies to grow revenue and profits organically and/or through business combinations. We have utilized, and in the event that the Business Combination (as defined below) is not consummated, will continue to utilize, the network and industry experience of our management team and their affiliates in seeking an initial business combination and employing our business combination strategy. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and their affiliates have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities.



Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see fit to do so:




● | Target companies with significant operations in Greater China, East Asia and South Asia regions
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We intend to leverage our management team’s unique expertise and relationships to source a potential target. Based on our management team’s past experience and strong network in Asia, we believe it will be advantageous to focus on finding investment opportunities in this region.




● | Industry leadership and with middle-market growth business
--+-----------------------------------------------------------




We intend to seek a target company that has a leading presence across a sector or has prominent technology or product competences. We will primarily seek to acquire a target company of mid-market range with a total enterprise value of between $150,000,000 and $300,000,000.




● | Current and potential capacity for revenue and earnings growth
--+---------------------------------------------------------------




We expect to target companies that have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of improved production capacity, cost reduction and synergistic follow-on acquisitions, which could result in an operating leverage for stronger revenue and earnings growth in the future.



These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. We used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating business combination opportunities, including the Business Combination discussed below. Based on our evaluation of DDC (as defined below) and the industry in which it operates, including the financial and other information provided by DDC in the course of negotiations, we believe that DDC meets the criteria and guidelines listed above. In the event the Business Combination is not consummated, we may decide to enter into an alternative business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.



Competitive Weaknesses



We believe our competitive weaknesses to be the following:



Limited Financial Resources



Our financial reserves will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of venture capital firms, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. In addition, our financial resources could be reduced because of our obligation to convert shares held by our public shareholders as well as any tender offer we conduct.



Lack of experience with blank check companies



Our management team is not experienced in pursuing business combinations on behalf of blank check companies. Other blank check companies may be sponsored and managed by individuals with prior experience in completing business combinations between blank check companies and target businesses. Our managements’ lack of experience may not be viewed favorably by target businesses.



Limited technical and human resources



As a blank check company, we have limited technical and human resources. Many venture capital funds, leveraged buyout firms and operating businesses possess greater technical and human resources than we do and thus we may be at a disadvantage when competing with them for target businesses.



Delay associated with shareholder approval or tender offer



We may be required to seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination. If we are not required to obtain shareholder approval of an initial business combination, we will allow our shareholders to sell their shares to us pursuant to a tender offer. Both seeking shareholder approval and conducting a tender offer will delay the consummation of our initial business combination. Other companies competing with us for acquisition opportunities may not be subject to similar requirement, or may be able to satisfy such requirements more quickly than we can. As a result, we may be at a disadvantage in competing for these opportunities.

Initial Business Combination



On August 23, 2021, we entered into the Share Exchange Agreement (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with DDC Enterprise Limited (“DDC”) and Ka Yin Norma Chu, as representative of DDC’s shareholders (the “Shareholders’ Representative”) (the transaction being referred to herein as the “Business Combination”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, among other things, the Company will acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding securities of DDC in exchange for 30,000,000 ordinary shares of the Company, of which 3,000000 ordinary shares are to be issued and held in escrow to satisfy indemnification obligations of DDC and DDC’s current shareholders.



DDC is a leading China-based Business to Business (“B2B”) and Business-to-Consumer (“B2C”) content streaming and product marketplace offering easy, convenient ready-to-cook (“RTC”) and ready-to-heat (“RTH”) meals while promoting healthier lifestyle choices to its predominately Millennial and Generation Z customer base.



Other than as specifically discussed, this Report does not give effect to the Business Combination.



Share Exchange Agreement 



Subject to the terms and conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement (including certain adjustments pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement and the ancillary agreements), at the closing, the aggregate consideration to be paid by the Company to the DDC shareholders will be thirty million (30,000,000) ordinary shares of the Company (“Ordinary Shares”), valued at $10.00 per share (the “Purchase Price”). Additionally, certain management members of DDC will have the contingent right to receive additional earnout consideration from the Company representing, in the aggregate, up to three million six hundred thousand (3,600,000) Ordinary Shares. The payment of this additional earnout consideration will be contingent on DDC attaining certain revenue thresholds in each of 2021, 2022 and 2023, and on the per-share trading price of the Ordinary Shares between the date on which the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement occurs (the “Closing”) and December 31, 2025.
Escrow Shares



At the Closing, the Company will place ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price, or three million (3,000,000) Ordinary Shares, into escrow (the “Escrow Shares”), which shall be used to pay for any losses suffered by the Company, each of its affiliates, and each of its and their respective members, managers, partners, directors, officers, employees, shareholders, attorneys and agents and permitted assigns as a result of or in connection with, among other things, any breach, inaccuracy or nonfulfillment of any of the representations and warranties of DDC contained in the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Indemnity Obligations”). One (1) year after Closing, the Escrow Shares that remain in escrow (i) after payment of any Indemnify Obligation or (ii) in connection with any still pending indemnity claim shall be distributed by the Shareholders’ Representative to the DDC shareholders, pro rata based on each such shareholder’s percentage of ownership in DDC immediately prior to Closing. Any payment of Escrow Shares to the Company or any other Company indemnitee will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.
Earnout Shares



Subject to terms and conditions set forth in the Share Exchange Agreement, the individuals that comprise the management team of DDC immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination (“DDC Management”) have the contingent right to receive additional earnout consideration from the Company representing, in the aggregate, three million six hundred thousand (3,600,000) Ordinary Shares (the “Earnout Shares”). In the event that DDC’s revenue exceeds (i) forty-one million dollars ($41,000,000) for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, then DDC Management shall receive one million (1,000,000) Earnout Shares; (ii) sixty-six million dollars ($66,000,000) for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, then DDC Management shall receive one million (1,000,000) Earnout Shares; and (iii) one hundred eighteen million dollars ($118,000,000) for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, then DDC Management shall receive one million (1,000,000) Earnout Shares. The attainment of the foregoing revenue targets will be determined by the audited financial statement of DDC for each applicable fiscal year. In addition, in the event that the volume weighted-average per-share trading price of Ordinary Shares is at or above eighteen dollars ($18.00) per share for twenty (20) consecutive trading days in any twenty (20)-day continuous trading period starting on the day of Closing and ending on December 31, 2025, then DDC Management shall receive six hundred thousand (600,000) Earnout Shares.
At the Closing 




● | The Company’s public shareholders will own approximately 11.7% of the combined company’s shares and 11.7% of the voting power of the combined company; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The private investment financing investors (the “PIPE Investors”) will own approximately 8.9% of the combined company’s shares and 8.9% of the voting power of the combined company; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Sponsor and current Company directors will own approximately 3.2% of the combined company’s shares and 3.2% of the voting power of the combined company; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The existing DDC shareholders will own approximately 76.2% of the combined company’s shares and 76.2% of the voting power in the combined company. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The levels of ownership interests were calculated based on the assumptions that (i) no Company shareholder exercises its redemption rights or dissenters’ rights, (ii) none of the initial shareholders or DDC’s current shareholders purchase Company shares in the open market, (iii) there is no exercise or conversion of ACBA Warrants, (iv) an aggregate of 3,500,000 shares are issued to the PIPE Investors at the closing of the Business Combination, (v) DDC shall buy back 200,000 Ordinary Shares from Ace Global Investment Limited at $10 per share on the consummation of the Business Combination using the excess funds in the Trust Account, which shall be subsequently cancelled or held in treasury, and (vi) there are no other issuances of equity by the Company prior to or in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination. The foregoing also excludes up to 3,600,000 Earnout Shares that will be issuable to DDC Management pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement. When including the Earnout Shares, the Company’s public shareholders’ voting power will be diluted to approximately 10.7% of the combined company.



Business Strategy and Deal Origination



Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, build a company in the consumer or consumer-related products and services industries that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from their operational expertise. Our business combination strategy leverages our management team’s network of potential proprietary and public transaction sources where we believe a combination of our relationships, knowledge and experience in the consumer and consumer-related products and services industries could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses to improve their overall value proposition.



We have utilized, and in the event that the Business Combination is not consummated, will continue to utilize, the network and industry experience of the Company’s management team and their affiliates in seeking an initial business combination and employing our business combination strategy. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and their affiliates have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of acquisition opportunities.



We expect that, in the event that the Business Combination is not consummated, these networks will continue to provide our management team with a robust flow of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will continue to be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, which may include investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises.



Effecting a Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time following our initial public offering. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of private units, our share capital, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of private units are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination as described in this report, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. Accordingly, investors are investing without first having an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any one or more business combinations. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various U.S. Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.
Sources of Target Businesses



We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings which will not commence until after the completion of this offering. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their respective affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, in the event that the Business Combination is not consummated, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will any of our existing officers, directors, special advisors or initial shareholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination (regardless of the type of transaction). If we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our officers, directors or initial shareholders, we will do so only if we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view. However, as of the date of this report, there is no affiliated entity that we consider a business combination target.

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business, should the Business Combination not be consummated. We have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:




● | financial condition and results of operation;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | growth potential;
--+------------------


● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


● | competitive position;
--+----------------------


● | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


● | stage of development of its products, processes or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection for its products, processes or services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulatory environment of the industry; and
--+--------------------------------------------


● | costs associated with effecting the business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------




We believe such factors will be important in evaluating prospective target businesses, regardless of the location or industry in which such target business operates. However, this list is not intended to be exhaustive. We used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating business combination opportunities, including with DDC. Based on our evaluation of DDC and the industry in which it operates, including the financial and other information provided by DDC in the course of negotiations, we believe that DDC meets the criteria and guidelines listed above. In the event that the Business Combination is not consummated, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.



Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.



The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.

Fair Market Value of Target Business



Pursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test, assuming that we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.



We will not be required to comply with the 80% fair market value requirement if we are delisted from Nasdaq. If Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange after this offering, we would not be required to satisfy the fair market value requirement described above and could complete a business combination with a target business having a fair market value substantially below 80% of the balance in the trust account.



Lack of Business Diversification



Our business combination must be with a target business or businesses that collectively satisfy the minimum valuation standard at the time of such acquisition, as discussed above, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses at the same time. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If the Business Combination is not consummated and if we subsequently determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management



Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination



The Business Combination requires the approval of our shareholders. However, in the event that the Business Combination is not consummated, in connection with any alternative proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each shareholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction, or whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.



We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait 12 months from the closing of this offering (or 21 months if we have extended the period of time as described in this report) in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.

Our initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination. As a result, if we sought shareholder approval of a proposed transaction we could need as little as 56,251 of our public shares (or approximately 1.12% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised and the initial shareholders do not purchase any units in this offering or units or shares in the after-market).



None of our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or ordinary shares in this offering or from persons in the open market or in private transactions (other than the private units). However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial shareholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.



Ability to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination



If we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial Business Combination by April 8, 2022, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate the Business Combination three times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 21 months to complete the Business Combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account for each three month extension $455,400 for exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option ($0.099 per share in either case), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. The insiders will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the lender’s discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Our shareholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination (except that DDC agrees to fund the trust account to extend the time to January 8, 2023). In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire amount required. Any notes issued pursuant to these loans would be in addition to any notes issued pursuant to working capital loans made to us. If we are unable to consummate the Business Combination and are unable to complete an alternative initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible, but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not necessary to pay our taxes, and then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors that may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the public rights will expire and be worthless.



Conversion/Tender Rights



At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The conversion rights will be effected under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and British Virgin Islands law as redemptions. When we hold a meeting to approve the initial Business Combination (or it we hold a meeting to approve an alternative business combination), a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares.



Alternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public shareholder will be provided the opportunity to sell his public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.



Our initial shareholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to this offering or purchased by them in this offering or in the aftermarket.





10







We may also require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. Once the shares are converted by the holder, and effectively redeemed by us under British Virgin Islands law, the transfer agent will then update our Register of Members to reflect all conversions. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to shareholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we are required to provide at least 10 days’ advance notice of any shareholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a shareholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public shareholders who wish to convert their ordinary shares into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to.



There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.



Any request to convert or tender such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).



If the initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.



Automatic Liquidation of Trust Account if No Business Combination



If we do not complete a business combination within 12 months (or 21 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this report) from the consummation of this offering, it will trigger our automatic winding up, liquidation and subsequent dissolution pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. As a result, this has the same effect as if we had formally gone through a voluntary liquidation procedure under the Companies Law. Accordingly, no vote would be required from our shareholders to commence such a voluntary winding up, dissolution and liquidation. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial Business Combination by April 8, 2022, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate the Business Combination three times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 21 months to complete the Business Combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account for each three month extension $455,400 for exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option ($0.099 per share in either case), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. The insiders or their affiliates or designees will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the lender’s discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Our shareholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination (except that DDC agrees to fund the trust account to extent the time to January 8, 2023). To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable to consummate the initial Business Combination and are unable to complete an alternative business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not necessary to pay our taxes, then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders. In the event of our dissolution and liquidation, the public rights will expire and will be worthless.




11







The amount in the trust account under the Companies Law will be treated as funds distributable under the Companies Law provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, we are able to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are forced to liquidate the trust account, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way in connection with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.



Each of our initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of our trust account or other assets with respect to the insider shares and private units and to vote their insider shares, private shares in favor of any liquidation and plan of distribution which we submit to a vote of shareholders. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless.



If we are unable to consummate the Business Combination, and if we are unable to complete an alternative business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share distribution from the trust account would be $10.20.



The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would be prior to the claims of our public shareholders. Although we will seek to have all vendors, including lenders for money borrowed, prospective target businesses or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, we would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest of our shareholders if such third party refused to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management believed that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.



Ace Global Investment Limited, our Sponsor, has agreed that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, it will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of the IPO not held in the trust account, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have not executed a waiver agreement. However, we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy those obligations if it is required to do so. Accordingly, the actual per-share distribution could be less than $10.00 due to claims of creditors. Additionally, if we are deemed insolvent for the purposes of the Insolvency Act, or we are required to immediately enter insolvent liquidation, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable insolvency law, and may be included in our insolvent estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public shareholders at least $10.20 per share.



Competition



In the event we do not consummate the Business Combination, we may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours in identifying, evaluating and selecting an alternative target business, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.





12







The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:




● | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants, rights and unit purchase options and the potential future dilution they represent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions to Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. upon consummation of our initial business combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to either repay or issue units upon conversion of up to $500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.



If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.



Facilities



We maintain our principal executive office 6/F Unit B, Central 88, 88-98 Des Voeux Road Central, Central, Hong Kong. The cost for this space is provided to us by our Sponsor, as part of the $10,000 per month payment we make to it for general and administrative services, including office space, utilities and administrative services to the Company. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees



We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
