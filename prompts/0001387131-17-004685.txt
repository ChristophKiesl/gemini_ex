Product Groups and Markets 
 
In 2015, we organized our business based on five product groups: low volume precision molded optics (“LVPMO”), high volume precision molded optics (“HVPMO”), infrared products, specialty products, and non-recurring engineering (“NRE”). Our LVPMO product group consists of precision molded optics with a sales price greater than $10 per lens and is usually sold in smaller lot quantities. Our HVPMO product group consists of precision molded optics with a sales price of less than $10 per lens and is usually sold in larger lot quantities. Our infrared product group is comprised of both molded and turned lens and assemblies and includes all ISP products. Our specialty product group is comprised of value added products such as optical subsystems, assemblies, GRADIUM lenses, and isolators. Our NRE product group consists of those products we develop pursuant to product development agreements we enter into with customers. Typically, customers approach us and request that we develop new products or applications for our existing products to fit their particular needs or specifications. The timing and extent of any such product development is outside of our control.
 
We currently serve the following major markets: industrial, laser, defense, medical, telecommunications, and instrumentation. Within our product groups, we have various applications that serve these major markets. For example, our HVPMO lenses are typically used in industrial tools, especially in China. Our HVPMO and LVPMO lenses are also used in applications for the telecommunications market, such as data centers, digital video distribution, wireless broadband, and machine to machine interface, and, the laser market, such as laser tools, scientific and bench top lasers, and bar code scanners. Our infrared products can also be used in various applications within our major markets. Currently, sales of our infrared products are primarily for customers in the industrial market that use thermal imaging cameras. Our infrared products can also be used for gas sensing devices, spectrometers, night vision systems, automotive driver systems, thermal weapon gun sights, and infrared counter measure systems, among others.
 
Within the larger overall markets, which are estimated to be in the multi-billions of dollars, we believe there is a market of approximately $1.7 billion for our current products and capabilities. We continue to believe our products will provide significant growth opportunities over the next several years and, therefore, we will continue to target specific applications in each of these major markets. In addition to these major markets, a large percentage of our revenues are derived from sales to unaffiliated companies that purchase our products to fulfill their customer’s orders, as well as unaffiliated companies that offer our products for sale in their catalogs.
 
The following further discusses the various products we offer and certain growth opportunities we anticipate for each such product.
 
LVPMO and HVPMO Product Groups. Aspheric lenses are known for their optimal performance. Aspheric lenses simplify and shrink optical systems by replacing several conventional lenses. However, aspheric lenses are difficult and costly to machine. Our glass molding technology enables the production of both low and high volumes of aspheric optics while still maintaining the highest quality at an affordable price. Molding is the most consistent and economical way to produce aspheres and we have perfected this method to offer the most precise molded aspheric lenses available.
 
In recent years, sales of both our LVPMOs and HVPMOs have increased. We expect this growth to continue for the next several years with what we believe is the beginning of a multi-year growth cycle of the optical market. This multi-year growth cycle is driven by four major trends: data centers; digital video distribution; wireless broadband; and machine-to-machine interface. Cloud computing has caused a shift in enterprise technology with increased spending for software-as-a-service (“SAAS”) and infrastructure-as-a-service (“IAAS”) capital investments. Delivery of applications and technology using SAAS or IAAS requires larger and faster network bandwidth. The explosion of mobile devices, which includes smartphones and tablet devices, is also requiring the expansion of network bandwidth as users are receiving and transferring larger amounts of data via their mobile devices. By 2021, it is estimated that there will be 1.5 mobile devices per capita. It is also expected that there will be approximately 11.6 billion mobile-connected devices by 2021, including machine-to-machine (“M2M”) modules, exceeding the world’s projected population of 7.8 billion. Individuals are also streaming more video on their mobile devices or through their smart TVs. This type of video distribution, which is estimated to be 80% of all network traffic by 2019, is creating a huge demand for larger and faster bandwidth. Finally, machine-to-machine connection technology allows wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices of the same type. This type of networking often requires bandwidth in order for the machines to communicate with each other. All of these trends require the expansion of bandwidth, and thus, the growth of optical communication networks. Our products, such as our precision molded optical lenses, can be used as a component in optical communication networks. We also anticipate growth in our precision molded aspheres product revenues as we add new product lenses and applications for a variety of markets and industries, including laser tools, telecom transceivers, micro-projectors, scientific and bench top lasers, range finders, medical devices, bar code scanners and laser based spectrometers.
 

● | LVPMOs. The growth in our LVPMO business is driven by a variety of market applications such as medical endoscopes, medical flow cytometers, scientific and bench-top lasers, laser based spectrometers, military telecom, and telescopic weapon sights. These products have precision specifications and 100% testing to verify that our lenses conform to a higher level of performance than most of the competition in these markets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | HVPMOs. The continued growth in our HVPMO business is driven by market applications supporting mostly the laser diode applications for high volume markets in laser tools, range finders, laser gun sights, bar code scanners, and micro-projectors. The same basic tooling used for high precision in the LVPMO applications allows us to realize a competitive advantage for high volume production that benefits the end customer while maintaining low price targets. Markets for laser diode applications are expected to grow substantially in the next few years as applications such as Lidar, which uses light and radar for distance tracking and speed detection, headlights for automobiles, and many other related disciplines begin to rely more and more on laser technology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Infrared Product Group. Advances in chalcogenide materials have enabled compression molding for mid-wavelength infrared (“MWIR”) and long-wavelength infrared (“LWIR”) optics in a process similar to precision molded lenses. Our molded infrared optics technology enables high performance, cost-effective infrared aspheric lenses that do not rely on traditional diamond turning or lengthy polishing methods. Utilizing precision molded aspheric optics significantly reduces the number of lenses required for typical thermal imaging systems and the cost to manufacture these lenses. Molding is an excellent alternative to traditional lens processing methods particularly where volume and repeatability is required.
 
Through our subsidiary ISP we also offer germanium, silicon or zinc selenide aspheres and spherical lenses which are manufactured by diamond turning. This manufacturing technique allows us to offer larger lens sizes and the ability to use other optical materials which cannot be effectively molded. As some complex optical challenges demand more exotic optical substrate materials that are non-moldable, the integration of ISP allows Lightpath the ability to meet these demands.
 
Overall, we anticipate growth for infrared optics and increased requirements for systems requiring aspheric optics. Infrared systems, which include thermal imaging cameras, gas sensing devices, spectrometers, night vision systems, automotive driver awareness systems such as blind spot detection, thermal weapon sights, and infrared counter measure systems, represent a market that is forecasted to grow from $6.4 billion in 2015 to $11.4 billion by 2022, at a compound annual growth rate of 8.32% between 2016 and 2022. As infrared imaging systems become widely available, the cost of optical components needs to decrease before the market demand will increase. Our aspheric molding process is an enabling technology for the cost reduction and commercialization of infrared imaging systems because the aspheric shape of our lenses enables system designers to reduce the lens element in a system and provide similar performance at a lower cost.
 
Specialty Product Group. We have a rapidly growing group of specialty products and assemblies that take advantage of our unique technologies and capabilities. These products include custom optical designs, mounted lenses, optical assemblies, and GRADIUM lenses. We expect growth from defense communications programs and commercial optical sub-assemblies.
 
Our GRADIUM glass is an optical quality glass material with axially varying refractive index, capable of reducing optical aberrations inherent in conventional lenses and performing with a single lens tasks traditionally performed by multi-element, conventional lens systems. Typical applications include surgical lasers, high power YAG lasers for welding, cutting and marking, defense-market uses, and test and measurement. GRADIUM has a unique capability to handle up to 10 kilowatts of power and is servicing a niche market for laser high-power cutting and laser welding.
 
We design, build, and sell optical assemblies into markets for test and measurement, medical devices, military, industrial, and communications based on our proprietary technologies. Many of our optical assemblies consist of several products that we manufacture.
 
Our strategy is to leverage our technology, know-how, established low cost manufacturing capability and partnerships to grow our business. We plan to accomplish this growth through the implementation of the following objectives:
 

● | Leverage our Leadership to Drive Organic Growth. We plan to continue to capitalize on our global operations network, distribution infrastructure, and technology to pursue global growth. We will focus our efforts on those geographic areas and end products that we believe offer the most attractive growth and long-term profit prospects.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Focus on Cash Flow Generation. Our goal is to focus on cash flow generation and return on invested capital through the continuing optimization of our cost structure, improvement in working capital and supply chain efficiencies, and a disciplined approach to capital expenditures. We have a proven track record of mitigating fixed cost inflation with cost saving actions and productivity improvements. We intend to continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities based in large part on benchmarks of industry-leading performance and productivity improvements by utilizing our engineering and manufacturing technology expertise and partnerships with low cost producers. Our goal is to maintain a cost structure that positions us favorably to compete and grow. We intend to continue to upgrade our customer and product mix by adding products that move up the supply chain by offering assemblies that use our lenses, thereby increasing our sales of value-added, differentiated products, and achieving premium pricing to improve margins and enhance cash flow.

● | Increase Customer Base and Continue to Develop New Products. A key component of our strategy is to produce innovative, high-performance products that offer enhanced value propositions to our customers at competitive prices. Our goal is to continually work closely with our customers to provide solutions and productions that optimize their products. This market-driven product development enables us to offer a high-quality product portfolio to our customers and provide our business with the ability to respond quickly and efficiently to changes in market demands.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Deepen Our Presence in Emerging Markets. Emerging markets are a strategic priority for our business. We are well positioned not only to leverage our strong market positions in mature but highly sophisticated markets in North America and Europe, but also to participate in the expected growth of emerging markets in Asia and Eastern Europe. We believe that improving living standards and growth in GDP across emerging markets are combining to create increased demand for our products. We expect to capitalize on this growth opportunity by expanding our customer base and local capabilities in order to increase our market share across emerging markets, especially in China. To accelerate our penetration of these markets and maintain our competitive cost position, we may develop relationships with leading local partners, especially in businesses where participation in the fast-growing Chinese market is particularly important for long-term sustainable growth. For example, we are well positioned to leverage our strong production technology in the Chinese market as a result of an increasing percentage of aerospace, automotive, semiconductor, electronics, and telecommunications manufacturing transitioning to China.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continue to Drive Operational Excellence and Asset Efficiency. Operational excellence, which includes a commitment to safety, environmental stewardship, and improved reliability, is key to our future success. We continually evaluate our business to identify opportunities to increase operational efficiency throughout our production facilities with a focus on maintaining operational excellence, reducing costs, and maximizing asset efficiency. We intend to continue focusing on increasing manufacturing efficiencies through selected capital projects, process improvements, and best practices in order to lower unit costs. We will also carefully manage our portfolio and take appropriate actions to address product lines that face challenging market conditions and do not generate returns on invested capital that we believe are sufficient to create long-term shareholder value.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drive Organizational Alignment. We believe that maintaining alignment of the efforts of our employees with our overall business strategy and operational excellence goals is critical to our success. We have outstanding people and assets and, with the commitment to values of safety, customer appreciation, simplicity, collective entrepreneurship, and integrity, we believe that we can maintain our competitiveness and help achieve our operational excellence and asset efficiency strategic objectives.

Sales and Marketing
 
Marketing. Extensive product diversity and varying levels of product maturity characterize the optics industry. Product markets range from consumer (e.g., cameras, copiers) to industrial (e.g., lasers, data storage, infrared imaging), from products where the lenses are the central feature (e.g., telescopes, microscopes, lens systems) to products incorporating lens components (e.g., robotics, semiconductor production equipment) and communications (e.g., various optics are required for bandwidth expansion and improved data transfer for the optical network). As a result, we market our products across a wide variety of customer groups including laser systems manufacturers, laser OEMs, infrared-imaging systems vendors, industrial laser tool manufacturers, telecommunications equipment manufacturers, medical and industrial measurement equipment manufacturers, government defense agencies, and research institutions worldwide.
Technical Sales Model. To align the organization for specific goals and accountability, we created an executive structure with three direct reporting lines: Operations, Sales and Marketing, and Finance. Our Sales and Marketing organization is led by the Vice President of Corporate Business Development, as well as our Executive Sales Manager and Marketing Manager. We also combined the organizations supporting our aspheric visible lens products and our infrared products.
 
Sales Team & Channel. We have regional sales forces that market and sell our products directly to customers in North America, Europe and China. We also have a master distributor in Europe. We have formalized relationships with 14 industrial, laser, and optoelectronics distributors and channel partners located in the United States and various foreign countries to assist in the distribution of our products in highly specific target markets. We also have reseller arrangements with the top three product catalog companies in the optics and opto-electronics market. In addition, we also maintain our own product catalog and internet website (www.lightpath.com) as vehicles for broader promotion of our products. We make use of print media advertisements in various trade magazines and participate in appropriate domestic and foreign trade shows.
 
All of our partners work diligently to expand opportunities in emerging geographic markets and through alternate channels of distribution. We believe that we provide a high level of support in developing and maintaining our long-term relationships with our customers. Customer service and support are provided through our offices and those of our partners that are located throughout the world.

Trade Shows. We display our product line additions and enhancements at one or more trade shows each year. For example, we participated in several United States based shows including Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers (“SPIE”) Photonics West in January 2017 and SPIE Defense, Security and Sensing in April 2017. We also participate in shows in China such as the China International Optoelectronic Exposition in Shenzhen. In addition, we partner with key distributors to attend exhibitions such as Laser World of Photonics in Munich, Germany. This strategy underscores our strategic directive of broadening our base of innovative optical components and assemblies. These trade shows also provide an opportunity to meet with and enhance existing business relationships, meet and develop potential customers, and to distribute information and samples regarding our products.
Competition
 
The market for optical components generally is highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with manufacturers of conventional spherical lenses and optical components, providers of aspheric lenses and optical components, and producers of optical quality glass. To a lesser extent, we compete with developers of specialty optical components and assemblies. Many of these competitors have greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, and other resources than we do.
 
We believe our unique capabilities in optical design engineering, our low cost structure and our substantial presence in Europe and Asia, particularly in China, provides us with a competitive edge and assists us in securing business. Additionally, we believe that we offer value to some customers as a second or backup supply source in the United States should they be unwilling to commit to purchase their entire supply of a critical component from a foreign production source. We also have a broad product offering to satisfy a variety of applications and markets.
 
LVPMOs and HVPMOs Product Groups. Our LVPMO products compete with conventional lenses and optical components manufactured by companies such as Asia Optical, Anteryon, RPO, and Sunny Optics.
 
Aspheric lenses compete with lens systems comprised of multiple conventional lenses. Machined aspheric lenses compete with our molded glass aspheric lenses, which are part of our HVPMO product group. Aspheric lens system manufacturers include Panasonic, ALP’s, Hoya Corporation, as well as newer competitors from China and Taiwan such as E-pin Optical Industry Co. and Kinik Company. The use of aspheric surfaces provides the optical designer with a powerful tool in correcting spherical aberrations and enhancing performance in state-of-the-art optical products. However, we believe that our optical design expertise and our flexibility in providing custom high performance optical components at a low price are key competitive advantages for us over these competitors.
 
Plastic molded aspheres and hybrid plastic/glass aspheric optics, on the other hand, allow for high volume production, but primarily are limited to low cost consumer products that do not place a high demand on performance (such as plastic lenses in disposable or mobile phone cameras). Molded plastic aspheres appear in products that stress cost or weight as their measure of success over performance and durability. Our low cost structure allows us to compete with these lenses based on higher performance and durability from our glass lenses at only a small premium in price over plastic or plastic/glass hybrid lenses.
 
Infrared Product Group. Our infrared aspheric optics compete with optical products produced by Janos Technologies, Ophir Optics, Elcan Optical Technologies, Clear Align and a variety of Eastern European and Asian manufacturers. These traditional infrared lenses can either be polished spherical or are diamond turned aspherical. Our molded lenses compete with spherical lenses because like all aspheres they can replace doublets or triplets based on the higher performance of an aspheric lens. Diamond turned aspheres from germanium are more expensive to produce in high volumes and time consuming to manufacture. We believe our low cost, high volume lens business technology combined with our newly acquired traditional polishing and diamond turning capabilities enables us to compete with the other manufacturers of traditional infrared lens by offering the best technology fit at the best price for the mission.
 
Our molded infrared optics competes with products manufactured by Umicore, RPO, Kiro, and Free Form. We believe that our optical design expertise, our diverse manufacturing flexibility and our manufacturing facilities located in Asia, Europe and North America are key advantages over the products manufactured by these competitors. A specific advantage over Umicore, a foreign company, is that the infrared market is highly dependent on the United States defense industry, which prefers to purchase from United States based companies such as LightPath.
 
Specialty Product Group. GRADIUM lenses are often used for products in the niche high power laser optics market. GRADIUM lenses are produced using a unique, well-established technology that no other manufacturer possesses, which provides us with a competitive advantage. However, there are other competing technologies, such as traditional fused silica doublets and triplets, as well as newer large diameter aspheres, such as those manufactured by Asphericon or Edmund Optics.
Manufacturing
 
Facilities. Our manufacturing is largely performed in our 26,000 square foot production facility in Orlando, Florida, in LPOIZ’s 26,000 square foot production facility in Zhenjiang, China and in ISP Latvia’s 23,000 square foot production facility in Riga, Latvia. In October 2015, LPOI moved its sales and support functions to a 1,900 square foot facility in Shanghai. ISP also has an approximately 13,000 square foot facility in Irvington, New York that functions as its operations headquarters, providing manufacturing capabilities, optical coatings, optical and mechanical design, assembly and testing, as well as some engineering, administrative and sales functions.

The Zhenjiang facility has anti-reflective coating equipment to coat our lenses in-house. ISP’s Irvington facility and ISP Latvia’s Riga facility include fully vertically integrated manufacturing processes to produce high precision infrared lenses and infrared lens assemblies, including crystal growth, CNC grinding, conventional polishing, diamond turning, multilayer coatings, assemblies and state of the art metrology. ISP’s Irvington facility and ISP Latvia’s Riga facility include fully vertically integrated manufacturing processes to produce high precision infrared lenses and infrared lens assemblies, including crystal growth, CNC grinding, conventional polishing, diamond turning, multilayer coatings, assemblies and state of the art metrology.
 
We are in the process of adding additional production equipment at our Orlando, Zhenjiang and Riga facilities. In July 2017, we entered into a lease for an additional 13,000 square feet in the Zhenjiang facility. We also intend to add additional work shifts at the Zhenjiang facility, as needed, to increase capacity and meet forecasted demand. Our Irvington facility is at capacity with limited room for growth; however, additional expansion is not expected for this facility. Our Riga facility recently underwent an expansion of approximately 4,000 square feet, which is expected to handle our short-term growth based on our forecasted demand. We intend to monitor the capacity at our facilities, and will increase such space as needed. We believe our facilities are adequate to accommodate our needs over the next year.


Production and Equipment. Our Orlando facility contains a manufacturing area for our molded glass aspheres, a tooling and machine shop to support new product development, commercial production requirements for our machined parts, the fabrication of proprietary press work stations and mold equipment, and a clean room for our molding and assembly workstations. We also have glass coring equipment to meet our current needs of GRADIUM product sales worldwide. LPOIZ’s Zhenjiang facility features a molded glass aspheres manufacturing area, clean room, machine shop, and an area for anti-reflective coating.
 
ISP’s Irvington facility contains a manufacturing area for diamond turning, coating, lens assembly, quality control, as well as an area for research and development. The facility is equipped with numerous diamond turning machines and accompanying metrology equipment, offering full scale diamond turning capabilities.

The Zhenjiang facility also recently obtained ISO/TS 1649:2009 certification for manufacturing of optical lenses and accessories used in automobiles. The Orlando and Irvington facilities are also International Traffic in Arms and Regulation (“ITAR”) compliant. For more information regarding our facilities, please see Item 2. Properties in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Subcontractors and Strategic Alliances. We believe that low-cost manufacturing is crucial to our long-term success. In that regard, we generally use subcontractors in our production process to accomplish certain processing steps requiring specialized capabilities. For example, we presently use a number of qualified subcontractors for fabricating, polishing, and coating certain lenses as necessary. We have taken steps to protect our proprietary methods of repeatable high quality manufacturing by patent disclosures and internal trade secret controls.
Suppliers. We utilize a number of glass compositions in manufacturing our molded glass aspheres and lens array products. These glasses or equivalents are available from a large number of suppliers, including CDGM Glass Company Ltd., Ohara Corporation, and Sumita Optical Glass, Inc. Base optical materials, used in both GRADIUM and collimator products, are manufactured and supplied by a number of optical and glass manufacturers. ISP utilizes major infrared material suppliers located around the globe for a broad spectrum of infrared crystal and glass. We believe that a satisfactory supply of such production materials will continue to be available at reasonable prices, although there can be no assurance in this regard.

We also rely on local and regional vendors for component materials and services such as housings, fixtures, magnets, chemicals and inert gases, specialty ceramics, UV and AR coatings, and other specialty coatings. In addition, certain products require external processing such as anodizing and metallization. To date, we are not dependent on any of these manufacturers and have found a suitable number of qualified vendors and suppliers for these materials and services.
 
We currently purchase a few key materials from single or limited sources. We believe that a satisfactory supply of production materials will continue to be available at competitive prices, although there can be no assurance in this regard.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our policy is to protect our technology by, among other things, patents, trade secret protection, trademarks, and copyrights. We primarily rely upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how to protect certain process inventions, lens designs and innovations. For example, a key feature of GRADIUM glass is that, once fabricated, it does not reveal our formula upon inspection and, to our knowledge, cannot be reverse-engineered. We have taken security measures to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, to the extent possible.
 
In addition to trade secrets and proprietary know-how, we have three remaining patents that relate to the fusing of certain of our lenses that are part of our specialty products group. These patents expire at various times through 2023.
 
Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to ours or that compete with ours. Patent, trademark, and trade secret laws afford only limited protection for our technology and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable, if the design around is favorably received in the marketplace. In addition, if any of our products or technology is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation, or other claims.
 
We own several registered and unregistered service marks and trademarks that are used in the marketing and sale of our products. The following table sets forth our registered and unregistered service marks and trademarks, if registered, the country in which the mark is filed, and the renewal date for such mark.

Environmental and Governmental Regulation
 
Currently, emissions, and waste from our manufacturing processes are at such low levels that no special environmental permits or licenses are required. In the future, we may need to obtain special permits for disposal of increased waste by-products. The glass materials we utilize contain some toxic elements in a stabilized molecular form. However, the high temperature diffusion process results in low-level emissions of such elements in gaseous form. If production reaches a certain level, we believe that we will be able to efficiently recycle certain of our raw material waste, thereby reducing disposal levels. We believe that we are presently in compliance with all material federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing our operations and have obtained all material licenses and permits necessary for the operation of our business.
 
We also utilize certain chemicals, solvents, and adhesives in our manufacturing process. We believe we maintain all necessary permits and are in full compliance with all applicable regulations.

To our knowledge there are currently no United States federal, state or local regulations that restrict the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Certain end-user applications require government approval of the complete optical system, such as United States Food and Drug Administration approval for use in endoscopy. In these cases, we will generally be involved on a secondary level and our OEM customer will be responsible for the license and approval process.
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict minerals” mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. The conflict minerals include tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, and their derivatives. Pursuant to these requirements, we are required to report on Form SD the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. We strive to only use suppliers that source from conflict-free smelters and refiners; however, in the future, we may face difficulties in gathering information regarding our suppliers and the source of any such conflict minerals.
 
New Product Development
 
For many years, we engaged in basic research and development that resulted in the invention of GRADIUM glass and certain proprietary processes for fabricating GRADIUM glass lenses. Thereafter, our new product development efforts led to the development of our capabilities in molded aspheric lenses and infrared lenses. We incurred expenditures for new product development during fiscal 2017 and 2016 of approximately $1.2 million and $669,000, respectively. We concentrated our efforts to support existing and new customers in the design and manufacture of items in three of our product lines: HVPMO lenses, LVPMO lenses and infrared products.
 
In fiscal 2018, we anticipate focusing our new product development efforts on infrared optics products for imaging and sensing, fiber lasers, spectrophotometry, defense, medical devices, industrial, optical data storage, machine vision, sensors, and environmental monitoring. In addition, we plan on continuing to invest in designing and developing the next generation of our proprietary precision glass molding machines. We currently plan to expend approximately $1.2 million for new product development during fiscal 2018, which could vary depending upon revenue levels, customer requirements, and perceived market opportunities.
 
For more difficult or customized products, we bill our customers for engineering services as a non-recurring engineering fee.
 
Concentration of Customer Risk
 
In fiscal 2017, we had sales to three customers that comprised an aggregate of approximately 26% of our annual revenue with one customer at 10% of our sales, another customer at 9% of our sales and the third customer at 7% of our sales. In fiscal 2016, we had sales to three customers that comprised an aggregate of approximately 25% of our annual revenue with one customer at 10% of our sales, another customer at 8% of our sales and the third customer at 7% of our sales. The loss of any of these customers, or a significant reduction in sales to any such customer, would adversely affect our revenues. We continue to diversify our business in order to minimize our sales concentration risk.
 
In fiscal 2017, 61% of our net revenue was derived from sales outside of the United States, with 88% of our foreign sales derived from customers in Europe and Asia.
 
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2017, we had 321 employees, of which 308 were full-time equivalent employees, with 75 located in Orlando, Florida, 38 located in Irvington, New York, 73 located in Riga, Latvia, and 122 located in Jiading and Zhenjiang, China. Of our 308 full-time equivalent employees, we have 35 employees engaged in management, administrative, and clerical functions, 35 employees in new product development, 20 employees in sales and marketing, and 218 employees in production and quality control functions. Any employee additions or terminations over the next twelve months will be dependent upon the actual sales levels realized during fiscal 2018. We have used and will continue utilizing part-time help including interns, temporary employment agencies, and outside consultants, where appropriate, to qualify prospective employees and to ramp up production as required from time to time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
