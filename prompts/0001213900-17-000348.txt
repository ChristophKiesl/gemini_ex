Item 1. Business
Corporate Overview
 
We are currently a “shell company” with no meaningful assets or operations other than our efforts to identify and merge with an operating company.
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 13, 2012. Our current business office is located at Xusheng Building, Yintian Road, Bo’an District, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, People’s Republic of China. Our telephone number is 86-0755 83695082.
 
Our limited business until October 13, 2016, when control of our company changed (“Change of Control”) pursuant to a share purchase agreement and a spin-off agreement set forth below (respectively “Change of Control SPA” and the “Spin-Off Agreement”), was computer game development. On October 26, 2016, our corporate name was changed from “Steampunk Wizards, Inc.” to "Tianci International, Inc." The name change was effected on November 27, 2016, pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes Section 92A.180 (the “Name Change”), in connection with the merger of us into our then subsidiary, Tianci International Inc. (the “Statutory Merger”)
 
We are now exploring business combination opportunities with existing business.
 
Current Business 
 
Based on proposed business activities, we are a “blank check” company. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements.
 
Our principal business is to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s officers. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have not entered into any agreement with any party regarding acquisition opportunities for us. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

● | Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
● | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
● | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds from the Registrant, from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 
● | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
● | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and 
● | Other relevant factors. 

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available acquisition opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. We may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the business to be acquired. In addition, we will be competing against other entities that possess greater financial, technical and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing business combinations. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information that may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources.

We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business’s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our lack of funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or other associated with the target business seeking our participation.
 
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.
 
Additionally, we are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination.
 
Historical Activities
 
2014 Sale
 In January 2014, we were a party to a securities purchase agreement (the "2014 SPA") by and among ourselves, certain of our shareholders (the "Selling Shareholders") owning an aggregate of 27,000,000 shares (approximately 51.7%) of our common stock (the "Sold Stock") and Anton Lin ("Lin").  Pursuant to the 2014 SPA, Lin purchased the Sold Stock for $27,000 (the "Purchase Price") from the Selling Shareholders in a private sale transaction (the "Private Sale"). The Selling Shareholders were our former sole officer and director: Thomas Hynes ("Hynes") and corporate secretary: Nina Bijedic ("Bijedic").  Pursuant to the 2014 SPA, Hynes and Bijedic submitted their resignations from all positions held with us; prior to the closing of the Private Sale, our Board of Directors appointed Lin as our sole director and Chief Executive Officer, which appointment took effect immediately following the close of the Private Sale.  Following the Private Sale, a change in control occurred since Lin gained control of almost 52% of our outstanding common stock.
2015 Share Exchange
 On July 15, 2015, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Steampunk Wizards Ltd., a company incorporated pursuant to the laws of Malta (“Malta Co.”), Lin, being the owner of record of 11,451,541 common shares of us and the persons listed thereof (the “Shareholders”), being the owners of record of all of the issued share capital of Malta Co. (the “Steampunk Stock”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, upon surrender by the Shareholders and the cancellation by Malta Co. of the certificates evidencing the Steampunk Stock as registered in the name of each Shareholder, and pursuant to the registration of us in the register of members maintained by Malta Co. as the new holder of the Steampunk Stock and the issuance of the certificates evidencing the aforementioned registration of the Steampunk Stock in the name of us, on August 21, 2015, we issued 4,812,209 shares (the “New Shares”) (subject to adjustment for fractionalized shares as set forth below) of our common stock to the Shareholders (or their designees), and Lin caused 10,096,229 shares of our common stock that he owned (the “Lin Stock,” together with the New Shares, the “Acquisition Stock”) to be transferred to the Shareholders (or their designees), which collectively represented 55% of the issued and outstanding common stock of us immediately after the Closing, in exchange for the Steampunk Stock, representing 100% of the issued share capital of Malta Co. As a result of the exchange of the Steampunk Stock for the Acquisition Stock (the “Share Exchange”), Malta Co. became a wholly owned subsidiary (the “Subsidiary”) of us and there was a change of control of us following the closing. The Shareholders of Malta Co. own approximately 55% of our issued and outstanding common stock. There were no warrants, options or other equity instruments issued in connection with the share exchange agreement.

Following the Share Exchange, we abandoned our prior business plan and we are now pursuing Malta Co.’s historical businesses and proposed businesses. Steampunk develops computer games, applications and merchandise, and already has one game, Bungee Mummy, which was launched in the end of August 2015.
 
We have had limited operations and have been issued a "going concern" opinion by our auditor, based upon our reliance on the sale of our common stock and loans from a related party, as the sole source of funds for our future operations.
 
Malta Co. was incorporated in 2014 to acquire the intellectual property (IP) related to an unfinished game called “Tangled Tut.” Making full use of the team’s experience and diverse talent set, we built the first mobile game with 3D printable rewards embedded and the associated IP and server technology. As a result, we are well positioned to take advantage of one of the major trends in the Electronics Entertainment industry sector, namely the space where virtual and real worlds blur.
 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary, we were an independent games development and technology company specialized in developing enchanting games and gaming technology where the real and virtual worlds blur.
 
Lin resigned from the CEO and sole director positions in on January 29, 2016, on which date Mr. Joshua O’Cock became our CEO, CFO, Secretary and Director.
 
Change of Control
 On October 13, 2016, we entered into a spin-off agreement (the “Spin-Off Agreement”) with Malta Co. and Praefidi Holdings Limited (the “Buyer”), an entity organized under the laws of Malta and owned by Brendon Grunewald (respectively, the “Share Purchase” and the “Spin-Off”). Pursuant to the Spin-Off Agreement, the Buyer received all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Malta Co. and we received $2,000 as purchase price. The Buyer became the sole equity owner of Malta Co. and we have no further interest in Malta Co.
 
On October 13, 2016, shareholders (the “Sellers”), who own, in the aggregate 18,071,445 shares (the “Shares”) of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of us, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Change of Control SP”) with certain purchasers listed thereof pursuant to which the Purchasers acquired the Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $150,000. The transaction contemplated in the Change of Control SP closed on the same day.
 
The Shares represent approximately 65.1% of all the issued and outstanding common stock of us. Therefore, the transaction has resulted in a change of control. (the “Change of Control”)
 
In connection with the Change of Control, Mr. Joshua O’Cock, President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and sole director, resigned from all the director and officer positions with us, meaning that all former directors and officers, including Mr. Brendon Grunewald and Mr. Anton Lin, no longer held any of the director and officer positions.
 
Simultaneously with the closing, Cuilian Cai, was appointed as a director and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
 
Statutory Merger and Name Change
 On October 26, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tianci International, Inc., a newly formed Nevada Corporation ("Merger Sub"), with Merger Sub being the surviving entity. The transaction contemplated in the Merger Agreement (“Merger”) became effective on November 7, 2016.

As permitted by the Nevada Revised Statutes, the sole purpose of the Merger was to effect a change of the company's name from Steampunk Wizards, Inc. to Tianci International, Inc.

(the “Private Placement”) The transaction contemplated in the Private Placement SPA closed on the same day.
 
Business Prior to the Change of Control 

On July 15, 2015, we entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Steampunk Wizards Ltd., a company incorporated pursuant to the laws of Malta (“Malta Co.”), Anton Lin, an individual, and the Company’s former sole officer and director (“Lin”), being the owner of record of 11,451,541 common shares of the Company and the persons listed in Exhibit A thereof (the “Shareholders”), being the owners of record of all of the issued share capital of Malta Co. (the “Steampunk Stock”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, upon surrender by the Shareholders and the cancellation by Malta Co. of the certificates evidencing the Steampunk Stock as registered in the name of each Shareholder, and pursuant to the registration of the Company in the register of members maintained by Malta Co. as the new holder of the Steampunk Stock and the issuance of the certificates evidencing the aforementioned registration of the Steampunk Stock in the name of the Company, on August 21, 2015, the Company issued 4,812,209 shares (the “New Shares”) (subject to adjustment for fractionalized shares as set forth below) of the Company’s common stock to the Shareholders (or their designees), and Lin caused 10,096,229 shares of the Company’s common stock that he owned (the “Lin Stock,” together with the New Shares, the “Acquisition Stock”) to be transferred to the Shareholders (or their designees), which collectively shall represent 55% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company immediately after the Closing, in exchange for the Steampunk Stock, representing 100% of the issued share capital of Malta Co.

The Shareholders of Malta Co. own approximately 55% of our issued and outstanding common stock. There were no warrants, options or other equity instruments issued in connection with the share exchange agreement.
 
Following the Share Exchange, we abandoned our prior business plan and started to to develop computer games, applications and merchandise, and, launched one game, Bungee Mummy, in the end of August 2015.
 
We have had limited operations and have been issued a "going concern" opinion by our auditor, based upon our reliance on the sale of our common stock and loans from a related party, as the sole source of funds for our future operations.
 
Malta Co. was incorporated in 2014 to acquire the intellectual property (IP) related to an unfinished game called “Tangled Tut.”  Making full use of the team’s experience and diverse talent set, the company built the first mobile game with 3D printable rewards embedded and the associated IP and server technology.
 
Through Malta, we were an independent games development and technology company specialized in developing enchanting games and gaming technology where the real and virtual worlds blur.  We had an in-house team of designers, developers, artists, programmers and marketers that allow us to design and develop our own games through every stage from conception to publication.
 
Our first game, a casual game called Bungee Mummy – Challenges, which was launched in late August this year, is a compendium of 4 mini games set in the Bungee Mummy Egyptian theme; it is a mobile game designed primarily for smartphones and tablets (supporting both Android and IOS). Bungee Mummy- King’s Escape is the larger game within the Bungee Mummy franchise, and it was released later in 2015. King’s Escape is an Egyptian themed level-based mobile game (designed primarily for tablets and smartphones) that works on both Android and iOS.  The game had novel game play characteristics which could be described as a cross between Spiderman, Angry Birds and Cut the Rope in its gameplay. In it players swing and catapult themselves through levels while avoiding different obstacles, solving puzzles and killing their enemies along the way. Players access to numerous power-ups and a variety of techniques to help them through the different levels which take players from world to virtual world.
 
From launch to October 5, 2015, Bungee Mummy Challenges received 488 downloads on iOS with a 7-day retention rate of 22%.  During that period it received 1692 downloads on Android, with a 7-day retention rate of 25%.  No advertising was put behind the game, explaining the low download numbers.  Given the higher-than-expected 7-day retention rates, the Challenges game shows good potential.
 
Employees. As of the date of this Annual Report, we had 2 employees.
