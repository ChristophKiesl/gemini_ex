ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Theravance Biopharma, Inc. (“Theravance Biopharma” or the “Company”) is a diversified biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of organ-selective medicines. Our purpose is to create transformational medicines to improve the lives of patients suffering from serious illnesses. Our research is focused in the areas of inflammation and immunology.
​
In pursuit of our purpose, we apply insights and innovation at each stage of our business and utilize our internal capabilities and those of partners around the world. We apply organ-selective expertise to biologically compelling targets to discover and develop medicines designed to treat underserved localized diseases and to limit systemic exposure, in order to maximize patient benefit and minimize risk. These efforts leverage years of experience in developing lung-selective medicines to treat respiratory disease, including the United States (“US”) Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approved YUPELRI® (revefenacin) inhalation solution indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”). Our pipeline of internally discovered programs is targeted to address significant patient needs.
​
We have an economic interest in potential future payments from Glaxo Group or one of its affiliates (“GSK”) pursuant to its agreements with Innoviva, Inc. (“Innoviva”) relating to certain programs, including TRELEGY.
​
2020 Highlights
Despite the delays and disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 was a successful year in terms of progress as our key programs advanced towards important milestones. 
​
YUPELRI Sales Growth
In the second full year since its commercial launch in the first quarter of 2019, YUPELRI continued to experience solid net sales growth in 2020. Through the combined commercialization efforts with our partner Viatris Inc. (formerly, Mylan N.V.), our collaboration revenue related to YUPELRI increased by 221% in 2020 compared to 2019. YUPELRI is the first and only once-daily, nebulized maintenance medicine for COPD. Theravance Biopharma and Viatris copromote in the US, with our combined sales infrastructures targeting health care professionals that treat the universe of COPD patients suitable for YUPELRI. Theravance Biopharma focuses on the hospital segment whereas Viatris focuses on the outpatient segment. While the COVID-19 pandemic impacted YUPELRI’s sales growth trajectory in 2020, we saw sales growth recover in the second half of the year, and we continue to be encouraged by market feedback and performance indicators, including hospital formulary success, patient uptake, and market access, over the past 12 months.
​
Progression of Late-Stage Studies of Ampreloxetine and Izencitinib
Ampreloxetine, our norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, continued to progress in two Phase 3 studies, one designed to assess treatment benefit over four weeks and the other to assess durability of response. Given limitations of existing neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (“nOH”) treatments, ampreloxetine may represent an important treatment option for patients and a meaningful commercial opportunity in the US. To address the challenges presented by COVID-19, we modified our Phase 3 program to allow for a decentralized approach for treating patients in the trial. We anticipate reporting results on our Phase 3 clinical study of ampreloxetine in symptomatic nOH in the third quarter of 2021. 
​
Izencitinib (formerly known as TD-1473), our oral gut-selective pan-JAK inhibitor for inflammatory intestinal diseases, partnered with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (“Janssen”), continued to progress in a Phase 2b/3 study in ulcerative colitis and a Phase 2 study in Crohn’s disease. Izencitinib is intended to treat inflammatory intestinal disease directly at the site of inflammation in an organ-selective manner, with minimal systemic exposure or corresponding immunosuppressive effects. We anticipate reporting results from both studies in the third quarter of 2021.

​
Positive Phase 1 Data and Clinical Progression of TD-0903
TD-0903 is a lung-selective, nebulized Janus kinase inhibitor (“JAKi”) in development for the potential treatment of hospitalized patients with Acute Lung Injury caused by COVID-19. We dosed our first patient in a Phase 1 study in April 2020 and results from that study in healthy volunteers showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile across the full range of nebulized doses and low systemic levels of TD-0903 in the systemic circulation, consistent with the lung-selective design. Data from Phase 1 provided confidence to continue dosing patients in a Phase 2 study, with results expected in the second quarter of 2021.
​
Advancement of TD-5202 into the Clinic
TD-5202, our oral gut-selective irreversible JAK3 inhibitor for inflammatory intestinal diseases, partnered with Janssen, continued to progress in the clinic. In the third quarter of 2019, we initiated a Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose study primarily designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TD-5202 in healthy subjects. In February 2020, we announced that data from the Phase 1 study indicated that TD-5202 was generally well tolerated as a single oral dose up to 2000 milligrams and as a twice-daily oral dose up 2000 milligrams total per day given for ten consecutive days in healthy subjects. We and our partner Janssen believe TD-5202 represents a promising additional therapeutic approach for addressing a range of inflammatory intestinal diseases. 
​
Financing
We successfully closed on two financing transactions during the first quarter of 2020. In February 2020, we closed on an offering of 5,500,000 ordinary shares at a price to the public of $27.00 per share raising $148.5 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Also, in February 2020, we closed on a private placement of $400.0 million of non-recourse Triple II 9.5% fixed rate term notes. The notes are secured by a portion of the future payments we expect to receive related to royalties due on net sales of TRELEGY. We used a portion of the net proceeds from this transaction to repay in full the remaining outstanding balance of the $250.0 million Triple PhaRMASM 9.0% fixed rate term notes due 2033. We are using the remainder of the net proceeds from both transactions to support continued execution of our key development programs.
​
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments, companies, and individuals around the world to attempt to contain the spread of the virus (including new variants of COVID-19) continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge and is affecting our employees, patients, communities, clinical trial sites, suppliers, business partners and business operations. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, including revenue, expenses, clinical trials and research and development costs, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and may be impacted by the emergence of new information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing spread of the disease across the US and the globe, and the actions taken to contain or treat the disease, including vaccine availability, distribution, acceptance and effectiveness.
​
YUPELRI (revefenacin) Inhalation Solution
​
We and our collaboration partner, Viatris, continue to supply YUPELRI to our patients and currently do not anticipate any interruptions in supply. The manufacture of YUPELRI continues at or near normal levels. 
​
In mid-March 2020, we suspended in-person sales calls to accounts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our promotional focus and efforts quickly pivoted to increased digital promotional investments and, in early August 2020, leveraging an optimized hybrid selling model with virtual and in-person selling interactions. While overall market challenges remain due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, YUPELRI increased its market share and it was profitable on a stand-alone brand basis for the first time in the second half of 2020. 
​

5



We continue to monitor the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on demand for YUPELRI, including the duration and degree to which we may see declines in customer orders or delays in starting new patients on YUPELRI.
​
At this time, we are unable to predict with certainty the ultimate disruptive impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on both YUPELRI and the rest of our business, but we believe the pandemic may continue to put downward pressure on our sales to the extent that it continues to depress in-person customer interactions.
​
Clinical Trial Activity
​
While we are currently continuing the clinical trials that we had underway in sites across the globe prior to the onset of the pandemic, the timelines have been adversely impacted. We frequently evaluate each of our clinical trial programs to determine any additional necessary modifications and have worked closely with regulators, sites, clinical research organizations and data safety monitoring boards. Given the significant strains on the healthcare system across the globe, we made the decision in mid-March 2020 to temporarily suspend the screening of new patients for our clinical trials of izencitinib, a gut-selective oral JAKi in development for inflammatory intestinal disease in Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis, and ampreloxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (“NRI”) under evaluation for the treatment of symptomatic nOH, which are further discussed below. The screening of new patients into these trials was temporarily suspended for 4 weeks in order to prioritize ongoing support for patients who were already in screening and those who were already randomized. We implemented mitigation plans to help ensure patients in the clinical trials continued to have access to drug supply and regular visits with their physicians for study visits per trial protocols. 
​
Screening of new patients resumed in mid-April 2020 in a controlled and measured fashion as individual sites confirmed their ability to support the study requirements, and new patients were able to be assessed for their eligibility to participate in the izencitinib and ampreloxetine studies. Study sites and necessary supporting medical infrastructure for our studies, such as endoscopy suites for our study of izencitinib in ulcerative colitis, have been gradually available for participation in and support of our trial through the year, increasing as cases dip and deceasing as cases surge. In recognition of the increasing range of barriers presented by the ongoing pandemic on the ability of nOH patients to travel to sites and access medicines, we worked with the FDA to decentralize the Phase 3 studies in the ampreloxetine program. We are working to offer the decentralized approach across the ampreloxetine Phase 3 program in the US and globally in an effort to overcome the challenges patients face regarding travel, healthcare access and participation in clinical trials. We currently expect Phase 3 results for ampreloxetine for symptomatic nOH and for izencitinib Phase 2b results in ulcerative colitis and Phase 2 results in Crohn's disease in the third quarter of 2021.
​
During the second quarter of 2020, we progressed our preclinical candidate TD-0903 into the clinic at an accelerated pace in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We designed TD-0903 to be a lung-selective nebulized JAKi with the intent of addressing lung hyperinflammation in both the acute and chronic setting. In June 2020, we completed Phase 1 and entered a two-part Phase 2 study in the United Kingdom (“UK”) to explore the potential of TD-0903 to treat hospitalized patients with Acute Lung Injury caused by COVID-19 and prevent progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and the need for assisted ventilation. To expedite enrollment, we opened additional sites in other regions including Europe, US, South Africa and South America. We have completed Phase 2, Part 1 dose escalation and moved into Part 2. Phase 2, Part 2 is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study evaluating efficacy and safety of one dose (3 mg) of TD-0903 (selected based on the data from Part 1) as compared with placebo in 198 hospitalized patients with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen. We expect to report results from the Phase 2, Part 2 study in the second quarter of 2021.
​
Business Operations
​
We continue to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and plan to continue taking steps to identify and attempt to mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The threat of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing a work from home policy for all employees, with the exception of key operations and lab personnel, since early March 2020. We have restricted all non-essential business travel, and we expect to continue to implement measures as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we

Program Highlights
YUPELRI (revefenacin) Inhalation Solution
​
YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution is a once-daily, nebulized long-acting muscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”) approved for the maintenance treatment of COPD in the US. LAMAs are recognized by international COPD treatment guidelines as a cornerstone of maintenance therapy for COPD, regardless of severity of disease. Our market research indicates there is an enduring population of COPD patients in the US that either need or prefer nebulized delivery for maintenance therapy. The stability of revefenacin in both metered dose inhaler and dry powder inhaler (“MDI/DPI”) formulations suggests that revefenacin could also serve as a foundation for novel handheld combination products. 
​
In November 2018, YUPELRI was approved by the FDA for the maintenance treatment of patients with COPD. Following shipments into commercial channel in late 2018, we and Viatris formally launched our sales and marketing efforts in early 2019. As described above and in Item 1A. Risk Factor entitled “We face risks related to health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations,” although YUPELRI net sales growth continued for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019, the trajectory was impacted by COVID-19, and we have observed increased volatility in YUPELRI sales. However, our YUPELRI operations were profitable on a brand basis for the first time in the second half of 2020. In addition, we are tracking several key performance metrics to gauge success in building market acceptance, including formulary success and market access. 
​
Viatris Collaboration
​
In January 2015, Viatris and we established a strategic collaboration for the development and commercialization of revefenacin. Partnering with a leader in nebulized respiratory therapies enables us to expand the breadth of our revefenacin development program and extend our commercial reach beyond the acute care setting. Viatris funded the Phase 3 development program of YUPELRI, enabling us to advance other high value pipeline assets alongside YUPELRI.
​
Under the terms of the Viatris Development and Commercialization Agreement (the “Viatris Agreement”), Viatris and we co-develop revefenacin for COPD and other respiratory diseases. We led the US Phase 3 development program for YUPELRI in COPD, and Viatris was responsible for reimbursement of our costs related to the registrational program up until the approval of the first new drug application (“NDA”), after which costs are shared. With YUPELRI approved in the US, Viatris is leading commercialization, and we co-promote the product in the US under a profit and loss sharing arrangement (65% to Viatris; 35% to Theravance Biopharma). Outside the US, Viatris is responsible for development and commercialization and will pay us a tiered royalty on net sales at percentage royalty rates ranging from low double-digits to mid-teens. 
​
In June 2019, we announced the expansion of the Viatris Agreement to grant Viatris exclusive development and commercialization rights to nebulized revefenacin in China and adjacent territories, which include Hong Kong SAR, the Macau SAR, and Taiwan. In exchange, we received an upfront payment of $18.5 million (before a required tax withholding) and will be eligible to receive additional potential development and sales milestones totaling $54.0 million and low double-digit tiered royalties on net sales of nebulized revefenacin, if approved. In March 2020, we earned a $1.5 million development milestone for the acceptance of a clinical trial application associated with the use of revefenacin monotherapy in China and adjacent territories. Viatris is responsible for all aspects of development and commercialization in the partnered regions, including pre- and post-launch activities and product registration and all associated costs. We retain worldwide rights to revefenacin delivered through other dosage forms, such as a MDI/DPI.
​
Under the Viatris Agreement, as of December 31, 2020, we are eligible to receive from Viatris potential global development, regulatory and sales milestone payments totaling up to $257.5 million in the aggregate with $205.0 million associated with YUPELRI monotherapy and $52.5 million associated with future potential combination products. Of the $205.0 million associated with monotherapy, $187.5 million relates to sales milestones based on achieving certain levels of net sales and $17.5 million relates to global development and regulatory actions. The $52.5 million associated with future potential combination products relates solely to global development and regulatory actions.

​
Lung-selective, Nebulized Pan-Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitor (TD-0903)
​
TD-0903 is a lung-selective, nebulized Janus kinase inhibitor (“JAKi”), in clinical development for the potential treatment of hospitalized patients with Acute Lung Injury (“ALI”) caused by COVID-19. We discovered TD-0903, and it has been shown in experimental murine models to have potent, broad inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling in the airways following challenges with multiple cytokines. Preclinical studies suggest that TD-0903 has a very high lung to plasma ratio and rapid metabolic clearance resulting in low systemic exposure, compatible with its lung selectivity. TD-0903 is administered via nebulized inhalation solution, which further enhances its lung selectivity. Preclinical pharmacodynamic studies indicate that TD-0903 has an extended duration of action that should enable once daily dosing in humans. 
​
We believe TD-0903 has the potential to inhibit the cytokine storm associated with ALI and prevent progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (“ARDS”). The first healthy volunteer was dosed in a Phase 1 study of TD-0903 in April 2020, and in June 2020, we completed Phase 1 and entered a two-part Phase 2 study. Phase 2 is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TD-0903 in subjects with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 hospitalized for symptomatic respiratory insufficiency. This study will also evaluate the PK of TD-0903 in these subjects. To expedite enrollment, we opened additional sites in other regions including Europe, the US, South Africa and South America. 
​
We completed Phase 2, Part 1 a small sub-study of 25 patients intended to assess safety, PK and exploratory clinical measures of three doses of TD-0903 versus placebo. Data showed that inhaled administration of nebulized TD-0903, once daily over seven days, was generally well-tolerated and showed a numerical trend towards improved clinical status, reduced hospital stay and fewer deaths compared to placebo during a 28-day observation period. TD-0903 also demonstrated evidence of improvements in several relevant inflammatory biomarkers and low systemic exposure at all doses. This demonstrates the lung-selective design features of the molecule.
​
We have moved into Phase 2 Part 2, which is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study evaluating efficacy and safety of one dose (3 mg) of TD-0903 (selected based on the data from Part 1) as compared with placebo in 198 patients. We expect to report results from the Phase 2 Part 2 study in the second quarter of 2021.
​
Ampreloxetine (TD-9855)
​
Ampreloxetine is an investigational, once-daily norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (“NRI”) being developed for the treatment of patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (“nOH”). nOH is caused by primary autonomic failure conditions, including multiple system atrophy, Parkinson’s disease and pure autonomic failure. The compound has high affinity for binding to norepinephrine transporters. By blocking the action of these transporters, ampreloxetine causes an increase in extracellular concentrations of norepinephrine. Ampreloxetine is wholly owned by us.
​
Based on positive top-line four-week results from a small exploratory Phase 2 study in nOH and discussions with the FDA, we advanced ampreloxetine into a Phase 3 program. The Phase 3 program includes two studies. The first study (SEQUOIA) is a four-week, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ampreloxetine in patients with symptomatic nOH. The second study (REDWOOD) is a four-month open label study followed by a six-week randomized withdrawal phase to evaluate the durability of patient response of ampreloxetine. We announced the initiation of patient dosing in each Phase 3 study in early 2019. Phase 3 also includes a 26-week open-label study (OAK), which is a long-term extension study that will be ongoing at the time of registration, to allow participants completing REDWOOD to have continued access to ampreloxetine for up to 3.5 years and to collect safety and tolerability data over the course of treatment. As described above and in Item 1A. Risk Factors, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the timeline for our clinical trials. In recognition of the increasing range of barriers presented by the ongoing pandemic on the ability of patients to travel to sites and access medicines, we worked with the FDA to decentralize the Phase 3 studies in the ampreloxetine program. We are working to offer the decentralized approach across the ampreloxetine Phase 3 program in the US and globally in an effort to overcome the challenges patients face regarding travel, healthcare access and participation in clinical trials. We expect the SEQUOIA study to report data in the third quarter of 2021.

​
Gut-selective Pan-JAK Inhibitor Program (Izencitinib) 
​
JAK inhibitors function by inhibiting the activity of one or more of the Janus kinase family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2) that play a key role in cytokine signaling. Inhibiting these JAK enzymes interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. JAK inhibitors are currently approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, myelofibrosis, and ulcerative colitis and have demonstrated therapeutic benefit for patients with Crohn’s disease. However, these products are known to have side effects based on their systemic exposure. In izencitinib, our program goal is to develop an orally administered, gut-selective pan-JAK inhibitor specifically designed to distribute adequately and predominantly to the tissues of the intestinal tract, treating inflammation in those tissues while minimizing systemic exposure. We believe izencitinib could be a potential treatment for a range of inflammatory intestinal diseases, and it is in development for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. 
​
Based on positive results from a Phase 1b exploratory study in ulcerative colitis and following dialogues with the FDA and European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) regarding study design, we advanced izencitinib into two clinical studies in inflammatory intestinal diseases. The Phase 2 (DIONE) study is a twelve-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patients with Crohn’s disease, which began dosing patients in late 2018. The Phase 2b/3 (RHEA) study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of eight weeks induction and 44 weeks maintenance therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis, which began dosing patients in early 2019. As described above and in Item 1A. Risk Factors, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the timeline for our clinical trials. Data from the Phase 2b portion of the ulcerative colitis study and the Phase 2 Crohn’s disease studies is expected in the third quarter of 2021.
​
Irreversible JAK3 Inhibitor (TD-5202)
​
TD-5202 is an investigational, orally administered, gut-selective, irreversible JAK3 inhibitor that has demonstrated a high affinity for the JAK3 enzyme. Through the selective inhibition of JAK3, TD-5202 interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of select pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21 which play a central role in the pathogenesis of T-cell mediated disease, including inflammatory intestinal disease, such as celiac disease. Importantly, TD-5202 is specifically designed to act locally within the intestinal wall thereby limiting systemic exposure. 
​
In September 2019, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose trial designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TD-5202 in healthy participants, plus assess plasma pharmacokinetics of TD-5202 to confirm circulating levels are low, consistent with a gut-selective approach. In February 2020, we announced that data from the Phase 1 study indicated that TD-5202 was generally well tolerated as a single oral dose up to 2000 milligrams and as a twice-daily oral dose up 2000 milligrams total per day given for ten consecutive days in healthy participants. 
​
We are developing izencitinib and TD-5202 in collaboration with Janssen as part of the companies’ global co-development and commercialization agreement for novel, gut-selective JAK inhibitors. 
​
Janssen Biotech Collaboration
​
In February 2018, we announced a global co-development and commercialization agreement with Janssen for izencitinib and related back-up compounds for inflammatory intestinal diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $100.0 million and will be eligible to receive up to an additional $900.0 million in potential payments, inclusive of a potential opt-in payment following completion of the Phase 2 Crohn’s study and the Phase 2b induction portion of the ulcerative colitis study. At that time, Janssen can elect to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize izencitinib and certain related compounds by paying us a fee of $200.0 million. Upon such election, we and Janssen will jointly develop and commercialize izencitinib in inflammatory intestinal diseases, and we and Janssen will share profits and losses in the US and expenses related to a potential Phase 3 program (67% to Janssen; 33% to Theravance Biopharma). In addition, we would receive royalties on ex-US sales at double-digit tiered percentage royalty rates.
​

10



The closing of the opt-in portion of the transaction is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (“HSR Act”). After Phase 2, Janssen would lead subsequent development of izencitinib in Crohn’s disease if it makes such an election. We will lead development of izencitinib in ulcerative colitis through completion of the Phase 2b/3 study. If izencitinib is commercialized, we have the option to co-commercialize in the US, and Janssen would have sole commercialization responsibilities outside the US. 
​
Lung-selective Pan-JAK Inhibitor Program (TD-8236)
​
TD-8236 is an investigational, inhaled lung-selective pan-JAK inhibitor that has demonstrated a high affinity for each of the JAK family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) that play a key role in cytokine signaling. Inhibiting these JAK enzymes interferes with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and, in turn, modulates the activity of a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines. While orally-administered JAK inhibitors are currently approved for the treatment of a range of inflammatory diseases, no inhaled JAK inhibitor is approved for the treatment of airway disease, including asthma. The pan-JAK activity of TD-8236 suggests that it may impact a broad range of cytokines that have been associated both T2-high and T2-low asthma. Many moderate to severe asthma patients comprising both T2 phenotypes remain symptomatic despite being compliant on high doses of inhaled steroids. Importantly, TD-8236 is designed to distribute and exert its anti-inflammatory effect within the lungs following dry powder inhalation, with the potential to treat inflammation within that organ while minimizing systemic exposure. In preclinical assessments, TD-8236 has shown to potently inhibit targeted mediators of T2-high and T2-low asthma in human cells. 
​
In September 2019, we announced positive results from a Phase 1 single-ascending dose and multiple-ascending dose clinical trial of TD-8236. The Part C extension portion of the Phase 1 trial, assessing additional biomarkers in patients with moderate to severe asthma, demonstrated that biomarkers of JAK target engagement (including exhaled nitric oxide and pSTAT1 and pSTAT6 in cellular fractions of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) were reduced after 7 days of once-daily dosing at a dose level of 1500 µg. In December 2019, we announced the initiation of a Phase 2 allergen challenge study of TD-8236 in mild allergic asthma patients, and we reported results of the Phase 1C study in the third quarter of 2020. TD-8236 is the first JAK inhibitor to be studied in a Phase 2a Lung Allergen Challenge (“LAC”) study, but inconsistent with our expectations, it had no impact on decrease in lung function (FEV1) following allergen inhalation after 14 days of once-daily dosing at dose levels of 150 µg and 1500 µg compared to placebo and did not meet the primary study objective. The collective data set (preclinical, Phase 1, Phase 2a) demonstrates TD-8236 engages the JAK mechanism at a dose of 1500 µg as evidenced by the reduction in FeNO and reductions in pSTAT, but does not protect against the lung function decline seen after allergen inhalation. 
​
After completing additional analysis on TD-8236 gene signature and biomarker data from the Phase 1C study, we found that the data are consistent with target engagement in the lung. However, based on our current understanding of TD-8236, we have decided to pause the clinical program for this specific compound in its current form and apply our learnings to refining and expanding molecules in our portfolio of inhaled JAK inhibitors. The robust body of scientific evidence from TD-8236 and TD-0903 programs provide confidence for us to continue the lung-selective inhaled JAK inhibitor program for asthma. The full data set for TD-8236 will be presented at future scientific meetings.

TRELEGY (the combination of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol)
TRELEGY provides the activity of an inhaled corticosteroid (FF) plus two bronchodilators (UMEC, a LAMA, and VI, a long-acting beta2 agonist, or LABA) in a single delivery device administered once-daily. TRELEGY is approved for use in the US and European Union (“EU”) for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of patients with COPD. We hold an 85% economic interest in the royalties payable by GSK to TRC on worldwide net sales (net of TRC expenses paid and the amount of cash, if any, expected to be used by TRC pursuant to the TRC LLC Agreement over the next four fiscal quarters) through our interest in TRC. Those royalties are upward-tiering from 6.5% to 10%, resulting in cash flows to us of approximately 5.5% to 8.5% of worldwide net sales of TRELEGY (net of TRC expenses paid and the amount of cash, if any, expected to be used by TRC pursuant to the TRC LLC Agreement over the next four fiscal quarters). Theravance Biopharma is not responsible for any of GSK’s costs related to the development or commercialization of TRELEGY.
​
GSK and Innoviva conducted two global pivotal Phase 3 studies of TRELEGY in COPD, the IMPACT study and the FULFIL study. In September 2017, GSK and Innoviva announced that the FDA approved TRELEGY for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of appropriate patients with COPD. In August 2019, GSK announced that it had filed a supplemental new drug application (“sNDA”) to the FDA supporting revised labelling for TRELEGY on reduction in risk of all-cause mortality compared with ANORO ELLIPTA in patients with COPD. The FDA postponed an Advisory Committee meeting that was previously scheduled for April 21, 2020 related to this sNDA which was subsequently rescheduled for August 31, 2020. During the FDA’s Advisory Committee, the panel voted against the proposed all-cause mortality labeling claim. GSK announced during their third-quarter conference call on October 28, 2020 that the company received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for the label update.
​
Additionally, GSK and Innoviva conducted a Phase 3 (CAPTAIN) study of TRELEGY in patients with asthma. In May 2019, GSK and Innoviva announced that the study had met its primary endpoint, and in October 2019, GSK announced it had filed a sNDA with the FDA seeking an additional indication for the use of once-daily, single-inhaler triple therapy, TRELEGY, for the treatment of asthma in adults. The FDA approved the asthma sNDA in September 2020 making TRELEGY the first once-daily single inhaler triple therapy for the treatment of both asthma and COPD in the US.
​
Theravance Respiratory Company, LLC
Prior to the June 2014 spin-off from Innoviva, our former parent company, Innoviva assigned to Theravance Respiratory Company, LLC (“TRC”), a Delaware limited liability company formed by Innoviva, its strategic alliance agreement with GSK and all of its rights and obligations under its collaboration agreement with GSK, other than with respect to RELVAR ELLIPTA/BREO ELLIPTA, ANORO ELLIPTA and vilanterol monotherapy. 
​
Our equity interest in TRC is the mechanism by which we are entitled to the 85% economic interest in any future payments made by GSK under the strategic alliance agreement and under the portion of the collaboration agreement assigned to TRC by Innoviva (net of TRC expenses paid and the amount of cash, if any, expected to be used by TRC pursuant to the TRC LLC Agreement over the next four fiscal quarters). TRELEGY is currently the only commercial product arising out of the GSK agreements assigned by Innoviva to TRC. Royalty payments from GSK to TRC arising from the net sales of Trelegy are presented in our consolidated statements of operations within “Income from investment in TRC, LLC” and is classified as non-operating income. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we also recorded $8.5 million within “Income from investment in TRC, LLC” representing our share of a $10.0 million fee that GSK agreed to pay TRC upon termination of the inhaled Bifunctional Muscarinic Antagonist-Beta2 Agonist  (“MABA”) program in June 2020. Seventy-five percent of the “Income from investment in TRC, LLC,” as evidenced by the Issuer II Class C Units (defined below), is available only for payment of the $400.0 million aggregate amount of 9.5% fixed rate non-recourse term notes due 2035 (the “Non-Recourse 2035 Notes”) and is not available to pay our other obligations or the claims of our other creditors. 
​
Our special purpose subsidiary Triple Royalty Sub II LLC (the “Issuer II”) issued the Non-Recourse 2035 Notes in February 2020, the proceeds of which were used in part to repay the outstanding balance of our 9.0% non-recourse notes, due on or before 2033 (the “Non-Recourse 2033 Notes”) that were issued in November 2018. The Non-Recourse 2035 Notes are secured by all of the Issuer II’s rights, title and interest as a holder of certain membership 

12



interests (the “Issuer II Class C Units”) in TRC. The Issuer II Class C Units entitle the Issuer II to receive 63.75% of the economic interest that TRC receives in any future payments made by GSK under the agreements described above, or 75% of the income from our 85% ownership interest in TRC. 
​
On June 10, 2020, we disclosed in a Form 8-K that we had formally objected to TRC and Innoviva, as the manager of TRC, regarding their proposed plan to use TRELEGY royalties to invest in certain privately-held companies, funds that would otherwise be available for distribution to us under the terms of the TRC LLC Agreement. We intend to continue to seek to protect our interests in this matter consistent with the dispute resolution procedures of the TRC LLC Agreement. In this regard, we initiated an arbitration proceeding against Innoviva and TRC in October 2020 challenging the authority of Innoviva and TRC to pursue such a business plan rather than distribute such funds to us in a manner consistent with the TRC LLC Agreement and our 85% economic interest in TRC. The arbitration hearing was held during the week of February 16, 2021, with post-hearing briefing and arguments to take place over the next few weeks. We currently anticipate a decision in those proceedings near the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2021.
​
Other Economic Interests
Selective 5-HT4 Agonist (TD-8954)
​
TD-8954 is a selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist being developed for potential use in the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders. 
​
Takeda Collaborative Arrangement
​
In June 2016, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (the “Takeda Agreement”) with Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Millennium”), in order to establish a collaboration for the development and commercialization of TD-8954 (TAK-954). Millennium is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”). TD-8954 is currently in a Phase 2 study as a potential treatment for post-operative gastrointestinal dysfunction. Under the terms of the Takeda Agreement, Takeda is responsible for worldwide development and commercialization of TD-8954. We received an upfront cash payment of $15.0 million and will be eligible to receive success-based development, regulatory and sales milestone payments from Takeda. We will also be eligible to receive a tiered royalty on worldwide net sales by Takeda at percentage royalty rates ranging from low double-digits to mid-teens.
​
Skin-selective Pan-JAK inhibitor program 
In December 2019, we entered into a global license agreement with Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”) for our preclinical skin-selective, locally-acting pan-JAK inhibitor program (the “Pfizer Agreement”). The compounds in this program are designed to target validated pro-inflammatory pathways and are specifically designed to possess skin-selective activity with minimal systemic exposure.
​
Under the Pfizer Agreement, Pfizer has an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain compounds for all uses other than gastrointestinal, ophthalmic and respiratory applications. We received an upfront cash payment of $10.0 million and are eligible to receive up to an additional $240.0 million in development and sales milestone payments from Pfizer. In addition, we are eligible to receive a tiered royalty on worldwide net sales of any potential products under the license at percentage royalty rates ranging from middle single-digits to low double-digits.
​
Research Projects
Our research goal is to design organ-selective medicines that target diseased tissues, without systemic exposure, in order to maximize patient benefit and minimize risk. The intention is to expand the therapeutic index of our potential medicines compared to conventional systemic therapies. Our efforts leverage years of experience in developing lung-selective medicines, such as YUPELRI, to treat respiratory diseases, and have led to the discovery of the gut-selective pan-JAK inhibitor izencitinib and irreversible JAK3 inhibitor TD-5202 for inflammatory intestinal diseases and the lung-selective inhaled JAK inhibitor TD-8236 and nebulized pan JAK inhibitor TD-0903 in serious respiratory disease. We plan to advance towards the clinic other research projects with various mechanisms of action, each specifically tailored for the organ of interest, as we identify and validate potentially appropriate compounds. Our research is focused 

13



in the areas of inflammation and immunology, and our pipeline of internally discovered programs is targeted to address significant patient needs. 
​
Our Strategy
Our core purpose is to create transformational medicines to improve the lives of patients suffering from serious illnesses. We strive to apply insight and innovation at each stage of our business, including research, development and commercialization. Our principle strategic objective is to transform the treatment of serious diseases through the discovery, development, and commercialization of organ-selective medicines designed to maximize patient benefit while minimizing patient risk.
​
We follow these core guiding principles in our mission to drive value creation:
​

• | Focus on insight and innovation;
--+---------------------------------


• | Outsource non-core activities;
--+-------------------------------


• | Create and foster an integrated environment; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Aggressively manage uncertainty.
--+---------------------------------

We manage our pipeline with the goal of optimizing program value and allocation of resources. We employ multiple strategies for commercialization of our products. Our approach may involve retaining product rights and marketing a product independently in the US or we may partner a product to extend our commercial reach, to expand our geographic reach, and/or to manage the financial risk associated with the program. Alternatively, we may monetize or divest an asset that we designate as outside our core business, where we believe the program is optimized by leveraging partner capabilities and removing or limiting our research and development costs.
​
Manufacturing
We rely primarily on a network of third-party manufacturers, including contract manufacturing organizations, to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) and drug products required for our clinical trials and drug product. We believe that we and our partners have in-house expertise to manage this network of third-party manufacturers, and we believe that we will be able to continue to negotiate third-party manufacturing arrangements on commercially reasonable terms and that it will not be necessary for us to rely on internal manufacturing capacity in order to develop or, potentially, commercialize our products. However, if we are unable to obtain contract manufacturing or obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms, or if manufacturing is interrupted at one of our suppliers, whether due to regulatory or other reasons, we may not be able to develop our products or commercialize product as planned.
​
Any inability to acquire sufficient quantities of API or drug product in a timely manner from current or future sources could disrupt our research and development programs, the conduct of future clinical trials or our commercialization efforts. For more information, see the risk factor under the heading “There is a single source of supply for a number of our product candidates and for YUPELRI, and our business will be harmed if any of these single-source manufacturers are not able to satisfy demand and alternative sources are not available” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Government Regulation 
The development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and our product candidates by us, our collaboration partners and licensees, GSK, and Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Cumberland”) and our ongoing research are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the US and other countries. Before marketing in the US, any medicine must undergo rigorous preclinical studies and clinical studies and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Outside the US, the ability to market a product depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities which are subject to equally rigorous regulatory obligations. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, 

14



marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In any country, however, the commercialization of pharmaceutical products is permitted only if the appropriate regulatory authority is satisfied that we have presented adequate evidence of the safety, quality and efficacy of the product.
​
Before commencing clinical studies in humans in the US, we must submit to the FDA an investigational new drug application (“IND”) that includes, among other things, the general investigational plan and protocols for specific human studies and the results of preclinical studies. An IND will go into effect 30 days following its receipt by the FDA unless the FDA issues a clinical hold. Once clinical studies have begun under the IND, they are usually conducted in three phases and under FDA oversight. These phases generally include the following:
​
Phase 1. The product candidate is introduced into patients or healthy human volunteers and is tested for safety, dose tolerance and pharmacokinetics.
​
Phase 2. The product candidate is introduced into a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications, assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
​
Phase 3. If a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, the clinical study will be expanded to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population.
​
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. The NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) establishes timeframes for FDA review of NDAs, with a performance goal of reviewing and acting on 90 percent of priority new molecular entity (“NME”) NDA submissions within 6 months of the 60-day filing date, and to review and act on 90 percent of standard NME NDA submissions within 10 months of the 60-day filing date. The 2007 Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act gave the FDA authority to require implementation of a formal Risk Evaluation and Management Strategy to ensure that the benefits of a product outweigh its risks. At the end of the review period, the FDA communicates either approval of the NDA or a complete response listing the application’s deficiencies.
​
Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety or quality issues are identified after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, to monitor the safety and effectiveness of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. The FDA has broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations, and initiate criminal prosecution.
​
If regulatory approval for a medicine is obtained, the clearance to market the product will be limited to those diseases and conditions approved by FDA and for which the medicine was shown to be effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies and specified in the medicine’s labeling. Even if this regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed medicine, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA ensures the quality of approved medicines by carefully monitoring manufacturers’ compliance with its current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations. The cGMP regulations for drugs contain minimum requirements for the methods, facilities, and controls used in manufacturing, processing, and packaging of a medicine. The regulations are intended to make sure that a medicine is safe for use, and that it has the ingredients and strength it claims to have. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a medicine, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the medicine or manufacturer, including costly recalls or withdrawal of the medicine from the market.
​
We, our collaboration partners and licensees are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize 

15



products, withdraw approvals, enjoin violations, and initiate criminal prosecution, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.
​
Outside the US our, our collaboration partners’, licensees’, GSK’s and Cumberland’s ability to market products will also depend on receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. Risks similar to those associated with FDA approval described above exist with the regulatory approval processes in other countries.
​
United States Healthcare Reform
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together the “Healthcare Reform Act”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and impacts pricing and reimbursement of YUPELRI and the marketed drugs with respect to which we are entitled to royalty or similar payments, and related commercial operations. Certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to repeal or replace them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. We expect that the Healthcare Reform Act, its implementation, efforts to repeal or replace, or invalidate, the Healthcare Reform Act or portions thereof, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on the ability of us, our collaboration partners, or those commercializing products with respect to which we have an economic interest or right to receive royalties to maintain or increase sales of our existing products or to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved. For more information, see the risk factor under the heading “Changes in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as healthcare policy and other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may negatively impact us, our collaboration partners, or those commercializing products with respect to which we have an economic interest or right to receive royalties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement 
We participated in and had certain price reporting obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program for VIBATIV for which we remain responsible, as described in greater detail under the risk factor “If we failed to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Our ability, and the ability of our collaboration partners, licensees, or those commercializing products with respect to which we have an economic interest or right to receive royalties to commercialize our products successfully, and our ability to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including, in the US, governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. The reimbursement environment is described in greater detail under the risk factor “Changes in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as healthcare policy and other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may negatively impact us, our collaboration partners, or those commercializing products with respect to which we have an economic interest or right to receive royalties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Fraud and Abuse Laws
Our interactions and arrangements with customers and third-party payors are subject to applicable US federal and state fraud and abuse laws and equivalent third country laws. These laws and the related risks are described in greater detail under the risk factor “Our relationships with customers and third-party payors are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​

16



Data Privacy and Protection 
We are subject to laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. In the US, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information and/or genetic privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”)), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Similar obligations apply outside of the US. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which entered into force on May 25, 2018 amplified existing data protection obligations in the EU. These laws and related risks are described in greater detail under the risk factor “If we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
​
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our technology is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Our success in the future will depend in part on obtaining patent protection for our product candidates. Accordingly, patents and other proprietary rights are essential elements of our business. Our policy is to seek in the US and selected foreign countries patent protection for novel technologies and compositions of matter that are commercially important to the development of our business. For proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug discovery process that involve proprietary know-how and technology that is not covered by patent applications, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require all of our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. Where it is necessary to share our proprietary information or data with outside parties, our policy is to make available only that information and data required to accomplish the desired purpose and only pursuant to a duty of confidentiality on the part of those parties.
​
As of December 31, 2020, we owned 507 issued US patents and 2,253 granted foreign patents, as well as additional pending US patent applications and foreign patent applications. The claims in these various patents and patent applications are typically directed to compositions of matter, including claims covering product candidates, crystalline forms, lead compounds and key intermediates, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use and/or processes for making our compounds. In particular, our wholly-owned subsidiary Theravance Biopharma R&D IP, LLC owns the following US patents which are listed in the FDA Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) for YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution: US Patent No. 7,288,657, expiring on December 23, 2025; US Patent No. 7,491,736, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 7,521,041, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 7,550,595, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 7,585,879, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 7,910,608, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 8,034,946, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 8,053,448, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 8,273,894, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 8,541,451, expiring August 25, 2031; US Patent No. 9,765,028, expiring July 14, 2030; US Patent No. 10,106,503, expiring March 10, 2025; US Patent No. 10,343,995, expiring March 10, 2025; and US Patent No. 10,550,081, expiring July 14, 2030 (each of the aforementioned expiration dates not including any patent term extensions that may be available under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984). Thus, the last to expire patent currently listed in the Orange Book for YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution expires on August 25, 2031. On December 19, 2018, we filed patent term extension (“PTE”) applications in the US Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for US Patent Nos. 7,288,657 and 7,585,879. These PTE applications are currently pending and if granted, we will be permitted to extend the term of one of these patents for the period determined by the USPTO. 
​
Issued US and foreign patents generally expire 20 years after their filing date. The patent rights relating to YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution currently consist of issued US patents, pending US patent applications and counterpart patents and patent applications in a number of jurisdictions, including Europe. Additionally, our patent rights relating to ampreloxetine and izencitinib currently include issued US composition of matter patents that expire in 2030 and 2036, respectively (not including any patent term extensions that may be available under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984), as well as additional issued US patents, pending US patent applications and/or counterpart patents and patent applications in a number of jurisdictions. Nevertheless, issued patents can be 

17



challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products and threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Our patent position, similar to other companies in our industry, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. To maintain our proprietary position, we will need to obtain effective claims and enforce these claims once granted. It is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force only for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. Also, we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in any issued patents or, if issued, whether the scope of the issued claims will be sufficient to protect our proprietary position.
​
Competition
Our late-stage development programs, and the marketed products to which we are entitled to profit share revenue, royalty or similar payments, primarily target three therapeutic areas— respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological. In research, we apply organ-selective expertise to biologically compelling targets to discover and develop medicines designed to treat underserved localized diseases and to limit systemic exposure, in order to maximize patient benefit and minimize risk. Our commercial infrastructure is focused primarily on the acute care setting. We expect that any medicines that we commercialize with our collaborative partners or on our own will compete with existing and future market-leading medicines.
​
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to leverage our experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization to:
​

• | discover and develop medicines that are superior to other products in the market;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | attract and retain qualified scientific, clinical development and commercial personnel;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our medicines and technologies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain required regulatory approvals;
--+--------------------------------------


• | commercialize approved products; and
--+-------------------------------------


• | successfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YUPELRI (revefenacin) inhalation solution, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)
YUPELRI competes predominately with the nebulized LAMA Lonhala® Magnair® (glycopyrrolate) dosed two times per day and with short acting nebulized bronchodilators that are dosed three to four times per day. 
​
Trelegy or FF/UMEC/VI (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol)
For treatment of COPD, Trelegy competes in the US with AstraZeneca’s Breztri® Aerosphere® (budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate, dosed twice per day). Breztri was approved for COPD by EMA in December 2020 and is expected to launch in 2021. Trimbow (beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate/glycopyrronium bromide, dosed twice per day) from Chiesi Farmaceutici is an additional COPD competitor in Europe. TRELEGY also competes with Breztri in Japan and China for COPD.
​
For treatment of asthma, TRELEGY is the only triple therapy approved in the US and competes in Japan with Novartis’s Enerzair® Breezhaler® (indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide and mometasone furoate, dosed once daily). Enerzair and Trimbow are currently under review by EMA, and, if approved in Europe they will compete with TRELEGY.
​

18



In both COPD and asthma, TRELEGY also competes with “open triple” therapy which can be accomplished by the concurrent use of two or three products. An example of such use includes a LABA/ICS combination such as AstraZeneca’s Symbicort and a LAMA such as Boehringer Ingelheim’s Spiriva.
​
Gut-selective Pan-JAK Inhibitor Program (Izencitinib) 
If successfully developed and approved, izencitinib would be expected to compete with biologics, which have become the mainstay of treatment in moderate-to-severe IBD patients, steroids, immunosuppressants, and other JAK inhibitors (all of which provide systemic exposure and are, thus, not gut-selective). Biologics for treatment of IBD (all of which require intravenous or sub-cutaneous administration) include the anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies Humira® (adalimumab), marketed by AbbVie Inc., and Remicade® (infliximab), marketed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and the anti-integrin antibody Entyvio® (vedolizumab), marketed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. Pfizer Inc.’s Xeljanz® (tofacitinib) was the first systemic JAK inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, although other systemic JAK inhibitors are currently in clinical development for IBD including filgotinib (Gilead Sciences, Inc.) and upadacitinib (AbbVie Inc.).
​
Ampreloxetine norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (“NRI”)
If successfully developed and approved, ampreloxetine would be expected to compete predominantly with Northera® (droxidopa) marketed by Lundbeck NA Ltd., and to a lesser extent, midodrine and fludrocortisone which are available as generics. In addition, generic droxidopa is expected to enter the US market in February 2021 following expiration of the orphan drug exclusivity for Northera®.
​
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had 359 employees. Of these employees, 331 were in the US and 28 were non-US. 
​
Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse workforce. We emphasize the importance of character and integrity as much as professional qualifications, and we seek to foster a culture of empowerment where employees have ownership in business outcomes. We strive to keep our people engaged and working collaboratively with an understanding that behaviors that matter are reflected in our Core Values - thinking it through, finding a way, getting it done, and winning together. Our employees are encouraged through many forms of corporate communication such as an open-door policy, all employee meetings, an anonymous online suggestion box, and an Employee Pulse Survey, to ask questions, make suggestions, and provide input. 
​
Diversity and Inclusion
​
We strive to build a culture of diversity and inclusion through our business and human resources practices and policies, and we work to eliminate discrimination and harassment in all of its forms, including related to color, race, sex or gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, pregnancy, caste, disability, ethnicity, national origin or ancestry, religious beliefs, veteran status, uniformed servicemember status, or physical or mental disability. We have both a Diversity & Inclusion Council and a Women’s Leadership Network, which are each Company-sponsored, employee-led groups that aim to improve attraction, retention, development, inclusion, and engagement of a diverse and global workforce.
​
Talent Acquisition and Retention
​
We believe that our philosophy of providing competitive compensation and benefits and our focus on providing opportunities for career growth and development fosters interest from external candidates in Company openings, increases Company employee tenure, and reduces voluntary employee turnover. The global acceptance rate of our employment offers is consistently high. We believe we are successful in our retention efforts because we provide challenging work assignments, cross functional teamwork experiences and career progression supported by new skill building. We invest in employee learning and development by identifying and providing training and development programs, speakers, and other materials and have personnel specifically focused on employee learning and development. Based upon informal and formal feedback, including our Employee Pulse Surveys, management’s relationship with 

19



employees is very good. Because retention of the employee base is key to our business strategy, executive management provides quarterly updates on turnover metrics to our board of directors.
​
Total Rewards
​
We reward our employees beyond a competitive base salary. Our employees also receive cash bonus opportunities, equity incentives, health and wellness benefits and programs, and educational benefits. We strive to offer a competitive total rewards package that is responsive to market needs based upon the specific requirements of the job. Some examples of benefits offered include:

Culture
​
We expect all employees to observe the highest levels of business ethics, while also delivering the highest levels of performance. These expectations are set forth in various documents and forms of communication within and across our Company. The Company encourages employees to speak up and raise questions and concerns promptly about any situation that may violate our Code of Business Conduct, our core values or our policies. We believe that it benefits the entire Company for employees to raise concerns so the Company may consider them carefully and address them properly. We seek to promote an environment that fosters honest communications about matters of conduct related to our business activities, whether that conduct occurs within the Company, involves one of the Company’s contractors, suppliers, consultants, or clients, or involves any other party with a business relationship with the Company. We work to make clear that management is prepared to address any reported violations and to ensure that it is known that any form of retaliation is strictly prohibited. In addition, we have an easily-accessible hotline available to employees wishing to report complaints anonymously.
