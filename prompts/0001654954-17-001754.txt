 TECHNOLOGY
 
 We believe our proprietary implementation of standard Web, IP, Cloud, Mobile and Internet technologies represent a key component of our business model. We believe these technologies and how we deliver them to our customers distinguish our services and products from the services and products offered by our competitors. Our technology infrastructure and virtual network operation center, all of which is built and managed on industry standard computing, storage, data and platforms offers us greater efficiencies. The synergies between Web and Telecommunication protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, XML, SIP and innovations in computing, load balancing, redundancy and high availability of Web and Telecommunications technologies offers us a unique advantage in delivering these services to our customers seamlessly from our data center.
  Our Cloud Telecommunications technology is continuously being enhanced with additional features and software functionality. Our current functionality includes:
    ●
 High-end desktop telephony devices such as Gigabit, PoE, 6 Line Color Phone with 10 programmable buttons and lower end Monochrome 2 Line wall mountable device;

   ●
 Basic Business Telephony Features such as those offered in a traditional private branch exchange (“PBX”) systems like extension dialing, Direct Inward Dialing (DID), Hold/Resume, Music-On-Hold, Call Transfer (Attended and Unattended), Conferencing, Local, Long Distance, Toll-Free and International Dialing, Voicemail, Auto-Attendant and traditional faxing;

   ●

 Our website software platform is continuously being enhanced and is an innovative website-building environment. We continue to invest and develop on our web platform to make it more easy-to-use, enable larger mobile and 3rd party integration features thus enabling our web customers to drive more traffic to their web-sites.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
  We invested $826,000 and $779,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in the research and development of our technologies and data center. The majority of these expenditures were for enhancements to our cloud telecommunications products and services and website development software.
COMPETITION
  Our markets are increasingly competitive. Our competitors include, but are not limited to, cloud telecommunications providers and traditional telephone service providers, application service providers, software vendors, systems integrators, direct providers, and information technology consulting services providers, and cloud service providers.
  Most of these competitors, however, do not offer their own suite of cloud telecommunications services but rather sell third party solutions and offerings. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and longer relationships with customers as well as significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and public relations resources than we do.
  Additionally, should we determine to pursue acquisition opportunities, we may compete with other companies with similar growth strategies. Some of these competitors may be larger and have greater financial resources than we do. Competition for these acquisition targets could also result in increased prices of acquisition targets and a diminished pool of companies available for acquisition.

 There are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. Our proprietary technology does not preclude or inhibit competitors from entering our markets. In particular, we anticipate new entrants will attempt to develop competing products and services or new forums for conducting e-commerce and telecommunications services which could be deemed competition.
  
 Additionally, if e-commerce or Internet based enterprises and telecommunications service providers with more resources and name recognition were to enter our markets, they may redefine our industry and make it difficult for us to compete.
  Expected technology advances associated with the Cloud, increasing use of the Cloud, and new software products are welcome advancements that we believe will broaden the Cloud’s viability. We anticipate that we can compete successfully by relying on our infrastructure, marketing strategies and techniques, systems and procedures, and by adding additional products and services in the future. We believe we can continue the operation of our business by periodic review and revision to our product offerings and marketing approach.
  
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
  Our success depends in part on using and protecting our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. Furthermore, we must conduct our operations without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely upon trade secrets and the know-how and expertise of our key employees. To protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, we rely on a combination of the protections provided by applicable copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements. Although we believe we have taken appropriate steps to protect our intellectual property rights, including requiring employees and third parties who are granted access to our intellectual property to enter into confidentiality agreements, these measures may not be sufficient to protect our rights against third parties. Others may independently develop or otherwise acquire unpatented technologies or products similar or superior to ours.
  We license from third parties certain software and Internet tools which we include in our services and products. If any of these licenses were terminated, we could be required to seek licenses for similar software and Internet tools from other third parties or develop these tools internally. We may not be able to obtain such licenses or develop such tools in a timely fashion, on acceptable terms, or at all.
  Companies participating in the software, Internet technology, and telecommunication industries are frequently involved in disputes relating to intellectual property. We may be required to defend our intellectual property rights against infringement, duplication, discovery and misappropriation by third parties or to defend against third-party claims of infringement. Likewise, disputes may arise in the future with respect to ownership of technology developed by employees who were previously employed by other companies. Any such litigation or disputes could be costly and divert our attention from our business. An adverse determination could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from, or pay royalties to, third parties, or require us to develop appropriate alternative technology. Some or all of these licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we may be unable to develop alternate technology at an acceptable price, or at all. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial position, or results of operations.
  EMPLOYEES
  As of December 31, 2016, we had 53 employees; 50 full-time and 3 part-time, including 4 executives, 15 sales representatives and sales management, 10 engineer and IT support in the development of our cloud services solutions, 17 in operations and customer support, 7 in finance, legal and business development, marketing, and other general administration.

 We make available free of charge on or through our Internet website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities Exchange and Commission (“SEC”).
  You may read and copy this Annual Report at the SEC’s public reference room at 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the public reference room can be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding our filings at www.sec.gov.
  GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
  As a provider of Internet communications services, we are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FCC. Some of these regulatory obligations include contributing to the Federal Universal Service Fund, Telecommunications Relay Service Fund and federal programs related to number administration; providing access to E-911 services; protecting customer information; and porting phone numbers upon a valid customer request. We are also required to pay state and local 911 fees and contribute to state universal service funds in those states that assess Internet voice communications services.
  We are subject to regulations generally applicable to all businesses. We are also subject to an increasing number of laws and regulations directly applicable to telecommunication, Internet access and commerce. The adoption of any such additional laws or regulations may decrease the rate of growth of the Internet, which could in turn decrease the demand for our products and services. Such laws may also increase our costs of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business prospects, financial position or results of operations. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy is uncertain. In particular, one channel we use to initially contact our customers is e-mail. The use of e-mail for this purpose has become the subject of a number of recently adopted and proposed laws and regulations. Future federal or state legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
