 The Company
 Alcoa Corporation, a Delaware corporation, became an independent, publicly traded company on November 1, 2016, following its separation from (the Separation Transaction) its former parent company, Alcoa Inc. (ParentCo). “Regular-way” trading of Alcoa Corporation’s common stock began with the opening of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on November 1, 2016 under the ticker symbol “AA.” Alcoa Corporation’s common stock has a par value of $0.01 per share. Alcoa Corporation’s principal executive office is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In this report, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Alcoa,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Alcoa Corporation and all subsidiaries consolidated for the purposes of its financial statements.
 References herein to “ParentCo” refer to Alcoa Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries through October 31, 2016, at which time it was renamed Arconic Inc. (Arconic) and since has been subsequently renamed Howmet Aerospace Inc. 
 Alcoa Corporation (previously known as Alcoa Upstream Corporation) was formed in Delaware in March 2016 for the purpose of holding ParentCo’s Bauxite, Alumina, Aluminum, Cast Products and Energy businesses, as well as ParentCo’s rolling mill operations in Warrick, Indiana, and 25.1% interest in the Ma’aden Rolling Company in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia). Alcoa Upstream Corporation was renamed Alcoa Corporation in connection with the Separation Transaction. Alcoa Corporation entered into certain agreements with ParentCo to implement the legal and structural separation between the two companies to govern the relationship between Alcoa Corporation and ParentCo after the completion of the Separation Transaction and allocate between Alcoa Corporation and ParentCo various assets, liabilities and obligations, including, among other things, employee benefits, environmental liabilities, intellectual property, and tax-related assets and liabilities. 
 Alcoa is a global industry leader in bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products. The Company is built on a foundation of strong values and operating excellence dating back over 130 years to the world-changing discovery that made aluminum an affordable and vital part of modern life. Since developing the aluminum industry, and throughout our history, our talented Alcoans have followed on with breakthrough innovations and best practices that have led to efficiency, safety, sustainability, and stronger communities wherever we operate.
 Alcoa is a global company with direct and indirect ownership of 28 operating locations across nine countries. The Company’s operations consist of three reportable business segments: Bauxite, Alumina, and Aluminum. The Bauxite and Alumina segments primarily consist of a series of affiliated operating entities held in Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals, a global, unincorporated joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina Limited (described below). The Aluminum segment consists of the Company’s aluminum smelting, casting, and rolling businesses, along with the majority of the energy production business. 
 Aluminum, as an element, is abundant in the earth’s crust, but a multi-step process is required to make aluminum metal. Aluminum metal is produced by refining alumina oxide from bauxite into alumina, which is then smelted into aluminum and can be cast and rolled into many shapes and forms. Aluminum is a commodity traded on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and priced daily. Alumina, an intermediary product, is subject to market pricing through the Alumina Price Index (API). As a result, the prices of both aluminum and alumina are subject to significant volatility and, therefore, influence the operating results of Alcoa. 
 Business Strategy
 In October 2019, the Company announced several strategic actions to drive lower costs and sustainable profitability. These announced actions included a new operating model, realigning the operating portfolio over the following five years through a review of 1.5 million metric tons of smelting capacity and 4 million metric tons of refining capacity, and the sale of non-core assets over the following twelve to eighteen month period with the goal of generating $500 to $1,000. After the portfolio transformation, the Company expects to be the lowest emitter of carbon dioxide among all global aluminum companies, per ton of emissions in both smelting and refining, and aims to move its aluminum portfolio to a first quartile cost position. In addition, Alcoa anticipates that up to 85 percent of its smelting portfolio will be powered by renewable energy, building upon the Company’s existing sustainability profile and in support of its strategic priority to “advance sustainably.”
 The new operating model, effective November 1, 2019, resulted in a leaner, more integrated, operator-centric organization. With a streamlined executive team which eliminated the business unit structure, the model increased connectivity between 
 1


the Company’s operations and leadership, consolidated sales, procurement and other commercial capabilities at an enterprise level, and reduced overhead. The Company realized $60 in annual savings beginning in the second quarter of 2020.
 For the portfolio review, the Company placed 1.5 million metric tons of aluminum smelting capacity and 4 million metric tons of alumina refining capacity under review, considering opportunities for significant improvement, potential curtailments, closures, or divestitures. In 2020, the Company progressed its review of smelting and refining production capacity. See Part II Item 7 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under caption Business Update.
 The Company met the target range for our non-core asset sales through the sale of our hazardous waste treatment business in Gum Springs, Arkansas that closed in January 2020 and our announced agreement to sell our Warrick rolling mill business in a sale expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions.  
 The Company’s strategic priority to “advance sustainably” includes maintaining the Company’s social license to operate, reducing risks and improving profitability through product differentiation. In 2020, the Company launched the world’s first low-carbon alumina brand, achieved Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) certification for additional operating assets, and obtained ASI’s Chain of Custody certification for marketing our products.
 Joint Ventures
 Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC)
 AWAC is an unincorporated global joint venture between Alcoa Corporation and Alumina Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. AWAC consists of a number of affiliated entities that own, operate or have an interest in bauxite mines and alumina refineries, as well as an aluminum smelter, in seven countries. Alcoa Corporation owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these entities, directly or indirectly, with such entities being consolidated by Alcoa Corporation for financial reporting purposes. The scope of AWAC generally includes the mining of bauxite and other aluminous ores; the refining, production, and sale of smelter grade and non-metallurgical alumina; and the production of certain primary aluminum products. 
 Alcoa provides the operating management for AWAC, which is subject to direction provided by the Strategic Council of AWAC. The Strategic Council consists of five members, three of whom are appointed by Alcoa (of which one is the Chair), and two of whom are appointed by Alumina Limited (of which one is the Deputy Chair). Matters are decided by a majority vote with certain matters requiring approval by at least 80% of the members, including: changes to the scope of AWAC; changes in the dividend policy; equity calls in aggregate greater than $1,000 in any year; sales of all or a majority of the AWAC assets; loans from AWAC companies to Alcoa or Alumina Limited; certain acquisitions, divestitures, expansions, curtailments or closures; certain related-party transactions; financial derivatives, hedges or swap transactions; a decision by AWAC entities to file for insolvency; and changes to pricing formula in certain offtake agreements which may be entered into between AWAC entities and Alcoa or Alumina Limited.

Exclusivity
 Under the terms of their joint venture agreements, Alcoa and Alumina Limited have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, AWAC is their exclusive vehicle for their investments, operations or participation in the bauxite and alumina business, and they will not compete with AWAC in those businesses. In the event of a change of control of either Alcoa or Alumina Limited, this exclusivity and non-compete restriction will terminate, and the partners will then have opportunities to unilaterally pursue bauxite or alumina projects outside of or within AWAC, subject to certain conditions provided in the Amended and Restated Charter of the Strategic Council.
Equity Calls
 The cash flow of AWAC and borrowings are the preferred sources of funding for the needs of AWAC. An equity call can be made on 30 days’ notice, subject to certain limitations, in the event the aggregate annual capital budget of AWAC requires an equity contribution from Alcoa and Alumina Limited.
Dividend Policy
 AWAC will generally be required to distribute at least 50% of the prior calendar quarter’s net income of each AWAC entity, and certain AWAC entities will also be required to pay a distribution every three months equal to the amount of available cash above specified thresholds and subject to the forecast cash needs of the AWAC entity. 
Leveraging Policy
 Debt of AWAC is subject to a limit of 30% of total capital (defined as the sum of debt (net of cash) plus any minority interest plus shareholder equity). The AWAC joint venture has raised a limited amount of debt to fund growth projects as permitted under Alcoa’s revolving credit line, and in accordance with the joint venture partnership agreements. 
Saudi Arabia Joint Venture
 In December 2009, Alcoa entered into a joint venture with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Ma’aden), which was formed by the government of Saudi Arabia to develop its mineral resources and create a fully integrated aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia. Ma’aden is listed on the Saudi Stock Exchange (Tadawul). The complex includes a bauxite mine with a capacity of 4 million dry metric tons per year; an alumina refinery with a capacity of 1.8 million metric tons per year (mtpy); an aluminum smelter with a capacity of ingot, slab and billet of 740,000 mtpy; and a rolling mill with a capacity of 460,000 mtpy. 
 The joint venture is currently comprised of two entities: the Ma’aden Bauxite and Alumina Company (MBAC) and the Ma’aden Aluminium Company (MAC). Ma’aden owns a 74.9% interest in the MBAC and MAC joint venture. Alcoa owns a 25.1% interest in MAC, which holds the smelter; AWAC holds a 25.1% interest in MBAC, which holds the mine and refinery. In June 2019, the joint venture agreement was amended, transferring Alcoa’s 25.1% interest in the Ma’aden Rolling Company (MRC), which was previously part of the joint venture, to Ma’aden, among other things. See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The refinery and smelter are located within the Ras Al Khair industrial zone on the east coast of Saudi Arabia. 
 Ma’aden and Alcoa Corporation have put and call options, respectively, whereby Ma’aden can require Alcoa Corporation to purchase from Ma’aden, or Alcoa Corporation can require Ma’aden to sell to Alcoa Corporation, a 14.9% interest in MBAC and MAC at the then fair market value. These options, if exercised, must be exercised for the full 14.9% interest in both entities. The amended joint venture agreement defines October 1, 2021 as the date after which Ma’aden and Alcoa Corporation can exercise their put and call options, respectively. The amended joint venture agreement further outlines that these options are exercisable for a period of six months after October 1, 2021.
 The amended joint venture agreement also defines October 1, 2021 as the date after which Alcoa Corporation is permitted to sell all of its shares in both MBAC and MAC collectively, for which Ma’aden has a right of first refusal. Prior to this date, Ma’aden and Alcoa Corporation may not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of, pledge, or encumber any interests in the joint venture. Under the amended joint venture agreement, upon the occurrence of an unremedied event of default by Alcoa Corporation, Ma’aden may purchase, or, upon the occurrence of an unremedied event of default by Ma’aden, Alcoa Corporation may sell, its interest in the joint venture for consideration that varies depending on the time of the default.

Manicouagan owns and operates the 335 megawatt McCormick hydroelectric project, which is located on the Manicouagan River in the Province of Québec, Canada. Alcoa owns 40% of the joint venture. 
 Bauxite
 This segment consists of the Company’s global bauxite mining operations. Bauxite is the principal raw material used to produce alumina and contains various aluminum hydroxide minerals, the most important of which are gibbsite and boehmite. Bauxite is refined using the Bayer process, the principal industrial chemical process for refining bauxite to produce alumina, a compound of aluminum and oxygen that is the raw material used by smelters to produce aluminum metal. Bauxite is Alcoa’s basic raw material input for its alumina refining process. The Company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to AWAC, located in the countries listed in the table below, as well as pursuant to both long-term and short-term contracts and mining leases. Tons of bauxite are reported on a zero-moisture basis as dry metric tons unless otherwise stated. 
 Alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina and sells the remainder to third parties. In 2020, Alcoa-operated mines produced 41.1 million dmt and mines operated by partnerships in which Alcoa and AWAC have equity interests produced 6.9 million dmt on a proportional equity basis, for a total Company bauxite production of 48.0 million dmt.

Based on the terms of its bauxite supply contracts, the amount of bauxite AWAC purchases from its minority-owned joint ventures MRN and CBG differ from its proportional equity in those mines. Therefore, in 2020, Alcoa had access to 48.7 million dmt of production from its portfolio of bauxite interests and sold 6.5 million dmt of bauxite to third parties; 42.2 million dmt of bauxite was delivered to Alcoa and AWAC refineries.
 The Company aims to grow its third-party bauxite sales business. In December 2016, the Government of Western Australia granted permission to Alcoa’s majority-owned subsidiary, AofA, to export up to 2.5 million dmt per year of bauxite for five years to third-party customers. Supply to third-party customers beyond 2021 will require approval from the Government of Western Australia. The primary customer base for third-party bauxite is located in Asia, particularly in China. 
 Bauxite Resource and Reserve Development Guidelines
 The Company has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in many cases more than 15 years from the date of this report. For purposes of evaluating the amount of bauxite that will be available to supply its refineries, the Company considers both estimates of bauxite resources as well as calculated bauxite reserves. “Bauxite resources” are deposits for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence (based on the amount of exploration sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes), such that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. “Bauxite reserves” represent the part of resource deposits that can be economically mined to supply alumina refineries, and include diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out to define the reserves, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. Alcoa employs a conventional approach (including additional drilling with successive tightening of the drilling grid) with customized techniques to define and characterize its various bauxite deposit types allowing the Company to confidently establish the extent of its bauxite resources and their ultimate conversion to reserves.
 Alcoa has adopted best practice guidelines for bauxite reserve and resource classification at its operating bauxite mines. Alcoa’s reserves are declared in accordance with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code guidelines. The reported ore reserves set forth in the table below are those that we estimated could be extracted economically with current technology and in current market conditions. We do not use a price for bauxite, alumina or aluminum to determine our bauxite reserves. The primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the feed specifications required by the receiving alumina refinery. More specifically, reserves are set based on the chemical composition of the bauxite in order to minimize bauxite processing cost and maximize refinery economics for each individual refinery. The primary specifications that are important to this analysis are the “available alumina” content of the bauxite, which is the amount of alumina extractable from bauxite using the Bayer process, and “reactive silica” content of the bauxite, which is the amount of silica that is reactive within the Bayer process. Each alumina refinery will have a target specification for these parameters, but may receive bauxite within a range that allows blending in stockpiles to achieve the receiving refinery’s target.
 In addition to these chemical specifications, several other ore reserve design factors have been applied to differentiate bauxite reserves from other mineralized material. The contours of the bauxite reserves are designed using parameters such as available alumina content cutoff grade, reactive silica cutoff grade, ore density, overburden thickness, ore thickness and mine access considerations. These parameters are generally determined by using infill drilling or geological modeling. Further, our mining locations utilize annual in-fill drilling or geological modeling programs designed to progressively upgrade the reserve and resource classification of their bauxite based on the above-described factors.
 The following table only includes the amount of proven and probable reserves controlled by the Company. While the level of reserves may appear low in relation to annual production levels, they are consistent with historical levels of reserves for the Company’s mining locations and consistent with the Company reserves strategy. Given the Company’s extensive bauxite resources, the abundant supply of bauxite globally, and the length of the Company’s rights to bauxite, it is not cost-effective to establish bauxite reserves that reflect the total size of the bauxite resources available to the Company. Rather, bauxite resources are upgraded annually to reserves as needed by the location. Detailed assessments are progressively undertaken within a proposed mining area and mine activity is then planned to achieve a uniform quality in the supply of blended feedstock to the relevant refinery. Alcoa believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future.

Alumina
 This segment consists of the Company’s worldwide refining system, which processes bauxite into alumina. Alcoa’s alumina sales are made to customers all over the world and are typically priced by reference to published spot market prices. The Company’s largest customer for smelter grade alumina is its own aluminum smelters, which in 2020 accounted for approximately 31% of its total alumina shipments. A small portion of the alumina is sold to third-party customers who process it into industrial chemical products. This segment also includes AWAC’s 25.1% share of MBAC.
 The Company primarily sells alumina through fixed price spot sales and contracts containing two pricing components: (1) the API price basis, and (2) a negotiated adjustment basis that takes into account various factors, including freight, quality, customer location, and market conditions. In 2020, approximately 95% of the Company’s smelter grade alumina shipments to third parties were sold on a fixed price spot basis or adjusted API price basis. 
 Alcoa’s alumina refining facilities and its worldwide alumina capacity stated in metric tons per year (mtpy) are shown in the following table:

Alcoa Corporation Consolidated Capacity represents our share of production from these facilities. For facilities wholly-owned by AWAC entities, Alcoa takes 100% of the production.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of December 31, 2020, Alcoa had approximately 214,000 mtpy of idle capacity relative to total Alcoa consolidated capacity of 12,759,000 mtpy. The 214,000 mtpy of idle capacity is at the Poços de Caldas facility as a result of the full curtailment of the Poços de Caldas smelter. 
 In October 2019, the Company announced a five-year review of our production assets that includes a range of potential outcomes for these facilities, including significantly improved competitive positioning, curtailment, closure, or divestiture. The review includes 4 million metric tons of global refining capacity, of which 2,305,000 mtpy of capacity has been permanently closed since the announced review (Point Comfort refinery, Texas). See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
 Aluminum
 This segment currently consists of (i) the Company’s worldwide smelting and casthouse system, (ii) a portfolio of energy assets in Brazil, Canada, and the United States, and (iii) a rolling mill located at Warrick Operations (Warrick Rolling Mill), an integrated aluminum manufacturing site near Evansville, Indiana (Warrick Operations) in the United States. The smelting operations produce molten primary aluminum, which is then formed by the casting operations into either common alloy ingot (e.g., t-bar, sow, standard ingot) or into value-add ingot products (e.g., foundry, billet, rod, and slab). The energy assets supply power to external customers in Brazil, and, to a lesser extent, in the United States, and internal customers within the Aluminum segment (Baie Comeau (Canada) smelter and Warrick (Indiana) smelter and rolling mill) and the Alumina segment (Brazilian refineries). The Company has entered into an agreement to sell the Warrick Rolling Mill, which produces aluminum sheet primarily for the production of aluminum cans, to Kaiser Aluminum Corporation (Kaiser). The sale is 
 9


expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. This segment also includes Alcoa’s 25.1% share of MAC, the smelting joint venture company in Saudi Arabia.
 Smelting and Casting Operations
 Contracts for primary aluminum vary widely in duration, from multi-year supply contracts to spot purchases. Pricing for primary aluminum products is typically comprised of three components: (i) the published LME aluminum price for commodity grade P1020 aluminum, (ii) the published regional premium applicable to the delivery locale and (iii) a negotiated product premium that accounts for factors such as shape and alloy. 
 Alcoa’s primary aluminum facilities and its global smelting capacity stated in metric tons per year (mtpy) are shown in the following table:

The Poços de Caldas facility is a casthouse and does not include a smelter.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 831,000 mtpy of idle smelting capacity relative to total Alcoa consolidated capacity of 2,993,000 mtpy. The idle capacity includes 230,000 mtpy at the Intalco smelter in Ferndale, Washington which was curtailed in 2020 and 49,000 mtpy of earlier-curtailed capacity. The Alumar and Wenatchee smelters have been fully curtailed since 2015, and the Portland smelter has 30,000 mtpy of idle capacity. The smelter at Warrick Operations, which is dedicated to supplying the Warrick Rolling Mill, has 108,000 mtpy of idle capacity.
 The Company’s announced five-year review of our production assets includes 1.5 million metric tons of smelting capacity. The curtailment of the Intalco smelter reduced the target by 279,000 metric tons.
 On October 8, 2020, the Company made the decision to curtail the 228,000 metric tons of uncompetitive annual smelting capacity at the San Ciprián smelter in Spain. The decision followed a four-month consultation process with the Spanish Works Council and unsuccessful negotiations during a potential sale process. On October 4, 2020, the labor force at both the refinery and the aluminum facilities at San Ciprián initiated a strike. Following Alcoa’s announcement to curtail the San Ciprián smelter, the workers’ representatives challenged the collective dismissal process in a legal proceeding before the 
 10


High Court of Justice of Galicia, which ruled in favor of the workers on December 17, 2020. As a result, the Company suspended its plans to curtail the San Ciprián smelter. On January 22, 2021, the Company reached agreement with the workers’ representatives to suspend the strike. As part of the agreement, the Company agreed to conduct a sale process to sell the smelter to a Spanish government owned entity.
 See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Rolling Operations
 The Aluminum segment’s rolled products business consists solely of the Company’s rolling mill operations in Warrick, Indiana, which produces aluminum sheet. Alcoa’s rolled products business has the capability of participating in several market segments, including beverage can sheet, food can sheet, lithographic sheet, and industrial products. The term Rigid Container Sheet (RCS) is commonly used for both beverage and food can sheet. RCS includes the material used to produce the body of beverage containers (body stock), the lid of beverage containers (end stock and tab stock), the material to produce food can body and lids (food stock), and the material to produce aluminum bottles (bottle stock) and bottle closures (closure sheet). 
 In 2020, our Warrick Rolling Mill produced and sold 305,900 metric tons of RCS and industrial products to customers in North America. The majority of its sales were coated RCS products (food stock, beverage end and tab stock). Can sheet demand is a function of consumer demand for beverages and food in aluminum packaging, and seasonal increases in can sheet sales are generally expected in the second and third quarters of the year. 
 On November 30, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Warrick Rolling Mill located at Warrick Operations, to Kaiser for total consideration of approximately $670, which includes $587 in cash and the assumption of $83 in other postretirement benefit liabilities. The sale is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 Energy Facilities and Sources
 Energy comprises approximately 21% of the Company’s total alumina refining production costs. Electric power comprises approximately 26% of the Company’s primary aluminum production costs.
 Electricity markets are regional and are limited in size by physical and regulatory constraints, including the physical inability to transport electricity efficiently over long distances, the design of the electric grid, including interconnections, and the regulatory structure imposed by various federal and state entities.
 Electricity contracts may be short-term (real-time or day ahead) or years in duration, and contracts can be executed for immediate delivery or years in advance. Pricing may be fixed, indexed to an underlying fuel source or other index such as LME, cost-based or based on regional market pricing. In 2020, Alcoa generated approximately 10% of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchased the remainder under long-term arrangements.
 The following table sets forth the electricity generation capacity and 2020 generation of facilities in which Alcoa Corporation has an ownership interest. See also the Joint Ventures section above.
 
 
Country | Facility | Alcoa Corporation Consolidated Capacity (MW) | | 2020 Generation (MWh)

United States | Warrick | | 657 | | 3,760,925
TOTAL | | | 1,278 | | 8,427,873

 
The figures in this table are presented in megawatts (MW) and megawatt hours (MWh), respectively.
 Each facility listed above generates hydroelectric power except the Warrick facility, which generates substantially all of the power used by the Warrick smelting and rolling facilities from the co-located Warrick power plant using coal purchased from third parties at nearby coal reserves. During 2020, approximately 31% of the capacity from the Warrick power plant was sold into the market under its current operating permits. Alcoa Power Generating Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, also owns 
 11


certain Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-regulated transmission assets in Indiana, Tennessee, New York, and Washington.
 The consolidated capacity of the Brazilian energy facilities shown above in megawatts (MW) is the assured energy, representing approximately 52% of hydropower plant nominal capacity. Since May 2015 (after curtailment of the Poços de Caldas and São Luís smelters in Brazil), the excess generation capacity from the Brazilian hydroelectric facilities has been sold into the market.
 Manicouagan Power Limited Partnership (Manicouagan) is a joint venture between affiliates of Alcoa Corporation and Hydro-Québec. Manicouagan owns and operates the 335 megawatt McCormick hydroelectric project, which is located on the Manicouagan River in the Province of Québec. 
 
Below is an overview of our external energy for our smelters and refineries.

 | Electricity | Natural Gas 
North America | Québec, Canada The three smelters in Québec purchase all or a majority of their electricity under contracts with Hydro-Québec that expire on December 31, 2029. The smelter located in Baie Comeau also purchases approximately one-quarter of its power needs from a 40% owned hydroelectric generating company, Manicouagan Power Limited Partnership. Wenatchee, Washington This smelter is served by a contract with Chelan County Public Utility District No. 1 (Chelan PUD) under which Alcoa receives 26% of the hydropower output of Chelan PUD’s Rocky Reach and Rock Island dams. The Wenatchee smelter has been fully curtailed since 2015. Intalco, Washington Prior to the curtailment of the Intalco smelter, all power requirements of the smelter were purchased from the market. Massena, New York (Massena West) The Massena West smelter in New York receives power from the New York Power Authority (NYPA) pursuant to a contract between Alcoa and NYPA that will expire in March 2026. | Alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources, including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers. Contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) price. 
Australia | Portland This smelter purchases power from the National Electricity Market (NEM) variable spot market. The smelter has fixed for floating swap contracts with AGL Energy Ltd. in order to manage exposure to the variable energy rates from the NEM. The swap contracts will expire on July 31, 2021. | Western Australia AofA uses gas to co-generate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the Kwinana, Pinjarra and Wagerup refineries. In 2015, AofA secured a significant portion of gas supplies to 2032, covering more than 95% of the refineries’ gas requirements through 2023 and decreasing percentages thereafter. In 2020, AofA contracted for additional gas supplies starting in 2024. On a combined basis, these gas supply arrangements are expected to cover more than 80% of the refineries’ gas requirements through 2027.
Europe | San Ciprián, Spain Alcoa’s smelter at San Ciprián, Spain, purchases electricity under a bilateral spot power contract that expires June 30, 2021. Alcoa participates in a demand response program in Spain, agreeing to reduce usage of electricity for a specific period of time, in return for compensation, which allows the utility or grid operator to divert electricity during times of peak demand. These rights are allocated through an auction process, the last occurring in December 2019, where Alcoa secured 325MW of interruptibility rights for the period of January to June 2020; this program was not in effect for the second half of 2020. Lista and Mosjøen, Norway Beginning in 2017, Alcoa entered into several long-term power purchase agreements, which secured approximately 50% of the necessary power for the Norwegian smelters for the period of 2020 to 2035. The remaining 50% is currently purchased under short-term contracts. Financial compensation of the indirect carbon emissions costs passed through in the electricity bill is received in accordance with EU Commission Guidelines and the Norwegian compensation regime. Iceland Landsvirkjun, the Icelandic national power company, supplies competitively priced electricity to Alcoa’s Fjarðaál smelter in eastern Iceland under a 40-year power contract, which will expire in 2047 with price renegotiation effective from 2027. | Spain In 2020, natural gas was supplied to the San Ciprián, Spain, alumina refinery pursuant to three supply contracts with BP, Endesa and Naturgy; the BP and Endesa contracts expired during 2020. In 2021, the refinery’s natural gas requirements will be supplied pursuant to two supply contracts, with Naturgy expiring in June 2021 and December 2021, respectively, and one supply contract with UFG (ENI group) expiring in December 2021.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
 Generally, materials are purchased from third-party suppliers under competitively priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements. The Company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available.
 For each metric ton (mt) of alumina produced, Alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs (approximate range across relevant facilities):
 
 
Raw Material | Units | Consumption per mt of Alumina 
-------------------------+-------+----------------------------------------------
Bauxite | mt | 2.2 – 3.6 
Caustic soda | kg | 60 – 100 
Electricity | kWh | 200 to 260 total consumed (0 to 230 imported)
Fuel oil and natural gas | GJ | 6.2 – 12.2 
Lime (CaO) | kg | 6 – 60 

 
For each metric ton of aluminum produced, Alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs (approximate range across relevant facilities):
 
 
Raw Material | Units | Consumption per mt of Primary Aluminum
------------------------+-------+---------------------------------------
Alumina | mt | 1.92 ± 0.02 
Aluminum fluoride | kg | 17.1 ± 5.0 
Calcined petroleum coke | mt | 0.37 ± 0.05 
Cathode blocks | mt | 0.005 ± 0.002 
Electricity | kWh | 13,100 – 16,500 
Liquid pitch | mt | 0.10 ± 0.03 
Natural gas | mcf | 3.0 ± 1.0 

 
Certain aluminum produced includes alloying materials. Because of the number of different types of elements that can be used to produce various alloys, providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful. With the exception of a very small number of internally used products, Alcoa produces its aluminum alloys in adherence to an Aluminum Association (of which Alcoa is an active member) standard, which uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types. In general, each alloy type has a major alloying element other than aluminum but will also include lesser amounts of other constituents. 
 
Competition
 Alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of the aluminum supply chain in which it competes. Our business segments operate in close proximity to our broad, worldwide customer base, enabling us to meet customer demand in key markets in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and China. Alcoa’s competitive position depends, in part, on the Company’s access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries, in particular for its aluminum smelting operations.
 13


We compete with a variety of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies in all major markets across the aluminum supply chain. Competitors include bauxite miners who supply to the third-party bauxite market, active alumina suppliers, refiners and producers, commodity traders, aluminum producers, RCS producers, and producers of alternative materials such as steel, titanium, copper, carbon fiber, composites, plastic and glass.
 We continue to enhance the sustainability of our products and are well positioned to add value for our customers by offering a family of sustainable products. By having an integrated aluminum value chain, we are able to deliver our SustanaTM product line, which includes: EcoSource™, the world’s first and only low-carbon alumina brand; Ecolum™, a primary aluminum with no more than 4.0 mt of CO2e per ton of aluminum produced, including indirect and direct emissions, from the entire production process; and EcoDura™, an aluminum product produced with a minimum of 50% recycled content, using significantly less energy than what it takes to produce only virgin aluminum. These products position us to offer a sustainable option to our customers interested in improving their environmental footprint.  
 Competitive advantages specific to each business segment are detailed below.
 
Bauxite:
 We are among the world’s largest bauxite miners, with best practices in efficient mining operations and sustainability. The majority of bauxite mined globally is converted to alumina for the production of aluminum. Alcoa’s bauxite is used both to supply internal consumption in our alumina refineries as well as in sales through our third-party bauxite business to meet growing demand. The third-party market for metallurgical grade bauxite is growing quickly as global demand for bauxite increases—particularly in China.
 Our principal competitors in the third-party bauxite market include Rio Tinto and multiple suppliers from Guinea, Australia, Indonesia, and Brazil, among other countries. We compete largely based on bauxite quality, price and proximity to customers, as well as long-term bauxite resources in strategic bauxite mine locations, including Australia, Brazil, and Guinea, which is home to the world’s largest reserves of high-quality metallurgical grade bauxite. Our high-quality bauxite is mined responsibly and reliably, thereby reducing supply chain risk for any downstream user.
 Alumina:
 We are the world’s largest alumina producer outside of China and operate competitive, efficient assets across our refining, aluminum smelting, and casting portfolios. The alumina market is global and highly competitive, with many active suppliers, producers, and commodity traders. Our main competitors in the third-party alumina market are Aluminum Corporation of China, South32 Limited, Hangzhou Jinjiang Group, Rio Tinto and Norsk Hydro ASA. In recent years, there has been significant growth in alumina refining in China and India. The majority of our product is sold in the form of smelter grade alumina. 
 Key factors influencing competition in the alumina market include cost position, price, reliability of bauxite supply, quality and proximity to customers and end markets. We had an average cost position in the first quartile of global alumina production in 2020, in part attributable to our deep technical expertise and sophistication in refining technology and process automation. Our refineries are strategically located next to low cost bauxite mines, and our alumina refineries are tuned to maximize efficiency with the bauxite qualities from these internal mines. In addition to these refining efficiencies, vertical integration affords a stable and consistent long-term supply of bauxite to our refining portfolio.
 Aluminum:
 In our Aluminum segment, competition is dependent upon the type of product we are selling. 
 The market for primary aluminum is global, and demand for aluminum varies widely from region to region. We compete with commodity traders, such as Glencore, Trafigura, J. Aron and Gerald Group, and aluminum producers such as Emirates Global Aluminum, Norsk Hydro, Rio Tinto, Century Aluminum, Vedanta Aluminum Ltd., and United Company RUSAL Plc.
 The aluminum industry is highly competitive. Several of the most critical competitive factors in our industry are product quality, production costs (including source and cost of energy), price, access and proximity to raw materials, customers and end markets, timeliness of delivery, customer service (including technical support), product innovation, and breadth of offerings. Where aluminum products compete with other materials, the diverse characteristics of aluminum are also a significant factor, particularly its light weight, strength and recyclability.
 14


The strength of our position in the primary aluminum market is largely attributable to: our integrated supply chain; long-term energy arrangements, which allow us to continually reduce production costs; the ability of our casthouses to provide customers with a diverse product portfolio in terms of shapes and alloys; and our decreasing demand for fossil fuels, as approximately 78% of the aluminum smelting portfolio operated by the Company ran on renewable power sources in 2020. The Company intends to continue to focus on optimizing capacity utilization. 
 
Patents, Trade Secrets and Trademarks
 The Company believes that its domestic and international patent, trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage. The Company’s rights under its intellectual property, as well as the technology and products made and sold under them, are important to the Company as a whole and, to varying degrees, important to each business segment. Alcoa’s business as a whole is not, however, materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret or trademark.

Government Regulations and Environmental Matters
 
Alcoa’s global operations subject it to compliance with various types of government laws and regulations which often provide discretion to government authorities and could be interpreted, applied, or modified in ways to make the Company’s operations or compliance activities more costly. These laws and regulations include those relating to health and safety (including those promulgated in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), competition, data privacy and security, environmental compliance, and trade, such as tariffs or other import or export restrictions that may increase the cost of raw material or cross-border shipments and impact our ability to do business with certain countries or individuals. For a discussion of the risks associated with certain applicable laws and regulations, see Part I Item 1A of this Form 10-K. For additional information on the financial impact of trade regulations, see Part II Item 7 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under caption Business Update—Section 232 Tariffs.
 Alcoa is subject to extensive federal, state/provincial and local environmental laws and regulations, in the U.S. and abroad, including those relating to the release or discharge of materials into the air, water and soil, waste management, pollution prevention measures, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials, the exposure of persons to hazardous materials, and greenhouse gas emissions. We participate in environmental assessments and cleanups at approximately 60 locations, which include currently owned or operated facilities and adjoining properties, previously owned or operated facilities and adjoining properties, and waste sites, such as U.S. Superfund (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)) sites. In 2020, capital expenditures for new or expanded facilities for environmental control were approximately $90 and approximately $135 is expected in 2021. See Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K in Note S to the Consolidated Financial Statements under caption Contingencies for additional information. 
 Human Capital Resources
 Our core values – Act with Integrity, Operate with Excellence, and Care for People – guide us as a company, including our approach to human capital management. We are on a mission to strengthen our culture where people are treated with dignity and respect, and our core values drive everyday decisions. We believe that our people are our greatest asset. The success and growth of our business depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop and retain a diverse population of talented, qualified and highly skilled employees at all levels of our organization, including the individuals who comprise our global workforce, our executive officers and other key personnel.
 Our Company policies, including the Code of Conduct, Harassment and Bullying Free Workplace Policy, and EHS Vision, Values, Mission, and Policy, support our mission to advance our Company culture and core values. Alcoa maintains a Human Rights Policy that applies globally to the Company, its partnerships and other business associates, and is committed to abiding by international human rights principles encompassed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the United Nations Global Compact, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Employees
 As of December 31, 2020, Alcoa had approximately 12,900 employees in 16 countries. Approximately 9,200 of our global employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with certain unions and varying expiration dates, including approximately 1,900 employees in the U.S., 1,700 employees in Europe, 1,400 employees in Canada, 1,600 employees in South America, and 2,600 employees in Australia. Approximately 1,700 U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement in place with the United Steelworkers (USW). There are also U.S. collective bargaining agreements in place, with varying expiration dates, with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) and the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers (IBEW).
 In 2020, the Company completed the sale of its Gum Springs waste treatment facility in Arkansas and the curtailment of the Intalco smelter in Ferndale, Washington, which reduced the number of total employees by approximately 700.
 Safety and Health 
 The safety and health of our employees, contractors, temporary workers, and visitors are our top priorities and key to our ability to attract and retain talent. We aspire to work safely, all the time, everywhere. We strive to foster a culture of hazard and risk awareness, the effective understanding and use of our safe systems of work, proactive incident reporting, and knowledge sharing to attain this goal. 
 Our systems are designed to prevent loss of life and serious injury at our locations. Our safety programs and systems include rigorous safety standards and controls, periodic risk-based audits, a formal and standardized process for investigating fatal and all serious injury potential incidents, management of critical risks and safety hazards, and efforts to eliminate hazards or implement controls to prevent and mitigate risks. 
 We document any incident that has the potential to cause a serious injury, and strive to maintain a culture of speaking up, where incidents are reported and ideas are shared. We have operating standards based on human performance, which teaches employees how to anticipate and recognize situations where errors are likely to occur, in order to allow us to predict, reduce, manage, and prevent fatalities and injuries. We integrate our temporary workers, contractors, and visitors into our safety programs and data through our OneAlcoa: United for Safety initiative.
 Operational employees are required to take safety and health training that is determined by their specific roles, tasks, areas where they work, job functions and responsibilities. In 2020, all salaried employees were required to include a safety objective in their annual performance objectives. We believe having an individual safety objective empowers our employees to be more involved in creating our safety culture. To further support this, we have included a safety metric focused on reducing fatalities and serious injuries in our annual incentive program for the past several years.
 See Part II Item 7 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under caption Business Update – Coronavirus for additional information on the health and safety protocols implemented by the Company for the protection of its workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Inclusion, Diversity, and Equality
 We seek to provide a safe, respectful, and inclusive workplace that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate and makes Alcoa a desired employer. We seek to hire local candidates when possible and continue to focus on the diversity of our candidate pool. 
 We remain focused on advancing inclusion, diversity, and equality. As of December 31, 2020, women comprised approximately 15.6% of our global workforce. We are committed to achieving gender balance across Alcoa and are defining long-term actions to improve diversity and inclusion. To support these efforts, for the past several years, we have included a metric in our annual incentive plan focused on increasing the gender diversity of our global workforce. 
 In October 2020, we launched our Global Inclusion & Diversity Council of diverse leaders across the Company to support the execution of our inclusion and diversity strategy aimed at building an inclusive culture where employees feel valued, empowered, and respected. We offer several global resources and inclusion groups for our employees, including: AWARE – Alcoans working actively for racial-ethnic equality; EAGLE, our LGBT+ Equality inclusion group; and AWN – Alcoa Women’s Network.
