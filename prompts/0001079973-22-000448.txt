ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
 
MediXall Group, Inc. (OTCQB:MDXL) is an innovation-driven technology company purposefully designed and structured around delivering products and services to help consumers learn, decide, and pay for healthcare in ways that complement relationships with trusted doctors. The mission of MediXall Group is to revolutionize the medical industry--improve communication, provide better technology and support services, and provide more efficient, cost-effective healthcare for the consumer.
 
We started MediXall because we saw the clear systemic flaws in the American health care system. We believe that these flaws made it too expensive and too inconvenient for far too many Americans to obtain quality health care.
 
Partially because of inefficiency combined with the effect of COVID-19, America’s health care system now consumes 19.7% of U.S. GDP, with health spending increasing 9.7% to reach $4.1 trillion in 2020 according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Per capita, America spends much more on health care than any other country in the world—42% more than the next closest country Switzerland, and 92.5% more than the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) country average.
 
A crisis looms because the health care spending growth rate exceeds the growth rate of the general economy. If the 5.4% CMS projected U.S. health care spending growth rate continues, healthcare spending will consume over 20% of U.S. GDP by 2028, crowding out other equally important sectors such as education, infrastructure and the nation’s defense.
 
Even with this looming crisis, U.S. healthcare market remains opaque and highly fragmented for consumers. Even simple healthcare transactions, such as finding a doctor, scheduling routine procedures or filling a prescription at an affordable price, can be difficult—resulting in inefficiency and higher prices for consumers and the healthcare system.
 
Recognizing that these trends are not sustainable, MediXall is focused on solutions to these problems. This is what led to the development and launch of Health Karma. This is a robust digital healthcare platform providing a single place for healthcare consumers to turn for personalized information, programs, and resources needed to understand, access, and manage their health and well-being. Focusing on the individual, Health Karma™ gives people information they need to select the right doctor or the right care from the start, and provide ongoing support, such as telehealth solutions, saving money for companies and their employees, while also improving care.
 
From day one, our vision has been to take complexity out of healthcare. Recognizing this was no small task, we began executing our plan to build an online platform for the consumer to learn, obtain and pay for healthcare without intruding on the trusting relationships with doctors. MediXall launched the first generation of our product in 2019, under the name MediXall.com. Our initial assumption was that because so many were paying more out of pocket with high deductibles, they would respond favorably to a service that would save them money in paying for services in ways similar to those provided by Priceline or Expedia.
 
In our controlled launch of MediXall.com we found that consumers’ greatest challenges were understanding healthcare costs, health insurance, and the navigation necessary to find the right service providers and doctors. This was due to the average consumer not understanding the basic language of healthcare and health insurance, which makes decision-making on treatments, products, and services difficult
 
We recognized the key was to shift healthcare from a one-size-fits all model to a more personalized experience built around each individual—reducing and even removing layers of complexity that health insurance brings. So instead of investing large amount on marketing our MediXall.com solution, we decided to develop a more comprehensive product suite that empowers consumers with the tools and resources to navigate the confusion of the healthcare system.
 
With Health Karma we have created a unique membership model that provides consumers with convenient and affordable access to best-in-class care, whenever and wherever, while driving down overall healthcare costs. We provide our members access to licensed healthcare providers across a wide and growing spectrum of care through $0 copay virtual primary, urgent, and behavioral care, as well as significant discounts to prescriptions, dental care, eye care, hearing and medical equipment. For employers, our Health Karma membership offers a comprehensive way for them to offer supplemental health benefits to all of their employees, including part-time and gig workers who typically are not eligible for benefits.

The platform was purpose-built to address the vast, unmet and growing demand for improved access to health care services of our members, serving our business-to-consumer (“B2C”) channel, comprised of individual consumers who subscribe directly to our platform, and our business-to-business (“B2B”) channel, comprised of small and midsize business clients as well as other regional and national organizations (collectively, our “clients”), who offer their employees and members access to our platform for free or at discounted rates, respectively.
 
We deploy a multi-pronged go-to-market strategy through a 
direct sales force, focused on large enterprises, and channel partners primarily for small and medium businesses and organizations, which enables us to distribute the Services to the market efficiently. We believe we are building a robust and extensive partnership network in the health insurance industry with distribution agreements with many leading insurance agencies in their respective states, such as BHC Insurance, the third largest independent insurance agency in Arkansas, and Gem State Financial, a leading Idaho-based General Agency. We have been able to increase the reach of our partnership network through an Affinity Marketing Partnership agreement with the National Association of Health Underwriters, a professional association representing more than 100,000 health insurance agents, benefits professionals, consultants, and brokers, from both small and large health insurance companies throughout the United States. The Partnership enables NAHU brokers to market the Health Membership in combination with various insurance products or self-insured plans. This expands NAHU members’ ability to work with organizations to provide additional benefits for employees with customized membership options to enhance existing benefits packages or to open the door to benefits for non-traditional, gig and part-time workers. In addition to these distribution channels, we are also entering into arrangements with businesses, associations and other organizations who offer our Platform to their own end-user customers or members as a benefit, a reward or a component of a loyalty program.
 
We have engineered the Health Karma Platform to be scalable and to grow beyond its current offerings. The flexibility of the Platform enables us to quickly launch new services, expand service offerings or launch in new verticals in a cost- effective manner. In 2021, we launched the following as part of the Health Karma Membership:
 

· | Refined Behavioral health offering to add 24/7/365 behavioral health access to Masters level licensed therapists, providing members instant access to help anytime
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Added a fully Spanish language experience to the Health Karma Membership - online, materials, videos, providers 
· | Dental discount program through Careington 
· | Vision discount program through VSP 
· | Hearing discount program through Epic 
· | Durable medical equipment and services discount program 
· | Vitamin/Nutritional items discount program 

 
We believe the addition of these new programs will help to further enrich our membership model by creating a comprehensive and interconnected offering that delivers a virtuous circle of value for consumers, employers and partners.

We see exciting growth potential as we continue to attract new members through our existing offerings, launch new offerings to address more of the healthcare needs of consumers & employers, and improve Americans’ access to health while reducing what they pay for it. As we extend our platform, we believe that we can create multiple monetization opportunities at different stages of the consumer healthcare journey, enabling us to drive higher expected consumer lifetime value without significant additional consumer acquisition costs.
 
Our Market Opportunity
 
Since inception, we have been focused on changing the way consumers access, interact with and consume healthcare. In the United States, healthcare spending grew to $4.1 trillion in 2020 and is expected to reach $6.2 trillion by 2028, according to the CMS. However, it is not always clear what the individual consumer receives in return for this massive spending. We believe that a new healthcare model, one that places the consumer at the center of the healthcare ecosystem, can help to improve their health care access while reducing what they pay for it.
 
The current healthcare system is broken for most people in the U.S.
 
Despite the vast spending on healthcare in the United States, the current system frequently fails the average consumer. According to the CMS, per capita spend on healthcare in the United States has doubled in the last 20 years with total spending surpassing $4 trillion; however, United States life expectancy and health indicators are falling behind those of other developed nations. Despite this significantly higher healthcare spending, America performed worst among developed nations in some common health metrics including life expectancy, infant mortality, and unmanaged diabetes, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
 
The existing healthcare system is highly fragmented and inefficient, lacks transparency, and is unfriendly to the consumer. In addition, myriad issues related to insurance coverage and other cost barriers stand in the way of too many Americans getting the treatment they need and deserve. The legacy system does not allow patients to receive proper care in a timely manner and ultimately drives poor health outcomes.

Evolving Attitudes among Consumers and Employers towards telehealth
 
Supported by increasing deregulation and broad societal shifts, demand for and provision of telehealth services is surging. Telehealth enables more efficient allocation and utilization of existing clinical resources that could otherwise go unused. With an aging population requiring more complex care and a younger generation that is accustomed to digital technology, telehealth offers an efficient way to leverage finite resources. In the coming years, the telehealth market is positioned for significant growth. The demand for telehealth services is clear among younger generations. According to a survey by Harmony Healthcare IT, three out of four millennials would rather search for medical advice online versus seeing a doctor in-person. These younger generations represent the future of the healthcare system, and telehealth can be at the center of their care experience.
 
Healthcare is a Top Priority for Employers
 
To attract and retain staff, employers are looking to make significant investments in health benefits; yet, as commercial insurance costs have reached record highs, employers and employees remain frustrated. Barriers to accessing timely care during the day and after business hours cause employees to miss work and lose productivity. As a result, many employees self-direct themselves to higher cost settings such as emergency rooms.
 
Rising health care costs are causing many employers to question whether they can afford to offer health benefits to their employees. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s 2021 Employer Health Benefits Survey, it costs up to $21,804 each year for employer-sponsored family health coverage for covered workers in small firms.
 
As costs continue to rise, a common way to offset them is to adjust benefits, such as increasing deductible or copays, lowering coinsurance and increasing out-of-pocket limits. At a certain point, when the benefits become too lean, employees’ perception of their benefits deteriorates.
 
Health Insurance is Tailored to Large Enterprises not Small Businesses
 
In April 2021, about 4 million people in the US quit their jobs, the most since the Bureau of Labor Statistics started publishing the data in 2000. In the "Great Resignation," small businesses face an uphill battle for labor. Some employees are leaving for better pay and benefits, while some are leaving the workforce and relying on government programs.
 
Small business owners are still managing the reality that the number of job openings exceeds the number of unemployed workers, producing a tight labor market. In the January 2022 Jobs Report survey from the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), 47% of independent businesses said they had job openings they struggled to fill, which far exceeds the 48-year historical average of 23%. Moreover, 50% of small business owners reported raising compensation in part to stay competitive as employers and attract applicants to their open position, which is another 48-year record high reading.
 
Small businesses — defined as 500 employees or less by the US Small Business Administration (SBA) — are a key part of economic growth and job creation in the United States. economic rebound — the US Small Business Administration said in 2019 that they accounted for two-thirds of net new jobs. In America, over 30 million firms are small businesses, and they provide employment for nearly half the private workforce. small businesses make up 99.9% of all firms. According to the SBA 2021 Small Business Profile, there are over 32 million small business in the US, making up 99.9% of all US businesses and providing employment for 61.2 million Americans. More jobs are also traditionally created by small businesses and new company formation than by large corporations, with small companies create 1.5 million jobs annually and account for 64% of new jobs, according to the Small Business Administration. But they struggle to raise their prices enough to compensate for the rising costs of benefits and wages.
 
Small businesses, like their larger counterparts, have not been shielded from the increasing cost of health care. Without advantages such as a larger pool of insured employees, more bargaining power with health insurance companies, and the benefit of full-time human resources personnel, small-business owners are often left with little recourse and few options when a health insurance carrier hikes costs. In addition, many small employers have been hanging on during the pandemic and are just starting to rebound. They may not be able to afford full insurance, but they need their employees to stay, as turnover is costly.

The Rise of the Gig Economy (Changing Workforce)
 
With the slow transition away from traditional employment and rise of independent labor over the past decade, the U.S. economy has experienced a significant shift in how employees choose to work. The pandemic has served as a catalyst for deeper change with respect to Americans’ embrace of the gig economy. What seemed like a gradual uptick in interest for freelance and gig work up until 2019 has now exploded onto the mainstream.
 
While around 156 million Americans, about half the U.S. population gets health insurance through an employer, now more than one-third of the workforce now works in the gig economy full- or part-time, according to Upwork’s study of the U.S. independent workforce, “Freelance Forward:2020”. Covid-19 only accelerated Upwork’s data also showed that 12% of workers started freelancing during the pandemic. And there may be no turning back; 60% of people who had taken up freelancing reported that no amount of money would convince them to take a traditional job again.
 
The pandemic also revealed fundamental problems in the traditional employer benefit system. People who lost their jobs and took up independent work were forced to find their own benefits or go without coverage during the pandemic. Today, nearly 70 million Americans, representing more than one-third of the total U.S. workforce earn income as freelancers and that figure is expected to swell to 90 million by 2028, according to Statistica. Despite the trend however, this group of people are underserved compared to W2 full-time employees. The challenge of accessing benefits isn’t just limited to independent workers either. Many employees, particularly part-time employees, do not have access to benefits through their employers. As of January 2022, the Bureau of Labor Statics reported over 25 million part-time workers are in the US. With this changing workforce, the needs of independent and part-time workers will only become more central in the U.S.
 
We believe that favorable macro-economic trends, in combination with the expansion of our capabilities, present significant opportunities for on-demand and consumer driven healthcare to address the most pressing, universal healthcare challenges through solutions, such as ours. At the same time, the emergence of technology platforms solving massive structural challenges in other industries has highlighted the need for similar solutions in healthcare. We believe there is a significant opportunity to solve these challenges through an online solution, such as ours, that matches consumer demand and physician supply in real-time, while offering health plans and employers an attractive, cost-effective healthcare alternative for their beneficiaries. We believe that Health Karma offers a solution to address these challenges.
 
Health Karma Platform
 
At Health Karma, we empower consumers—both individual consumers and small and midsize business (“SMB”)—to make smarter healthcare decisions with confidence via our digital platform. Technology has changed the way consumers manage their healthcare, making them more comfortable with comparing and accessing healthcare services online. This change has accelerated with the dramatic growth in companies offering innovative healthcare products and services. At Health Karma, we are leveraging this transformation to improve peoples’ access to health care while reducing what they pay for it—ultimately helping to improve the well-being of consumers and the healthcare industry as a whole. As the healthcare industry becomes more fragmented and complex, our value proposition as a trusted, independent platform for consumers increases.
 
Powered by our own differentiated full stack technology platform, we have built a suite of services that enable us to earn our members’ trust, leverage the power of personalized data, and help our members access quality care they can afford.
 
The Health Karma Platform was purpose-built to seamlessly connect our existing and future health and wellness programs into one Platform to help drive real member and customer outcomes. We have built our Platform from the ground up to solve the unique challenges of individual consumers as well as organizations and their members.
 
Our Platform helps solve many of the common pain points for both Consumers and Employers when launching, administering, and maintaining health and wellness-related programs. By integrating many leading programs into one Platform, Users get the same, consistent user experience, without fumbling for passwords across multiple programs or struggling to remember where to access each benefit. Built as a modular solution Health Karma can scale up depending on the unique needs of each member or employer customer by adding programs over time.
 
As we continue to bring the Health Karma experience to new members, new employers, and new markets, our goal will remain the same: to build engagement, earn trust, and help our members stay healthy and well.

Complete Solution to Manage the Consumer Healthcare Journey
 
Health Karma offers a simple and intuitive consumer experience that enables our users to take control of their health care decisions.
 
That experience begins with trust and engagement, which we earn by providing our users with features that help them navigate the many disconnected elements of the healthcare ecosystem. When our users adopt these tools, we not only streamline their day-to-day interactions with the healthcare system and improve user satisfaction, we also obtain valuable data that lets us better understand their unique health care needs. Trust, engagement, and personalized data allow us to help guide our users to the providers that can give them the right care, including virtual care, at the right time and right cost. Our technology stack will also permit us to offer personalized insights and benefits. Our ability to deliver a high-value product, in turn, creates more trust, engagement, and in time, enhances our ability to provide personalized, data-driven insights.
 

An important aspect of our approach to building trust and engaging members is to engage with them through whatever channel is most comfortable for them. Whether it is a secure in-app message to answer coverage and benefit questions, a consultation with a licensed medical provider in the middle of the night through our telehealth offering, talking with a licensed, professional therapist in as little as 24 hours to address common behavioral health concerns, or finding the right in-network provider and scheduling an in-person appointment, we are there for our users when they need us most. In this way, we are building a product experience more similar to what consumers experience from a best-in-class technology or consumer products company than from a traditional health care organization.

Our Go-to-Market Strategy for Health Karma
 
With Health Karma now fully developed and launched into the market, we are leading a full-on roll-out of the Health Karma Platform by shifting the focus to member growth through a multi-pronged go-to-market strategy:

· | Health Karma Partner Program (B2B2C) - In late First Quarter of 2021, we introduced the Health Karma Partner Program which was is designed to provide additional multi-tiered sales channels to deliver our product offerings to employers and individuals, and in turn accelerate market awareness and adoption. The program provides Employer Groups, Insurance Agencies, Associations, Community Groups, Municipalities, and other organizations and sole proprietorships the opportunity to offer Health Karma to their clients while simultaneously building an additional residual revenue stream. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Health Karma Employer Program (B2B) – In mid-First Quarter of this 2021, we launched the Health Karma Employer Program in which contractual agreements with employers require them to offer Health Karma and associated products and services as part of their benefits packages. By focusing on the vastly underserved small employer market, Health Karma for Employers allows us to rapidly accelerate user acquisition and adoption of Health Karm to create a robust and engaged user base. Due to the accelerated roll out of the Health Karma for Employers program since the launch in mid-First Quarter of this year, we have expanded our in-house employer sales team and our client success team to actively manage these new accounts.
· | Health Karma Direct to Consumer Program (B2C) - As brand awareness has increased, we have been successful in our performance marketing initiatives to drive customer acquisition. Increased customer sign-ups have come from targeted social media campaigns, content marketing through its educational blog as well as customized task-based in-app messaging and email communications. The company has leveraged SEO & SEM to enhance Health Karma's search presence. Word of mouth is also taking hold as customers are being referred in from users that are recommending Health Karma as a solution to lower healthcare costs. 

 
We primarily generate revenue from employer customers and consumer subscription fees, which are typically annual in nature, providing significant revenue visibility. Through our per-Member-per-month (“PMPM”) subscription model, we enter into contracts with our employer customers that pay a fixed monthly rate based on the total number of Members. In most cases, Members and their Dependents have unlimited access to our Platform and do not pay extra fees for increased utilization, unless they wish to access Services outside the scope of those covered by the subscription.
 
Our Growth Opportunities
 
Continue expanding B2C user base and increase engagement. Through our expanding network and customer adoption strategy, we will continue to focus on growing consumer member adoption. We expect this strategy to be further complemented by sustained investment in our platform capabilities, as well as through continuing to leverage our growing brand awareness. We believe our growth opportunity in both health and wellness to be substantial. In addition, as a result of the end-to-end nature of our platform, we believe we are well-positioned to create care continuity for our members across a broader range of health and wellness verticals. We plan to drive further engagement of our existing member base by expanding our offerings beyond our current programs to include capabilities such as an enhanced behavioral offering, wearable integration, Wellness challenges and rewards, and medical records transfer in order to drive higher member lifetime engagement and value. We use a strategic and disciplined approach to building our marketing budget, and are able to achieve efficient spend levels on a per-customer basis by leveraging our brand and strong relationships with outbound and inbound marketing channels.

Expand clients and B2B offering. We expect to meaningfully expand our B2B channel through both the addition of new employer and group clients, as well as a focus on driving deeper penetration rates within our existing clients. We plan to add new B2B clients by contracting with additional regional and national agencies, accelerating our outbound marketing efforts, leveraging our broker and consultant relationships and continuing to penetrate the massively underserved part-time and independent worker market. Additionally, we are focused on further developing our dedicated internal B2B sales team solely focused on expanding our B2B client base as well as driving penetration within existing contracts–an effort we expect to drive significant traction within the near-term. Within our existing employer base, we plan drive penetration and engagement with an invested focus on client success. Additionally, because of our embedded position serving the B2B customer base, we believe we are well-positioned to innovate and lay the groundwork for additional services that drive value for their members such as navigation across the ever-changing health and wellness landscape.
 
Opportunistic M&A and Product Development. We are well-positioned to further expand our solution set through opportunistic acquisitions or product development responsive to the evolving and expanding needs of our client base. Our technology platform is built to easily integrate with non-native technologies and to offer a single cohesive platform. We plan to use a disciplined approach to strategically acquire complementary capabilities and service lines. These may include, but are not limited to, healthcare FinTech platforms, Third-party data providers, wellness and coaching platforms, workers comp solutions, and other virtual care coordination platforms.
 
Technology
 
Health Karma’s underlying technology is a highly scalable, integrated, application program interface or API-driven technology platform. The platform has been built to accommodate the seamless and quick introduction of new services, technologies and functionality that we have introduced through strategic partnerships.
 
Our platform is built on a modern cloud-based technology stack, employing Agile development cycles and a DevOps approach to infrastructure. Unlike with traditional healthcare IT, our technology platform is updated frequently, without long upgrade cycles. Our modular, service-oriented architecture utilizes API standards for ease of implementing new functionalities and integrating with external systems. By designing our product as a platform, we have created an overarching infrastructure where consumer data, preferences, and third-party partners can all interact through Health Karma’s API. Data is the heart of our technology so because of this we have the potential integrate machine learning and natural language processing to automate recommendations and workflows, uncovering insights that we can incorporate back into the design platform.
 
This enables our platform to act as a sales channel for other companies. We don’t need to create internally the best tools and technology because we can deliver other’s state of the art technology and applications through our platform. Similar to other two-sided marketplaces, the platform can bring innovative new products to consumers and employers, while at the same time opening up distribution and revenue opportunities for other health companies. Furthermore, we believe that this will generate a virtuous cycle, leveraging our growing customer base to attract the best healthcare partners (and vice versa)--increasing value for all stakeholders.
 
Our proprietary technology platform powers all aspects of our company: engaging members, supporting partners, and advancing business objectives. Our technology is grounded in human-centered design thinking and leverages insights from behavioral interaction. Our product designers and engineers collaborate closely with our operational team members, as well as healthcare advisors and partners in the Health Karma Network to observe and then optimize workflows. We employ user testing and experiment-driven design (such as A/B testing) to enhance our member and partner experiences.

Health Karma focuses on member growth through two primary avenues: directly acquiring consumer members, and signing agreements with employers that will offer Health Karma and associated products and services as part of their benefits packages. We use marketing and sales strategies to reach consumers as well as employee benefits leaders. Employer marketing and sales strategies also include account-based marketing, business development initiatives, and client service teams focused on customer acquisition, employee enrollment, and member engagement. We derive employer sales through a direct sales force, focused on large enterprises, and channel partners primarily for 
small and medium businesses and organizations, which enables us to distribute the Services to the market efficiently.

Consumer Sales & Marketing 
 
When we market and sell directly to individuals, we initially plan to focus on increasing brand awareness, followed by performance marketing targeted toward user acquisition, activation and engagement.
 
Our marketing strategy in new markets is primarily centered on increasing overall brand awareness, familiarity, consideration and ultimately enrollment. We have carefully developed a robust marketing plan to achieve these objectives.
 
SEO, Social & Traditional - We will drive brand awareness and conversions to our platform using social media marketing via Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and others. In addition, we plan to leverage SEO & SEM to enhance Health Karma’s search presence both organically and paid.
Content Marketing - We consistently release marketing content through our blog that aims to educate our audience about the value that our product provides. We also develop thought leadership content such as whitepapers, eBooks, and infographics and use public relations to secure earned media placements. Our content marketing efforts aim to influence and persuade readers without having to rely solely on conventional direct selling tactics.
Influencer Marketing - We will launch an initiative to guest blog articles and features in healthcare, personal finance, and startup tech publications like TechCrunch, Wired, VentureBeat, and other outlets in our industry. Additionally, we participate in industry conferences, and may partner with media outlets, event venues, local businesses, and social media influencers to increase brand awareness.
 
As brand awareness increases in more established markets, we shift our efforts to performance marketing focused on both customer acquisition and engagement. Our performance marketing initiatives include customized task-based in-app messages and email communications to drive engagement among members, in addition to more targeted advertisements through direct mail, Google Search, YouTube and social media for member acquisition.
 
Employer Sales & Marketing 
 
With the roll out of Health Karma to employers, we are developing and expanding our in-house employer sales force to be comprised of sales professionals who will be organized by geography, customer size, and industry. We support our sales force in several ways, including through account-based marketing resources and the deployment of a business development team to educate employer decision makers on the benefits of offering Health Karma to their employees. We also leverage sales analytics to further support lead generation. Additionally, our client success team actively manages our customer accounts and provides in-depth support.
 
Through the Health Karma Partner Program, we also work with channel partners such as payroll and professional employer organizations to reach small and medium businesses and organizations. Additionally, we partner with select regional and national benefits brokers and consultants to educate and sell potential customers on our offerings.
 
Customer and Partner Services and Support
 
We believe that many partners and employer customers are not technical experts and that they bear an enormous responsibility to successfully run their businesses day in and day out. Therefore, we aim to provide end-to-end customer support, including full profile data conversion and import, live onboarding and technical support via telephone, email, and screen sharing; in-software self-service tools; advanced professional services; and educational events. In addition, we also have a dedicated support team that is focused on seeking to ensure that Health Karma members are having the best possible experience.
Customer & Partner Onboarding. We typically onboard new customers and partners with live training sessions delivered via telephone and web conference. These trainings are supplemented by self- service setup checklists, online help materials and webinars.
Customer & Partner Success. To identify opportunities for greater adoption of our products and services and to further help our customers be more successful on our platform, we engage with them to better understand their business goals and objectives; provide targeted education about relevant features, products and services as well as business best practices; and develop a recommended success plan with periodic outreach to check in on their progress.

All customer service and support is provided by our in-house personnel who are invested in Health Karma’s core values and closely connected to our Product, Technology and Experience team.
Regulatory Environment
 
Participants in the health care industry are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations in the United States at the federal and state levels as well as applicable international laws. Although many regulatory and governmental requirements do not directly apply to our business, our customers are required to comply with a variety of laws, and we may be affected by these laws as a result of our contractual obligations. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the Unites States, both at the federal and state level, which could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business. We have attempted to structure our operations to comply with applicable legal requirements, but there can be no assurance that our operations will not be challenged or impacted by enforcement initiatives.
Healthcare Reform
 
Our business could be affected by changes in health care laws, including without limitation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), which was enacted in March 2010. The ACA has changed how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of individuals, changes in Medicare program spending and insurance market reforms. Ongoing government and legislative initiatives may bring about other changes.
 
While most of the provisions of the ACA and other health care reform legislation will not be directly applicable to us, they may affect the business of many of our customers, which may in turn affect our business. Although we are unable to predict with any reasonable certainty or otherwise quantify the likely impact of the ACA, any amendment or repeal of the ACA, or other health care reform on our business model, financial condition, or results of operations, negative changes in the business of our customers and the number of individuals they insure may negatively impact our business.
 
Requirements Regarding the Privacy and Security of Personal Information
 
U.S.- HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements. There are many U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal health information. Additionally , regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”), establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Any health plan customers, as well as health care clearinghouses and certain providers with which we may have or may establish business relationships, are covered entities that are regulated under HIPAA. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which became effective on February 17, 2010, significantly expanded HIPAA’s privacy and security requirements. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” who are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. Under HIPAA and our contractual agreements with our customers, we are considered a “business associate” to our customers and thus are directly subject to HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. In order to provide our covered entity customers with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, HIPAA requires our customers to enter into business associate agreements with it. Such agreements must, among other things, require us to:

· | limit how we will use and disclose the protected health information; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | implement reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information from misuse;
· | enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information; 
· | report security incidents, breaches and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information; and 
· | assist the customer in question with certain duties under the privacy standards. 

 
In addition to HIPAA regulations, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair or deceptive practices and laws that place specific requirements on use of data. Such state laws can be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA, in which case we must comply with the more stringent law. As a result, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations in order to ensure we are in compliance with the stricter state laws.

Data Protection and Breaches. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of individuals’ personal information. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA, we must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to our contractual partners within 60 days of discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain circumstances involving large breaches, to the media. Under the GDPR, the data controller is required to report personal data breaches to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of discovery of the breach.
 
We have implemented and maintained physical, technical and administrative safeguards intended to protect all personal data, and have processes in place to assist it in complying with all applicable laws, regulations and contractual requirements regarding the protection of these data and properly responding to any security breaches or incidents. However, we cannot be sure that these safeguards are adequate to protect all personal data or to assist us in complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the privacy and security of personal data and responding to any security breaches or incidents. Furthermore, in many cases, applicable state laws, including breach notification requirements, are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy and security standards and are subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thereby complicating our compliance efforts. Additionally, state and federal laws regarding deceptive practices may apply to public assurances we give to individuals about the security of services we provide on behalf of our contractual customers.
 
Other Healthcare Regulations
 
In addition to data privacy laws, our operations and arrangements with healthcare professionals, clients, and third-party payors may subject us to various federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including without limitation fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; civil and criminal false claims laws; physician transparency laws; and state laws regarding the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting prohibitions. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales and marketing operations, and our interactions with healthcare professionals. We continually monitor legislative, regulatory and judicial developments related to licensure and engagement arrangements with professionals; however, new agency interpretations, federal or state legislation or regulations, or judicial decisions could require us to change how we operate, may increase our costs of services and could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Other Requirements. In addition to HIPAA, numerous other U.S. state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information and health care provider information. Some states also are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy and security of medical records or other types of medical information. In many cases, these state laws are not preempted by the HIPAA privacy standards and may be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. Further, Congress and a number of states have considered or are considering prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of medical or other information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.
