ITEM 1. BUSINESS



In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Gesher I Acquisition Corp.



Overview



We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands on February 23, 2021. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location, although we intend to focus our search for target businesses in the cannabis industry.



In February 2021, we issued an aggregate of 2,875,000 ordinary shares (the “founders’ shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.009 per share, to Gesher I Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”). Sponsor subsequently transferred 50,000 founders’ shares.



In February 2021, we also issued to designees of EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters in our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering” or “IPO”), an aggregate of 200,000 ordinary shares (the “representative shares”) at a price of $0.0001 per share.



On October 14, 2021, we consummated the IPO of 10,000,000 units. Each unit (“Unit”) consists of one ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $100,000,000.



Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 4,550,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $4,550,000. The Private Warrants were sold to the Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital and its designees. The Private Warrants are identical to the Warrants included in the Units sold in the IPO.



In connection with the IPO, we entered into contingent forward purchase agreements (the “Contingent Forward Purchase Agreements”) with certain forward purchase investors (the “Forward Purchase Investors”). The Contingent Forward Purchase Agreements provided for the purchase of an aggregate of up to 4,500,000 forward purchase units (the “Forward Purchase Units”), at a price of $10.00 per Forward Purchase Unit, in a private placement to close immediately prior to, or simultaneously with, the closing of our initial business combination. The Contingent Forward Purchase Agreements provide that the Forward Purchase Investors are entitled to registration rights with respect to the Forward Purchase Units (and underlying securities) purchased by them. Otherwise, the Forward Purchase Units held by our Forward Purchase Investors will be identical to the Units sold in the IPO. The Forward Purchase Investors either received a membership interest in Sponsor in consideration of the foregoing, entitling them to each receive 100,000 founders’ shares, or will receive 100,000 founders’ shares from the Sponsor upon consummation of our initial business combination. Each Forward Purchase Investor will have the right to be excused from its purchase obligation in connection with any specific business combination if, within five days following written notice delivered by us of our intention to enter into a specific business combination, the Forward Purchase Investor notifies us that it has decided not to proceed with the purchase for any reason. If any Forward Purchase Investor exercises such right, or otherwise fails to purchase the Forward Purchase Units allocated to it, such Forward Purchase Investor will forfeit a portion of its interest in Sponsor. Any funds from the sale of the Forward Purchase Units may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination, for expenses in connection with the initial business combination or for the combined company’s working capital needs. This obligation is independent of the percentage of shareholders electing to have their public shares converted and could provide us with a minimum funding level for the initial business combination. The Contingent Forward Purchase Agreements also provide a right of first refusal for our Forward Purchase Investors to participate in any sale of equity securities by us in connection with our initial business combination so long as such forward purchase investor elects to purchase its forward purchase units.

On October 21, 2021, we consummated the sale of an additional 1,500,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit pursuant to the underwriters’ over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of $15,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of additional Units, we consummated the sale of an additional 450,000 Private Warrants at $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $450,000. Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private Warrants, an aggregate amount of $116,150,000 was placed in the trust account established in connection with the IPO (the “Trust Account”).



On March 23, 2022, the Company and one of the Forward Purchase Investors (the “Lead Forward Purchaser”), M&G (ACS) Japan Equity Fund, as managed by M&G Investment Management Limited, entered into an amended and restated forward purchase agreement (the “Amended Forward Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Amended Forward Purchase Agreement, the Company will issue and sell to the Lead Forward Purchaser, and the Lead Forward Purchaser will purchase from the Company, an aggregate of 4,000,000 Forward Purchase Units, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Forward Purchase Unit, or $40,000,000 in the aggregate (the “Forward Purchase Subscription”), in a private placement to close immediately prior to, or simultaneously with, the closing of an initial business combination.



Additionally, the Lead Forward Purchaser has agreed to provide up to $10,000,000 of committed capital (the “Backstop Commitment”) to the Company in the event that, as of immediately prior to the closing of a business combination agreement, certain minimum cash conditions are not met after taking into account conversions by Company shareholders in connection with the business combination. In exchange for providing the Backstop Commitment, the Lead Forward Purchaser will receive (a) an additional amount of ordinary shares in the Company equal to the amount of the Backstop Commitment drawn, divided by $10.00 (rounded up to the nearest whole number), and (b) 500,000 warrants of the Company (collectively, the “Backstop Subscription,” and the shares and warrants issued in the Backstop Subscription, the “Backstop Securities”).



In connection with the business combination, the Lead Forward Purchaser has unconditionally agreed not to exercise its conversion rights with respect to any of the ordinary shares included in the Forward Purchase Units or the Backstop Securities or any of the ordinary shares the Lead Forward Purchaser subscribed for in the IPO.



The Lead Forward Purchaser’s obligation to subscribe for the Forward Purchase Units and to provide the Backstop Commitment pursuant to the Amended Forward Purchase Agreement is binding with respect to certain possible acquisition targets.



Pursuant to the Amended Forward Purchase Agreement, the Lead Forward Purchaser will be entitled to registration rights with respect to the ordinary shares and warrants of the Company included in the Forward Purchase Units and the Backstop Securities. The closing of the Forward Purchase Subscription and the Backstop Subscription shall be on the same date and immediately prior to, or simultaneously with, the closing of a business combination. The Amended Forward Purchase Agreement does not grant the Lead Forward Purchaser any special corporate governance rights, and the Lead Forward Purchaser is not an affiliate of the Company or Sponsor.



The terms and conditions of the Amended Forward Purchase Agreement are otherwise materially the same as the terms and conditions set forth in the Contingent Forward Purchase Agreements.



For additional information regarding the Forward Purchase Subscription, Backstop Commitment and Backstop Subscription, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 23, 2022, and exhibits thereto.



On April 14, 2022, we entered into a further backstop subscription with Composite Analysis Group, Inc. (“Composite”), an affiliate of Safer Logistics LLC, pursuant to which Composite has agreed to provide $10,000,000 of committed capital (the “Composite Backstop Commitment”) to the Company in the event that, as of immediately prior to the closing of an initial business combination, certain minimum cash conditions are not met after taking into account conversions by Company shareholders in connection with the business combination and certain other investments. In exchange for providing the Composite Backstop Commitment, the Company will issue and sell to Composite (a) 1,000,000 ordinary shares of the Company at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, and (b) 100,000 warrants of the Company (collectively, the “Composite Backstop Subscription,” and the shares and warrants issued in the Composite Backstop Subscription, the “Composite Backstop Securities”).

Pursuant to the Composite Backstop Subscription, Composite will be entitled to registration rights with respect to the ordinary shares and warrants of the Company included in the Composite Backstop Securities. The closing of the Composite Backstop Subscription shall be on the same date and immediately prior to, or simultaneously with, the closing of an initial business combination. The Composite Backstop Subscription does not grant to Composite any special corporate governance rights, and Composite is not an affiliate of the Company or Sponsor.



For additional information regarding the Composite Backstop Commitment and Composite Backstop Subscription, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2022, and exhibits thereto.



The Business Combination



On May 31, 2022, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with Freightos Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company limited by shares (“Freightos”), Freightos Merger Sub I, a Cayman Islands exempted company limited by shares and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Freightos (“Merger Sub I”), and Freightos Merger Sub II, a Cayman Islands exempted company limited by shares and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Freightos (“Merger Sub II”), pursuant to which, among other transactions, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, (i) Merger Sub I will merge with and into the Company (the “First Merger”), with the Company surviving the First Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Freightos, and (ii) the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub II (the “Second Merger” and together with the First Merger, collectively, the “Mergers”), with Merger Sub II surviving the Second Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Freightos.



Freightos operates a leading, vendor-neutral booking and payment platform for international freight. Through its marketplace for air, ocean and land freight transportation, Freightos connects carriers, freight forwarders and importers/exporters to provide instant pricing, booking, payment and shipment management services.



Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, at the closing (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated thereunder (collectively, the “Transaction”), among other things, (i) each ordinary share of the Company (“Gesher Ordinary Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger (and after giving effect to the Unit Separation (as defined below) and any conversions), will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be converted into the right of the holder thereof to receive one ordinary share of Freightos, par value $0.00001 per share (“Freightos Ordinary Shares”), and (ii) each issued and outstanding warrant of the Company (“Gesher Warrants”) will be assumed by Freightos and converted into a corresponding warrant exercisable for Freightos Ordinary Shares subject to substantially the same terms and conditions applicable to the Gesher Warrants (“Freightos Warrants”).



Immediately prior to the First Merger, the Gesher Ordinary Shares and the Gesher Warrants comprising each issued and outstanding unit of Gesher (“Gesher Unit”), consisting of one Gesher Ordinary Share and one-half of one Gesher Warrant, will be automatically detached (the “Unit Separation”) and the holder thereof will be deemed to hold one Gesher Ordinary Share and one-half of one Gesher Warrant. No fractional Gesher Warrants will be issued in connection with the Unit Separation such that if a holder of such Gesher Units would be entitled to receive a fractional Gesher Warrant upon such separation, the number of Gesher Warrants to be issued to such holder upon such separation will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of Gesher Warrants.





3







Immediately prior to the First Merger, Freightos and its shareholders will engage in a recapitalization of its outstanding equity securities (the “Recapitalization”) so that the only outstanding equity securities of Freightos will be Freightos Ordinary Shares and certain options to acquire Freightos Ordinary Shares that will remain outstanding following the Transaction. To effect the Recapitalization, (1) each preferred share of Freightos will automatically convert into Freightos Ordinary Shares in accordance with the Freightos organizational documents, and (2) immediately following such conversion, the Freightos Ordinary Shares will automatically convert into such number of Freightos Ordinary Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing 39,000,000 by the sum of (A) the number of Freightos Ordinary Shares then issued and outstanding (including as a result of the aforementioned conversion of each preferred share of Freightos) and (B) without duplication, the number of Freightos Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of all options to acquire Freightos Ordinary Shares that either have vested prior to such time or are to vest pursuant to their terms on or prior to September 30, 2022. Following the Recapitalization, the Freightos Ordinary Shares shall be valued at $10.00 per share such that the total value of all Freightos Ordinary Shares equals $390,000,000, taking into account the options to acquire Freightos Ordinary Shares that either have vested prior to Closing or are to vest pursuant to their terms on or prior to September 30, 2022.



The Business Combination Agreement does not provide for any purchase price adjustments.



For additional information regarding the Business Combination Agreement, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 6, 2022, and exhibits thereto.



Business Combination Transaction Financing



Gesher has obtained commitments (i) for up to $70,000,000 of equity financing in connection with the Transaction pursuant to the Amended Forward Purchase Agreement, Backstop Commitment, Composite Backstop Commitment, and PIPE Financing (as defined below), collectively, and (ii) from the Forward Purchaser, that the Forward Purchaser will not exercise its conversion rights in connection with the Transaction with respect to its 990,000 outstanding Gesher Ordinary Shares that the Forward Purchaser acquired in the IPO, with a conversion value of approximately $10,000,000. Prior to the consummation of the Mergers, Freightos and the Company will enter into an assignment and assumption agreement, which will provide for the assignment and assumption by Freightos of the Company’s rights and obligations under the forward purchase and backstop agreements described above.



PIPE Financing



Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company, Freightos and Alshaffafia Trading W.L.L (the “PIPE Investor”), an affiliate of Qatar Airways Group Q.C.S.C. (“Qatar Airways”), entered into a PIPE Subscription Agreement (the “PIPE Agreement”) pursuant to which the PIPE Investor committed to purchase 1,000,000 Freightos Ordinary Shares at $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $10,000,000 (the “PIPE Financing”) immediately prior to the Closing. Each of the PIPE Investor and Qatar Airways are shareholders of Freightos. Under the PIPE Agreement the obligations of the parties to consummate the PIPE Financing are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions of the respective parties, including, among others, (i) all conditions precedent under the Business Combination Agreement having been satisfied or waived, (ii) the accuracy of representations and warranties of Freightos and the Company in the Business Combination Agreement, (iii) Freightos material compliance with covenants and agreements in the PIPE Agreement, (iv) the absence of a legal prohibition on consummating the PIPE Financing, and (v) the approval for listing of Freightos Ordinary Shares on Nasdaq.



For additional information regarding the PIPE Financing, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 6, 2022, and exhibits thereto.



Forward Purchaser Commitment



The Forward Purchaser has unconditionally agreed not to exercise its conversion rights in connection with the Transaction with respect to its 990,000 outstanding Gesher Ordinary Shares that the Forward Purchaser acquired in Gesher’s initial public offering. Pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement, the Forward Purchaser will be entitled to registration rights for the Freightos securities it receives at Closing. Consummation of the forward purchase and the backstop subscription will be on the same date and immediately prior to, or simultaneously with, the Closing.

Business Combination Agreement Related Agreements



Support Agreements



Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company and Freightos entered into Support Agreements (collectively, the “Support Agreements”) with certain shareholders of Freightos (the “Freightos Supporting Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Support Agreements, each Freightos Supporting Shareholder agreed to vote all of such shareholder’s Freightos shares in favor of the Business Combination Agreement and any actions that Freightos proposes in connection with the Transaction and to vote its Freightos shares against any other business combination transaction, any material change in the capitalization or corporate structure of Freightos, or any other action or proposal that would reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or adversely affect the Transaction. The Support Agreements prevent transfers of the Freightos shares held by the Freightos Supporting Shareholders between the date of the Support Agreement and the Closing, except for certain permitted transfers where the recipients also agree to comply with the Support Agreement.
Freightos Registration Rights Agreement



The Business Combination Agreement contemplates that on or prior to the Closing, Freightos will enter into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Freightos Registration Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which Freightos will grant certain registration rights to certain Freightos shareholders with respect to the Freightos Ordinary Shares and Freightos Warrants. The Freightos Registration Rights Agreement provides, among other things, certain Freightos shareholders with certain demand rights in the event of an underwritten offering, as well as piggyback rights in the event Freightos or any other holder of Freightos equity securities conducts a registered offering.



For additional information regarding the Freightos Registration Rights Agreement, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 6, 2022, and exhibits thereto.



First Amendment to the SPAC Registration Rights Agreement



The Business Combination Agreement contemplates that on or prior to the Closing, the Company’s Registration Rights Agreement dated as of October 12, 2021 (the “SPAC Registration Rights Agreement”) will be amended (the “Amendment to SPAC Registration Rights Agreement”) to provide that Freightos will assume the obligations of Gesher under the SPAC Registration Rights Agreement, and, among other things, to reflect the issuance of Freightos Ordinary Shares and Freightos Warrants.



For additional information regarding the Amendment to SPAC Registration Rights Agreement, see the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 6, 2022, and exhibits thereto.



Lock-Up Agreements



Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of the Business Combination Agreement, certain members of the Sponsor (the “Sponsor Holders”) entered into a Lock-Up Agreement with Freightos, the Company and Sponsor (collectively, the “Sponsor Lock-Up Agreements”). Pursuant to the Sponsor Lock-Up Agreements, each Sponsor Holder agreed not to sell, hypothecate, pledge, hedge, grant any option to purchase or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, establish or increase certain derivative provisions with respect to the Restricted Securities (as defined below), or transfer economic ownership of the Restricted Securities, or make a public announcement of the intention to effect any such transaction (collectively, “Transfer”) any Freightos Ordinary Shares, Freightos Warrants, or any Freightos Ordinary Shares issuable in respect of Freightos Warrants (collectively, the “Restricted Securities”) received by Sponsor and attributable to such Sponsor Holder, from and after the Closing until the 36 month anniversary (such period, the “Sponsor Lock-Up Period”) of the date on which Closing occurs (the “Sponsor Lock-Up Restrictions”). However, (i) at each nine month anniversary of the Closing date, 25% of the Restricted Securities attributable to each Sponsor Holder will cease to be deemed Restricted Securities and (ii) if prior to the end of the Sponsor Lock-Up Period, a Change of Control (as defined in the Sponsor Lock-Up Agreements) of Freightos occurs, then all of the then-Restricted Securities will cease to be deemed Restricted Securities. When Restricted Securities cease to be Restricted Securities, such released securities may be Transferred without regard to the Sponsor Lock-Up Restrictions.

Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of the Business Combination Agreement, certain shareholders of Freightos (the “Freightos Holders”) entered into a Lock-Up Agreement with Freightos and Gesher (collectively, the “Freightos Lock-Up Agreements”). The Freightos Lock-Up Agreements are substantially similar to the Sponsor Lock-Up Agreements, except that (i) Restricted Securities includes only Freightos Ordinary Shares and Freightos Ordinary Shares underlying options to acquire Freightos Ordinary Shares, and (ii) the Freightos Holders are prohibited from Transferring the Restricted Securities from and after the Closing until the 24 month anniversary (the “Freightos Lock-Up Period”) of the date on which Closing occurs; provided, however, that (a) at each six month anniversary of the date on which Closing occurs, 25% of the Restricted Securities attributable to each Freightos Holder will cease to be deemed Restricted Securities and (b) if at any time after the Closing but prior to the end of the Freightos Lock-Up Period, a Change of Control occurs, then all of the then-Restricted Securities will cease to be deemed Restricted Securities. The Freightos Lock-Up Agreement with Asian Gateway Investments Pte. Ltd. permits Asian Gateway Investments Pte. Ltd. to make certain transfers that are not conducted on the Nasdaq, subject to certain conditions.



Other than as specifically discussed, this Annual Report assumes that we will not consummate the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and will seek to consummate a business combination with another target business.



Effecting our Initial Business Combination



General



We intend to consummate our initial business combination using cash held in the Trust Account, the proceeds from one or more private financings, and our equity as the consideration.



If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for conversions of our ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other assets and companies or for working capital.



We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination (which may include a specified future issuance), and we may complete our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. In addition, we intend to target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our IPO and the Private Placement, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the Trust Account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any conversions by public shareholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek shareholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, including pursuant to any specified future issuance, or through loans in connection with our initial business combination.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.





6







Sources of Target Businesses



We expect that our principal means of identifying potential target businesses will be through the extensive contacts and relationships of our Sponsor, initial shareholders, officers and directors. While our officers and directors are not required to commit any specific amount of time in identifying or performing due diligence on potential target businesses, our officers and directors believe that the relationships they have developed over their careers will generate a number of potential business combination opportunities that will warrant further investigation. We also anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read our IPO prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting.



Our officers and directors must present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination, subject to any fiduciary or contractual obligations. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will our Sponsor, initial shareholders, officers, directors or their respective affiliates be paid any compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than the $10,000 per month administrative fee payable to an affiliate of Company officer and director Omri Cherni as described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the payment of consulting, success or finder fees in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, the repayment of working capital loans and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses. Our audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our Sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval.



We have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or Sponsor. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (i) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and (ii) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to our management team’s fiduciary obligations and the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the Trust Account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:




● | financial condition and results of operation;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | growth potential;
--+------------------


● | brand recognition and potential;
--+---------------------------------


● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


● | competitive position;
--+----------------------






7








● | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


● | stage of development of the products, processes or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | existing distribution and potential for expansion;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impact of regulation on the business;
--+--------------------------------------


● | regulatory environment of the industry;
--+----------------------------------------


● | costs associated with effecting the business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.



The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.

Fair Market Value of Target Business



Nasdaq listing rules require that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable and deferred underwriting commissions) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.



We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or a newly formed subsidiary or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding shares or capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of Trust Account balance test.



The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public shareholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.



Lack of Business Diversification



We may seek to effect a business combination with more than one target business, although we expect to complete our business combination with just one business. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management



Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full-time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination



In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our shareholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each shareholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. Whether we seek shareholder approval or engage in a tender offer, we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek shareholder approval, an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law is passed, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company. We have no specified maximum percentage threshold for conversions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and even those public shareholders who vote in favor of our initial business combination have the right to convert their public shares. As a result, this may make it easier for us to consummate our initial business combination.





10







Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the Trust Account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets either immediately prior to or upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait until April 14, 2023, the date that is 18 months from the closing of our IPO (or later if such date is extended in accordance with our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association), in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the Trust Account.



Our Sponsor, initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.



None of our officers, directors, Sponsor, initial shareholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or ordinary shares in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination or that they wish to convert their shares, our officers, directors, Sponsor, initial shareholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote and reduce the number of conversions, as further descriebd below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, Sponsor, initial shareholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.



Permitted Purchases of Our Securities



If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct conversions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately-negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares or warrants our Sponsor, initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of our initial business combination.





11







The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our ordinary shares or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.



It is anticipated that our Sponsor, initial shareholders, officers, directors and/or any of their affiliates would identify the shareholders with whom they may pursue privately-negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of conversion requests tendered by shareholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder would receive if it elected to convert its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.



Conversion Rights and Manner of Conducting Conversions



At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their ordinary shares to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our Company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq’s shareholder approval rules.



The requirement that we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares by one of the two methods listed above is contained in provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq. Such provisions may be amended if approved by the holders of two-thirds of our ordinary shares casting a vote upon such matter in a general meeting of the Company.



If we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with a shareholder meeting, we will:




● | conduct the conversions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------






12







If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will:




● | conduct the conversions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the conversion rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Our Sponsor, initial shareholders and our officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to or in our IPO or purchased by them in the aftermarket. Additionally, the holders of the representative shares will not have conversion rights with respect to the representative shares.



The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly convert their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the representative of the underwriters.



We may require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.



However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.



Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to shareholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time the shareholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his, her or its shares if he, she or it wishes to seek to exercise his, her or its conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the shareholder, whether or not he, she or it is a record holder or his, her or its shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his, her or its broker and requesting delivery of his, her or its shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “In connection with any shareholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require shareholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.



Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of public shares delivered his, her or its certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he, she or it may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.

Liquidation if No Business Combination



Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we will have only until April 14, 2023, the date that is 18 months from the closing of the IPO (unless such period is extended as provided in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association), to complete an initial business combination. If we have not completed an initial business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, convert 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable (and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay liquidation expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which conversion will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such conversion, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.



Our Sponsor, initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect our public shareholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to convert 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of the IPO unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their ordinary shares upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This conversion right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, initial shareholders, executive officers, directors or any other person.



We are required to seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities engaged by us before or after the IPO) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the Trust Account to our public shareholders. Nevertheless, Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the underwriters of the IPO, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that other vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the Trust Account. Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below $10.10 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, and we believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our Sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement our Sponsor entered into specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the Trust Account could be less than $10.10 due to claims or potential claims of creditors.





14







We anticipate notifying the trustee of the Trust Account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after our 18th month and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the founders’ shares and representative shares have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution from the Trust Account with respect to such shares. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the Trust Account. If such funds are insufficient, we will utilize the up to $50,000 of interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account available to us to pay for our liquidation expenses.



If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the initial per-share conversion price would be $10.10. As discussed above, the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public shareholders.



Our public shareholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period, if the shareholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior to consummating an initial business combination. In no other circumstances shall a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account.



If we file a winding-up or bankruptcy petition or an involuntary winding-up or bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable insolvency law and may be included in our insolvency estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any insolvency claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.10 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a winding-up or bankruptcy petition or an involuntary winding-up or bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or insolvency laws as a voidable performance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and the Company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.



Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association



Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our Initial Public Offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company.





15







If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect our public shareholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to convert 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of the IPO, we will provide public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote. This conversion right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our Sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any founders’ shares, representative shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides, among other things, that:




● | we shall either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our shareholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek shareholder approval, an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law is passed, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated within 18 months from the closing of the IPO, then we will convert all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | upon the consummation of the IPO, approximately $115 million including deferred underwriting commissions be placed into the Trust Account;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that participate in any manner in the proceeds of the Trust Account, or that votes as a class with the ordinary shares sold in this offering on an initial business combination.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies similar to our company. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.





16







The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:




● | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert or repurchase ordinary shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------




Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.



If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.



Facilities



We currently maintain our principal executive offices at Hagag Towers, North Tower, Floor 24, Haarba 28, Tel Aviv, Israel. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per-month fee High House, an affiliate of Mr. Cherni, charges us for general and administrative services pursuant to a letter agreement between us and High House. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services, that the fee charged by High House is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. We consider our current office space, combined with the other office space otherwise available to our executive officers, adequate for our current operations.
Employees



We have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the Company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management may spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Available Information



We are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC’s Internet website is located at http://www.sec.gov.

Risk Factors Summary



An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainties. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not limited to:



Risks Relating to Searching for and Consummating a Business Combination




● | Our independent registered public accounting firm’s report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going concern.”
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to convert your shares to cash.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders and management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, and such persons control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert substantial influence over us.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Because of our structure, we may not be able to consummate an attractive business combination.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, our public shareholders may be forced to wait beyond such to 18 months before conversion of their ordinary shares from our Trust Account, which conversion is all they would receive. Their warrants would expire worthless.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In connection with any shareholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require shareholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may seek business combination opportunities with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue, cash flow or earnings, which could subject us to volatile revenues, cash flows or earnings or difficulty in retaining key personnel, and you may be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business’ operations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire and therefore you may be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed business combination.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our shareholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership and adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our shareholders’ investment in us.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may need additional funds to consummate an initial business combination and there is no assurance such funds will be available to us.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and other events, and the status of debt and equity markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






18







Risks Relating to the Post-Business Combination Company




● | We may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company, which could, in turn, negatively impact the value of our shareholders’ investment in us.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | There may be tax consequences to our structure or business combinations that may adversely affect us.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Risks Relating to our Management and Directors




● | Our officers and directors may have conflicts of interest that adversely affect our ability to complete an attractive initial business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Risks Relating to our Securities




● | You do not have any rights or interests in funds from the Trust Account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An investor will may not be able to exercise a warrant by their preferred method under certain circumstances.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants, redeem unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to holders, or require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis which will cause holders to receive fewer ordinary shares upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.

● | If our security holders exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary shares.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Certain occurrences could reduce the value of the assets held in trust such that the per-share conversion amount received by public shareholders may be less than $10.10 per share.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our securities and could entrench management.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Because we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. Federal courts may be limited.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Risks




● | In evaluating a prospective target business for our initial business combination, our management may rely on the availability of all of the funds from the sale of the Forward Purchase Units to be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination. If we fail to sell all or some of the Forward Purchase Units for any reason, we may lack sufficient funds to consummate our initial business combination.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Forward Purchase Investors have the ability to excuse themselves from their obligation to purchase Forward Purchase Units for any reason.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are a company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. If we are unable to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
