Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel targeted therapies for blood-related cancers where there is a significant unmet medical need. Our goal is to build a profitable company by generating income from products we develop and commercialize, either alone or with partners. We have one commercially approved product, VONJO™ (pacritinib), which has received accelerated approval in the United States by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis with a platelet count below 50 x 109/L. 
Our Strategy 
Our objective is to become a leader in the development and commercialization of novel targeted therapeutics for the treatment of blood-related cancers. The key elements of our strategy to achieve these objectives are to:
•Successfully Commercialize VONJO. At the time of VONJO's approval by the FDA in February 2022, our commercial and supply infrastructure was in place to enable a prompt commercial launch of VONJO. We continue to focus our efforts on the commercial capabilities that support the ongoing launch of VONJO in the United States through the coordinated efforts of our sales, marketing and market access teams. 
•Evaluate Strategic Product Collaborations to Accelerate Development and Commercialization. Where we believe it may be beneficial, we intend to evaluate collaborations to broaden and accelerate the clinical trial development and commercialization of VONJO. Collaborations have the potential to generate non-equity based operating capital, supplement our own internal expertise and provide us with access to the marketing, sales and distribution capabilities of our collaborators in specific territories.
•Identify and Acquire Additional Pipeline Opportunities. Historically, we have built our candidate pipeline using multiple approaches, including through licensing and acquiring assets that we believe were initially undervalued opportunities. We plan to continue to seek out additional product candidates in an opportunistic manner.

Oncology Market Overview and Opportunity 
According to the American Cancer Society, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, resulting in more than 600,000 deaths annually, or more than 1,600 deaths per day. Approximately 1.9 million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed in 2022 in the United States. While the exact prevalence of myelofibrosis is uncertain, it is estimated that there are approximately 21,000 myelofibrosis patients in the United States, 7,000 of whom have severe thrombocytopenia (defined as platelet counts of less than 50 x109/L). The most commonly used methods for treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Patients usually receive a combination of these treatments depending upon the type and extent of their disease. 
We believe our expertise in blood-related cancers, together with our ability to identify unique therapies that address unmet medical needs that are potentially less toxic and more effective at treating and curing patients, may fill a significant unmet medical need for cancer patients.
Pacritinib 
4


Overview
Pacritinib is an oral kinase inhibitor with specificity for JAK2, IRAK1, FLT3 and CSF1R. At clinically relevant concentrations, pacritinib does not inhibit JAK1. The JAK family of enzymes is a central component in signal transduction pathways, which are critical to normal blood cell growth and development, as well as inflammatory cytokine expression and immune responses. Mutations in these kinases have been shown to be directly related to the development of a variety of blood-related cancers, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukemia and lymphoma. In addition to myelofibrosis, the kinase profile of pacritinib suggests its potential therapeutic utility in conditions such as acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or CMML, graft versus host disease, or GvHD, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, due to its inhibition of JAK2, IRAK1, FLT3 and CSF1R. We believe pacritinib has the potential to be delivered as a single agent or in combination therapy regimens.
U.S. FDA Approval of VONJO
In September 2020, we reached an agreement with the FDA to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, for the potential accelerated approval of VONJO as a treatment for myelofibrosis patients with severe thrombocytopenia, and in March 2021 we completed our rolling NDA submission. The NDA was based on the available data from our completed Phase 3 PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2 trials and the Phase 2 PAC203 dose-ranging trial. In May 2021, the FDA accepted our NDA and granted pacritinib Priority Review, with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act target action date set for November 30, 2021, which was subsequently extended by three months to February 28, 2022. In February 2022, the FDA granted accelerated approval of VONJO for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis with a platelet count below 50 x 109/L. As agreed with the FDA, the PACIFICA Phase 3 trial will be completed as a post-marketing requirement.
PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2 Trials
Pacritinib was evaluated in two Phase 3 clinical trials, collectively known as the PERSIST program, for patients with myelofibrosis. The PERSIST-1 trial evaluated pacritinib in a broad set of patients without limitations on platelet counts, and the PERSIST-2 trial evaluated pacritinib in patients with low platelet counts. Myelofibrosis is a rare blood cancer associated with significantly reduced quality of life and shortened survival. As the disease progresses, the body slows production of important blood cells and within one year of diagnosis, the incidence of disease-related thrombocytopenia (very low blood platelet counts), severe anemia and red blood cell transfusion requirements increase significantly. Among other complications, most patients with myelofibrosis present with enlarged spleens (splenomegaly), as well as many other potentially devastating physical symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, bone pain, feeling full after eating little, severe itching, night sweats and extreme fatigue. Currently patients with very low blood platelets, so called severe thrombocytopenia, (<50,000/µL) have limited or no effective treatment options. Myelofibrosis patients with severe thrombocytopenia have poor survival following discontinuation of therapy with the approved JAK1/JAK2 therapy. We believe pacritinib may offer effective treatment of splenomegaly and disease-related symptoms in patients with severe thrombocytopenia. 
PERSIST-1 was a randomized (2:1), open-label, multi-center Phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of pacritinib compared to BAT excluding JAK inhibitors, in 327 patients with myelofibrosis, without exclusion for low platelet counts. 
In May 2015, data from PERSIST-1 showed that compared to BAT (exclusive of a JAK inhibitor) pacritinib therapy resulted in a significantly higher proportion of patients with SVR and control of disease-related symptoms meeting the primary endpoint of the trial. Additionally, 25 percent of patients treated with pacritinib who were severely anemic and transfusion dependent - requiring at least six units of blood in the 90 days prior to study entry - became transfusion independent, compared to zero patients treated with BAT (p<0.05). The most common adverse events, occurring in 10 percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within 24 weeks, of any grade, were: mild to moderate diarrhea, nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia and vomiting. Of the patients treated with pacritinib, three discontinued therapy and 13 patients required dose interruption (average one week) for diarrhea. Patients received a daily full dose of pacritinib over the duration of treatment. Gastrointestinal symptoms typically lasted for approximately one week and few patients discontinued treatment due to side effects. There were no Grade 4 gastrointestinal events reported. 
The PERSIST-2 trial was a randomized (2:1), open-label, multi-center registration-directed Phase 3 trial evaluating pacritinib compared to BAT, including the approved JAK inhibitor dosed according to product label, for patients with myelofibrosis whose platelet counts are less than or equal to 100,000 per microliter (≤100,000/µL). The PERSIST-2 trial met one of the co-primary endpoints showing a statistically significant SVR in patients treated with pacritinib combining the once- and twice-daily arms compared to BAT. The PERSIST-2 trial did not meet the other co-primary endpoint of greater than 50 percent reduction in TSS. Although secondary objectives could not be evaluated formally due to the study not achieving one of 
the primary objectives, when the two pacritinib dosing arms were evaluated separately versus BAT, pacritinib given twice daily showed a higher percent of SVR and TSS responses compared to BAT; whereas, pacritinib given once daily showed only a higher percent SVR responses compared to BAT. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, occurring in 20 percent or more of patients treated with pacritinib within 24 weeks, of any grade, were gastrointestinal (generally manageable diarrhea, nausea and vomiting) and hematologic (anemia and thrombocytopenia) and were generally less frequent for BID versus QD administration. The most common serious treatment-emergent adverse events (incidence of ≥5 percent reported in any treatment arm irrespective of grade) were anemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia and acute renal failure none of which exceeded 8 percent individually in any arm. 
In February 2015, we received a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC, in place at the time to terminate the PERSIST-1 trial and hold enrollment of new patients in the PERSIST-2 trial. The IDMC’s recommendation was based on non-statistically significant safety concerns, including mortality, in patients on pacritinib, particularly those who crossover after 24 weeks. On February 8, 2016, the FDA notified us that a full clinical hold had been placed on pacritinib clinical studies.
PAC203 Trial
In January 2017, the FDA removed the full clinical hold following review of our complete response submission which included, among other items, final Clinical Study Reports for both PERSIST-1 and -2 trials and a dose-exploration clinical trial protocol that the FDA requested. At that time, the PAC203 trial was designed to enroll up to approximately 105 patients with primary myelofibrosis and who had failed prior ruxolitinib therapy across three dose regimens of pacritinib, 100 mg QD, 100 mg BID and 200 mg BID, to evaluate the dose response relationship for safety and efficacy (SVR at 12 and 24 weeks). The 200 mg BID dose was selected as the top dose based upon observations from the completed PERSIST-2 study. In PAC203, the entry criteria were modified to exclude patients with a history of cardiac and/or bleeding events and additional dose modification guidelines were implemented for the management of treatment-emergent cardiac and or bleeding events. The first patient in the PAC203 trial was enrolled in July 2017. 
In April 2018, we amended the protocol to expand the sample size to a maximum of 150 patients (or 50 patients per arm) to collect additional data for the safety and efficacy analyses. In July 2018, we announced that the IDMC for the PAC203 trial completed its planned interim data review of the PAC203 trial and that the IDMC did not identify any drug- or dose-related safety concerns and did not identify any concerns about cardiac or bleeding events. Following meetings with the FDA and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and consultation with the IDMC, we eliminated the interim efficacy analysis and focused the second interim data review, and all subsequent data reviews, on an assessment of safety. The protocol was amended to reflect this change and submitted to FDA. In October 2018, we announced the continuation of the PAC203 Phase 2 study without modification, following a planned second interim data review by the IDMC. The IDMC did not identify significant drug- or dose-related safety concerns and specifically did not identify any concerns around hemorrhagic or cardiac toxicity. A complete dataset from the fully enrolled study (including efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data) will be used to determine the optimal dose of pacritinib for further clinical development, as requested by the FDA. The PAC203 study was fully enrolled in December 2018. In January 2019, the IDMC completed its planned third interim safety review and recommended that the study continue without modification. 
In December 2019, we announced top-line efficacy and safety data for the PAC203 trial. Pacritinib was shown to be generally well tolerated across dosing cohorts. The majority of non-hematological adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and, with the exception of diarrhea, were considered unlikely related to pacritinib. The most common non-hematologic adverse events were gastrointestinal, including diarrhea (23.6%) and nausea (23.6%), and occurred more commonly in patients treated at 200 mg BID (31/54, 57.4%) than at lower doses (100 mg BID: 23/55, 41.8%, 100 mg QD: 22/52, 42.3%). These events were largely grade 1 or 2 in severity. Diarrhea was generally manageable with standard antidiarrheal agents, and only one patient (at 200mg BID) required drug discontinuation due to any gastrointestinal event (diarrhea). 
The most common hematologic adverse events were thrombocytopenia and anemia, both occurring at higher frequencies at the 200 mg BID dose (35.2 percent and 24.1 percent respectively); this did not, however, lead to higher rates of Grade 3/4 hemorrhage at higher doses (200 mg BID: 5.6 percent; 100 mg BID: 0 percent; 100 mg QD: 7.7 percent; all Grade 3). Similarly, the highest dose saw no excess in Grade 3/4 cardiac (200 mg BID: 3.7 percent; 100 mg BID: 7.3 percent; 100 mg QD: 5.8; all grade 3). There were 10 Grade 5 (fatal) adverse events: 3 at 200 mg BID (sepsis, respiratory failure, subdural hematoma), 3 at 100 mg BID (disease progression, subdural hemorrhage, heart failure), and 4 at 100 mg QD (disease progression, general physical health deterioration, sepsis, tuberculosis).
The 200 mg BID arm had the highest observed rates of SVR ≥35 percent (200 mg BID: 9.3 percent; 100 mg BID: 1.8 percent; 100 mg QD: 0.0 percent). Of the 5 patients with SVR ≥35 percent at the 200 mg BID dose, 4 had platelet counts 
<50,000/µL, representing a 17 percent (4/24) response rate among patients with severe thrombocytopenia. Though a dose response relationship was not observed in total symptom score (TSS) based on the threshold of 50 percent reduction in symptom score, the median percent decrease in TSS (including fatigue) did show deeper reductions with escalating doses, with best response at 200 mg BID. At Week 24, the percent change in TSS from baseline was highest in the 200 mg pacritinib BID group (median ‑27.3%) compared with the other treatment groups (100 mg pacritinib BID group: median ‑16.0%; 100 mg pacritinib QD group: median ‑3.1%). Of the TSS (including fatigue) responders, baseline cytopenias were common: 8 of 12 had hemoglobin <10g/dL, and 4 of 12 had platelet counts <50,000/µL.
PACIFICA Phase 3 Trial
In January 2020, we received the FDA's preliminary comments from a Type A meeting request and reached an agreement on the final design changes to our PACIFICA pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, including changes to the statistical analysis plan that would allow for a potential accelerated approval pathway for VONJO. We amended our PACIFICA Phase 3 trial protocol, to allow for the primary analysis of Spleen Volume Reduction, or SVR, rate on the first 168 patients, with an end-of-study analysis of Total Symptom Score, or TSS, and Overall Survival, or OS, following the full enrollment of 348 patients. Enrollment in this trial is progressing despite the challenges of conducting clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic. As agreed with the FDA, following the accelerated approval of VONJO, we plan to complete the PACIFICA Phase 3 trial as a post-marketing requirement, with expected results in mid-2025. 
PRE-VENT Phase 3 Trial 
In April 2020, in response to the public health crisis due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated PRE-VENT, a Phase 3 trial evaluating pacritinib in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. PRE-VENT, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study will compare pacritinib plus Standard of Care, or SOC, versus placebo plus SOC in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, including those with a current or prior diagnosis of cancer. The primary endpoint of the trial will assess the proportion of patients who progress to invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or die by Day 28. We commenced enrollment of PRE-VENT in the second quarter of 2020 in the United States and reported top-line data from final analysis from the PRE-VENT trial in October 2021. As a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or death by Day 28 was not demonstrated, we decided not to pursue further development of pacritinib for the treatment of severe COVID-19.
aGvHD Phase 1 Trial
In March 2021, results were published from an Investigator Sponsored Phase 1 trial conducted by Joseph Pidala, MD, PhD (Moffitt Cancer Center), and Brian C. Betts, MD (Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota), evaluating pacritinib for the prevention of acute GvHD, or aGvHD. The results demonstrated that pacritinib, combined with sirolimus and low-dose tacrolimus (PAC/SIR/TAC), has a promising safety profile and exhibits preliminary therapeutic activity in preventing aGvHD after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation from HLA matched related and unrelated donors. Enrollment on the Phase 2 portion of the trial, designed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of pacritinib in combination with sirolimus and low-dose tacrolimus for aGvHD prevention, has recently been suspended due to futility without any report of safety concerns. 
License Agreements 
Baxalta
In November 2013, we entered into a Development, Commercialization and License Agreement, dated as of November 14, 2013, with Baxter International Inc., or Baxter, for the development and commercialization of pacritinib for use in oncology and potentially additional therapeutic areas, or the Pacritinib License Agreement, which was subsequently amended in June 2015. Baxter assigned its rights and obligations under the Pacritinib License Agreement to Baxalta. Under the Pacritinib License Agreement, we granted to Baxter an exclusive, worldwide (subject to co-promotion rights discussed below), royalty-bearing, non-transferable, and (under certain circumstances outside of the United States) sub-licensable license to our know-how and patents relating to pacritinib.
In October 2016, we entered into the Asset Return and Termination Agreement, or the Baxalta Termination Agreement, with Baxalta. Pursuant to the Baxalta Termination Agreement, the Pacritinib License Agreement was terminated in its entirety (other than with respect to certain customary provisions that survive termination, including those pertaining to confidentiality and indemnification), the Pacritinib License Agreement has no further force or effect, and all rights and obligations of the Company and Baxalta under the Pacritinib License Agreement were terminated.
In October 2016, we resumed primary responsibility for the development and commercialization of pacritinib as a result of the Baxalta Termination Agreement and are no longer eligible to receive cost sharing or milestone payments for pacritinib’s development from Baxalta. 
Baxalta was acquired by Shire plc in 2016, and Shire plc was subsequently acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, in 2019. Pursuant to the Baxalta Termination Agreement, we are required to make a milestone payment to Takeda in the amount of approximately $10.3 million upon the first regulatory approval or any pricing and reimbursement approvals of a product containing pacritinib. Subsequent to FDA approval of VONJO in February 2022, the $10.3 million milestone payment has become payable to Takeda.
S*BIO
We acquired the compounds SB1518 (which is referred to as “pacritinib”) and SB1578, which inhibit JAK2 and FLT3, from S*BIO in May 2012. Under our agreement with S*BIO, we are required to make milestone payments to S*BIO up to an aggregate amount of $132.5 million if certain U.S., EU and Japanese regulatory approvals are obtained and if certain worldwide net sales thresholds are met in connection with any pharmaceutical product containing or comprising any compound that we acquired from S*BIO for use for specific diseases, infections or other conditions. In addition, S*BIO will be entitled to receive royalty payments from us at incremental rates in the low single-digits based on certain worldwide net sales thresholds on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Subsequent to FDA approval of VONJO in February 2022, a $25.0 million milestone payment has become payable to S*BIO. At our election, we may pay up to 50% of any milestone payments to S*BIO through the issuance of shares of our common stock or shares of our preferred stock automatically convertible into our common stock.
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.
In June 2005, we entered into an acquisition agreement with Cephalon, Inc., or Cephalon, pursuant to which we divested the compound, TRISENOX. Cephalon was subsequently acquired by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva. Under this agreement, we have the right to receive up to $100 million in payments upon achievement by Teva of specified sales and development milestones related to TRISENOX. To date, we have received $60.0 million of such potential milestone payments as a result of Teva having achieved certain sales milestones. The achievement of the remaining milestones is uncertain at this time. 
Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights 
We dedicate significant resources to protecting our intellectual property, which is important to our business. We have filed numerous patent applications in the United States and various other countries seeking protection of inventions originating from our research and development, and we have also obtained rights to various patents and patent applications under licenses with third parties and through acquisitions. We have pending patent applications or issued patents in the United States and foreign countries directed to pacritinib and other product candidates. Patent coverage for our individual products extends for varying periods according to the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where we have obtained patent protection.
Our U.S. and foreign composition of matter patents for pacritinib expire as follows: U.S. patents expire in May 2028 (method) / January 2029 (compound) / March 2030 (salt); foreign patents expire in November 2026 (method and compound) / December 2029 (salt). We expect that any patents issued from our U.S. and foreign patent applications for use of pacritinib for treating transplant rejection will expire in 2036. 
Each patent in our portfolio may be eligible for patent term restoration of up to five years under certain circumstances. Also, regulatory exclusivity tied to the protection of clinical data may be complementary to patent protection. During a period of regulatory exclusivity, competitors generally may not use the original applicant’s data as the basis for a generic application. In the United States, the data protection generally runs for five years from first marketing approval of a new chemical entity, which period is extended to seven years for an orphan drug indication. Pacritinib has orphan drug designation for myelofibrosis in the United States and the European Union, or EU. 
In addition to our patent rights, we rely, to the extent possible, on trade secrets and contractual protections for our know-how and other unpatented technology. Ultimately, to the extent any of our product candidates are not protected by patent rights, our competitors would be free to use inventions embodied in our product candidates to which they have access to compete with us.
The risks and uncertainties associated with our intellectual property, including our patents, are discussed in more detail in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Manufacturing, Distribution and Associated Operations
Our manufacturing strategy utilizes third party contractors for the procurement and manufacture, as applicable, of raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product, as well as for labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of our compounds and associated supply chain operations. As a result of the February 2022 FDA approval of VONJO and the continued expansion of our clinical development activities, we expect that our manufacturing, distribution and related operational requirements will increase correspondingly. Additionally, in October 2016, we resumed primary responsibility for the development and commercialization of pacritinib as a result of the termination of the Pacritinib License Agreement. The development and commercialization of a major product candidate like pacritinib without a collaborative partner has significantly increased our manufacturing, distribution and related operational requirements, and we expect such increases to continue as we advance the clinical development of pacritinib.
Each third party contractor undergoes a formal qualification process by our subject matter experts prior to our entry into any service agreement and initiating any manufacturing work. We currently have a commercial supply arrangement for pacritinib.
Integral to our manufacturing strategy is our quality control and quality assurance program, which includes standard operating procedures and specifications with the goal that our compounds are manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and other applicable global regulations. The cGMP compliance includes strict adherence to regulations for quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities for products and product candidates must meet cGMP requirements, and commercialized products must have acquired FDA, EMA and any other applicable regulatory approval. In this regard, we expect to continue to rely on contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our compounds in accordance with cGMPs for use in clinical trials and distribution.
We believe our operational strategy of utilizing qualified outside vendors in the foregoing manner allows us to direct our financial and managerial resources to development and commercialization activities, rather than to the establishment and maintenance of a manufacturing and distribution infrastructure.
Competition 
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. We face competition from a variety of companies focused on developing oncology drugs. We compete with large pharmaceutical companies and with other specialized biotechnology companies. In addition to the specific competitive factors discussed below, new anti-cancer drugs that may be developed and marketed in the future could compete with our various compounds.
Pacritinib may face competition from the currently approved JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors, Jakafi® / Jakavi® (ruxolitinib) and Inrebic® (fedratinib) as well as BESREMi® (ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft). In August 2019, Celgene (which was subsequently acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb) announced FDA approval of Inrebic® for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis, and in February 2021 Bristol Myers Squibb announced the European Commission, or EC, approval of Inrebic®. In November 2021, PharmaEssentia announced FDA approval of BESREMi® for the treatment of adults with polycythemia vera. Pacritinib may also face competition from momelotinib, which Sierra Oncology acquired from Gilead. In June 2019, Sierra Oncology announced that momelotinib was granted fast track designation by the FDA and launched a Phase 3 clinical trial in November 2019. In June 2021, Sierra Oncology announced that the Phase 3 trial enrollment has been completed and in January 2022, Sierra Oncology announced top-line data from the Phase 3 trial and their intentions to file an NDA in the U.S. for the approval of momelotinib.
Some of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than us and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of these competitors have products that have been approved or are in development and operate large, well-funded research and development programs.
Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage if their products work through a similar mechanism as our 
products and if the approved indications are similar. A number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new products for the treatment of the same diseases being targeted by us. In some instances, such products have already entered late-stage clinical trials or received FDA or EC approval. However, cancer drugs with distinctly different mechanisms of action are often used together in combination for treating cancer, allowing several different products to target the same cancer indication or disease type. Such combination therapy is typically supported by clinical trials that demonstrate the advantage of combination therapy over that of a single-agent treatment.
We believe that our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology, develop proprietary products, attract and retain scientific personnel, obtain patent or other protection for our products, obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market our products, either alone or through outside parties. We will continue to seek licenses with respect to technology related to our field of interest and may face competition with respect to such efforts. See the risk factor, “We face direct and intense competition from our competitors in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may not compete successfully against them.” in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties we face due to competition in our industry. 
Government Regulation 
We are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products. In addition to FDA regulation, we are also subject to additional legal and regulatory requirements at both the federal and state levels in the United States. Our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the EU are addressed in a centralized way through the EMA and the EC, but country-specific regulation by the competent authorities of the EU member states remains essential in many respects.
U.S. Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, including through review and approval of NDAs. NDAs require extensive studies and submission of a large amount of data by the applicant. There are also additional laws and regulations, administered by the FDA and other government agencies, that are applicable to the development, approval, manufacture, marketing, promotion, sale, pricing and distribution of drugs.
Drug Development
Preclinical Testing. Before testing any compound in human subjects in the United States, a company must generate extensive preclinical data. Preclinical testing generally includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in several animal species to assess the quality and safety of the product. Animal studies must be performed in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act.
IND Application. Human clinical trials in the United States cannot commence until an IND application is submitted and becomes effective. A company must submit preclinical testing results to the FDA as part of the IND application, and the FDA must evaluate whether there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in initial clinical studies in human volunteers. Unless the FDA raises concerns, the IND application becomes effective 30 calendar days following its receipt by the FDA. Once human clinical trials have commenced, the FDA may stop the clinical trials by placing them on “clinical hold” because of concerns about the safety of the product being tested, or for other reasons.
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients, under the supervision of a qualified investigator. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation, including compliance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the study objectives, parameters for monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol is reviewed by the FDA as part of the IND application. In addition, each clinical trial must be reviewed, approved, and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board, or IRB, at the institution conducting the clinical trial. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with 
regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial and timely reporting adverse events. Foreign studies conducted under an IND application must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the United States. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND application may be submitted in support of an NDA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and the FDA is able to validate the data.
A study sponsor is required to submit certain details about active clinical trials and clinical trial results to the National Institutes of Health for public posting on http://clinicaltrials.gov. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another:
•Phase 1 clinical trials include the initial administration of the investigational drug to humans, typically to a small group of healthy human subjects, but occasionally to a group of patients with the targeted disease or disorder. Phase 1 clinical trials generally are intended to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase 2 clinical trials generally are controlled studies that involve a relatively small sample of the intended patient population, and are designed to develop data regarding the product’s effectiveness, to determine dose response and the optimal dose range and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
•Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about safety and effectiveness necessary to evaluate the drug’s overall risk-benefit profile, and to provide a basis for physician labeling. Generally, Phase 3 clinical development programs consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of a biological product, at the proposed dosing regimen.
The sponsoring company, the FDA or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Further, success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.
The FDA and IND application sponsor may agree in writing on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim in an NDA application. This process is known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA. These agreements may not be changed after the clinical trials begin, except in limited circumstances. The existence of a SPA, however, does not assure approval of a product candidate. For additional information relating to drug development, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Drug Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the investigational product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial review user fee to the FDA. The FDA will review the application and may deem it to be inadequate to support commercial marketing, and there can be no assurance that any product approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also seek the advice of an advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians practicing in the field for which the product is intended, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee. Companies are not permitted to market drugs in the United States until receiving approval of an NDA or BLA from the FDA.
The FDA has various programs, including breakthrough therapy, fast track, priority review and accelerated approval, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for one or more of these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments. 
Before approving a NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities where the product is manufactured, tested and distributed and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. If the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities as acceptable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. When and if those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The 
approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy, or impose other post-approval commitment conditions.

In some circumstances, post-marketing testing may include post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, which are used primarily to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended population, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. In addition, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks. A REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk mitigation tools.
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical trials be conducted. For additional information relating to drug development, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Post-Approval FDA Requirements
Holders of an approved NDA are required to: (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA; (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products; and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing and distribution facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production, quality control and distribution to maintain cGMP compliance. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at manufacturing facilities that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical holds, FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or supplemental applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. For additional information relating to post-approval requirements, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Advertising and Promotion
Under the FDCA and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses, or uses not approved by the FDA. This means that in the U.S., we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the uses of our products that are not approved by the FDA, unless otherwise allowed by the FDA by policy or other guidance. Marketing of prescription drugs is also subject to additional laws and regulations through federal and state agencies tasked with consumer protection. After approval in the U.S., we must comply with these law and regulations, as well as FDA’s regulation of drug promotion and advertising, including restrictions on off-label promotion. For additional information relating to restrictions related to advertising and promotion, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Health Care Fraud and Abuse
As a result of approval for VONJO in the United States, our operations and business arrangements with third-parties (including but not limited to researchers, healthcare professionals, consultants, payors, and customers) are subject to additional healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement by federal and state governments in the United States. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws. 
Anti-Kickback Laws
The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits companies and individuals from offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or reward referrals of business that will be paid for by federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. We are also required to comply with other state anti-kickback statutes and other limitations on gifts and payments to physicians and reporting of payments to certain third parties, among other requirements. Failure to abide by anti-kickback statutes can result in civil and criminal enforcement actions and/or sanctions. Likewise, federal and state false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act and similar state statutes, prohibit knowingly submitting, or causing to be submitted, false claims or false or fraudulent statements material to a false claim to government health care programs. Pharmaceutical companies are frequent targets of false claims lawsuits, which may result in treble damages, penalties, and 
potential exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, and civil monetary penalty statutes often overlap and may also be enforced in conjunction. For additional information relating to our obligations under health care fraud and abuse laws, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission jointly enforce the FCPA, and those agencies have, in recent years, emphasized FCPA enforcement against pharmaceutical companies. In some countries, we may interact with health care professionals or other officials that meet the definition of a foreign government official for the purposes of the FCPA. We are subject to the FCPA’s prohibitions against unauthorized payments or offers of payments by our employees or agents. If we were determined to have violated the FCPA, we could be subject to substantial fines, penalties, and other legal or equitable sanctions. For additional information relating to our obligations under the FCPA and anti-bribery laws, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Third-Party Reimbursement
The coverage and reimbursement status of VONJO is subject to significant uncertainty. Sales of and revenue from VONJO will depend on coverage and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors, including government health programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for VONJO can be subject to challenge, reduction, or denial by payors. Government health programs, private insurers, are increasingly trying to reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals, and any future legislative, regulatory, or contractual developments could affect the coverage and reimbursement status of VONJO. For additional information relating to product reimbursement, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Data Privacy and Protection
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and implementing regulations, create requirements relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA regulations govern the manner in which certain health information may be used and disclosed, and require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA and HITECH requirements are applicable to covered entities, which are (1) health plans, (2) health care clearinghouses, and (3) health care providers who electronically transmit certain health information. Those requirements are also applicable, in many instances, to business associates of covered entities. In some cases, depending on our business operations and contractual agreements, including through the conduct of clinical trials, we are subject to HIPPA requirements. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations can result in significant fines, penalties, damages, loss of goodwill or business opportunities, and reputational harm. There are also additional federal, state, and local privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. that may apply to us now or in the future and that require that we take measures to protect the privacy and security of certain information we gather and use in our business. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The law requires businesses collecting information about California consumers to disclose what personal information is collected about a consumer and the purposes for which that personal information is used, disclose what personal information is sold or shared for a business purpose, and to whom, and delete information or stop selling such information upon request (subject to exceptions). For additional information relating to our obligations under data privacy laws, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Non-U.S. Regulation 
Before our medicinal products can be marketed outside of the United States, they must be subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the United States. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, including requirements to conduct additional clinical trials, product licensing, safety reporting, post-authorization requirements, marketing and promotion, interactions with healthcare professionals, pricing and reimbursement may vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate approval application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing 
review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product.
Conduct of clinical trials in the European Union
Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. The conduct of clinical trials is currently governed by the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or Clinical Trials Directive, and will be replaced by the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014, or CTR, once the latter comes into effect. The CTR introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU. It entered into force on January 31, 2022.
Under the current regime, which will expire after a transition period of one or three years, as outlined below in more detail, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each EU Member State where the trial is to be conducted. The approval must be obtained from two separate entities: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees. The NCA of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial will be conducted must authorize the conduct of the trial, and the independent Ethics Committee must grant a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the clinical trial in the relevant EU Member State before the commencement of the trial. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be submitted to or approved by the relevant NCA and Ethics Committees. Under the current regime, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and to the Ethics Committees of the EU Member State where they occur.
A more unified procedure will apply under the new CTR. A sponsor will be able to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial through a centralized EU clinical trials portal. One national regulatory authority (the reporting EU Member State proposed by the applicant) will take the lead in validating and evaluating the application and consult and coordinate with the other concerned EU Member States. If an application is rejected, it may be amended and resubmitted through the EU clinical trials portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor may start the clinical trial in all concerned EU Member States. However, a concerned EU Member State may in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval and prevent the clinical trial from being conducted in such EU Member State. The CTR also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database. After several postponements of the effectiveness of the CTR due to technical difficulties with the underlying IT systems, the “go live” of these systems and, accordingly, the coming into force of the regulation, is planned for January 31, 2022. While EU Member States will work in the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS, immediately after the system has gone live, the CTR provides for two transition periods for sponsors: For one year, until January 31, 2023, clinical trial sponsors can still choose whether to submit an initial clinical trial application in line with the current system (Clinical Trials Directive) or via CTIS. After January 31, 2023, submission of initial clinical trial applications via CTIS becomes mandatory, and by January 31, 2025, all ongoing trials approved under the current Clinical Trials Directive will be governed by the new Regulation and have to be transitioned to CTIS.
Under both the current regime and the new CTR, national laws, regulations, and the applicable GCP and Good Laboratory Practice standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials, including the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use guidelines on GCP and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
During the development of a medicinal product, the European Medical Agency, or EMA, and national regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, on the recommendation of the Scientific Advice Working Party. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure, but is significantly reduced for designated orphan medicines. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application, or MAA, of the product concerned.
In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product are obligated to study their product in children and must therefore submit a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, together with a request for agreement to the EMA. The EMA issues a decision on the PIP based on an opinion of the EMA’s Pediatric Committee. Companies must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with the PIP approved by the EMA, unless a deferral (e.g., until enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults is available) or waiver (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults) has been granted by the EMA. The MAA for the medicinal product must include the results of all pediatric clinical trials performed and details of all information collected in compliance with the approved PIP, unless a waiver or a deferral has been granted, in 
which case the pediatric clinical trials may be completed at a later date. Medicinal products that are granted a marketing authorization, or MA, on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the approved PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the approved PIP are developed and submitted. An approved PIP is also required when a MA holder wants to add a new indication, medicinal form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights.
Marketing authorization procedures in the European Union and post-marketing obligations
In the EU and in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein (together, the European Economic Area, or EEA), medicinal products may only be placed on the market after a related MA has been granted. MAs for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process. These are through the centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure, the decentralized procedure, or a national procedure (for medicinal products sold in a single EU Member State only). The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA by the EC that is valid for all EU Member States and, after respective national implementing decisions, in the three additional EEA countries. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including for medicines developed by means of certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMP, and medicinal products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases (AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases). It is optional for medicinal products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the EEA, and for medicinal products that constitute significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovations, or for which grant of a MA through the centralized procedure would be in the interest of patients or animal health at EU level. The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the EMA which will provide a positive opinion regarding the application if it meets certain quality, safety, and efficacy requirements. Based on the positive opinion of the CHMP at EMA, the EC has final authority for granting the MA within 67 days after receipt of the CHMP opinion to grant a centralized MA which is valid in all 28 EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).
The decentralized authorization procedure permits companies to file identical MAAs to the competent authorities in several EU Member States simultaneously if such a medicinal product has not received marketing approval in any EU Member State before. This procedure is available for medicinal products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The competent authority of a single EU Member State, known as the Reference EU Member State, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference EU Member State and concerned EU Member States. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required to grant MA for their territories on the basis of this assessment. If an EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the EC, whose decision is binding for all EU Member States. 
The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States. The national MA procedure is founded on the same basic EU regulatory process as the other MA procedures discussed herein. The national MA procedure, which is increasingly rare, permits a company to submit an application to the competent authority of a single EU Member State and, if successful, to obtain a MA that is valid only in this EU Member State.
The initial MA granted in the EU is valid for five years. The authorization may be renewed and remain valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority or the EC decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five year renewal period; applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires. The renewal of a MA is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities or the EMA.
Similar to accelerated approval regulations in the United States, conditional MAs can be granted in the EU by the EC in exceptional circumstances. A conditional MA can be granted for medicinal products where, although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product have not been supplied, a number of criteria are fulfilled; (i) the benefit/risk balance of the product is positive, (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data, (iii) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled by the grant of the MA and (iv) the benefit to public 
health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional MA must be renewed annually. 
As in the United States, it may be possible to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity in the EU that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic, hybrid or biosimilar product (even if the medicinal product has already received a MA) and prohibiting another applicant from relying on the MA holder’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data in support of another MA for the purposes of submitting an application, obtaining MA or placing the product on the market. New chemical entities, or NCE, approved in the EU qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity.
An additional non-cumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if, during the data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies.
The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first MA in the EU. After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the MA holder’s data. However, a generic product cannot launch until two years later (or a total of 10 years after the first MA in the EU of the innovator product), or three years later (or a total of 11 years after the first MA in the EU of the innovator product) if the MA holder obtains MA for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the eight-year data exclusivity period. Additionally, another noncumulative one-year period of data exclusivity can be added to the eight years of data exclusivity where an application is made for a new indication for a well-established substance, provided that significant pre-clinical or clinical studies were carried out in relation to the new indication. Another year of data exclusivity may be added to the eight years, where a change of classification of a medicinal product has been authorized on the basis of significant pre-trial tests or clinical trials (when examining an application by another applicant for or holder of market authorization for a change of classification of the same substance the competent authority will not refer to the results of those tests or trials for one year after the initial chance was authorized).
Products may not be granted data exclusivity since there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to include a NCE. Even if a compound is considered to be a NCE and the MA applicant is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the medicinal product if such company can complete a full MA application with their own complete database of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain MA of its product.
PRIME Designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies on the basis of compelling non-clinical data and tolerability data from initial clinical trials. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and potentially accelerated MA application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, once a candidate medicine has been selected for the PRIME scheme, a dedicated contact point and rapporteur from the CHMP or from CAT are appointed facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. A kick-off meeting with the CHMP/CAT rapporteur initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts to provide guidance on the overall development plan and regulatory strategy. PRIME eligibility does not change the standards for product approval, and there is no assurance that any such designation or eligibility will result in expedited review or approval.
Pricing and reimbursement in the European Union
Even if a medicinal product obtains a MA in the EU, there can be no assurance that reimbursement for such product will be secured on a timely basis or at all. The EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the medicinal product, or alternatively, may adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms.
Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical study or other 
studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, if any, to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for medicinal products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, medicinal products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally published and actual prices tend to be significantly lower. Publication of discounts by third party payers or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.
The so-called health technology assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. The HTA process, which is governed by the national laws of these countries, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact, and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the regulatory authorities of individual EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of our products by a leading and recognized HTA body could not only undermine our ability to obtain reimbursement for such product in the EU Member State in which such negative assessment was issued, but also in other EU Member States. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms could rely to some extent on the HTA performed in other countries with a developed HTA framework, when adopting decisions concerning the pricing and reimbursement of a specific medicinal product.
On January 31, 2018, the EC adopted a proposal for a regulation on HTA. This legislative proposal is intended to boost EU-level cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The proposal provides that EU Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. While EU Member States could choose to delay participation in the joint work until three years after the rules enter into force, it would become mandatory after six years. The EC has stated that the role of the draft HTA regulation is not to influence pricing and reimbursement decisions in the individual EU Member States, but there can be no assurance that the draft HTA regulation will not have effects on pricing and reimbursement decisions. The HTA entered into force on January 11, 2022 and applies as of January 2025 followed by a further three-year transitional period during which EU member states must fully adapt to the new system.
To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, including the EU Member States, we may be required to conduct studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other therapies that are considered the local standard of care. There can be no assurance that any country will allow favorable pricing, reimbursement and market access conditions for any of our products, or that it will be feasible to conduct additional cost-effectiveness studies, if required.
In certain of the EU Member States, medicinal products that are designated as orphan medicinal products may be exempted or waived from having to provide certain clinical, cost-effectiveness and other economic data in connection with their filings for pricing/reimbursement approval.
Post-Approval Regulation
Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the EC and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing licenses and MAs. It includes control of compliance with EU good manufacturing practice, or GMP, rules, manufacturing authorizations, pharmacovigilance rules and requirements governing advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution, recordkeeping, importing and exporting of medicinal products.
Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to comply with EU laws and the related national laws of individual EU Member States governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of MA, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal 
penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
The holder of a MA for a medicinal product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. These pharmacovigilance rules can impose on holders of MAs the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed medicinal products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies or post-authorization safety studies to obtain further information on a medicine’s safety, or to measure the effectiveness of risk-management measures, which may be time consuming and expensive and could impact our profitability. MA holders must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of Periodic Safety Update Reports, or PSURs, in relation to medicinal products for which they hold MAs. The EMA reviews PSURs for medicinal products authorized through the centralized procedure. If the EMA has concerns that the risk benefit profile of a product has varied, it can adopt an opinion advising that the existing MA for the product be suspended, withdrawn or varied. The agency can advise that the MA holder be obliged to conduct post-authorization Phase IV safety studies. If the EC agrees with the opinion, it can adopt a decision varying the existing MA. Failure by the MA holder to fulfill the obligations for which the EC’s decision provides can undermine the ongoing validity of the MA.
More generally, non-compliance with pharmacovigilance obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the MA for the product or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures. 
The manufacturing process for medicinal products in the EU is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the EC guidelines for GMP. These requirements include compliance with EU GMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products into and within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. The manufacturer or importer must have a qualified person who is responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured in accordance with GMP, before releasing the product for commercial distribution in the EU or for use in a clinical trial. Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the competent authorities for compliance with GMP.. Companies may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions. These include suspension of manufacturing authorization in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU Member States’ requirements governing the manufacturing of medicinal products.
Sales and Marketing Regulations
In the EU, the advertising and promotion of our products are also subject to EU laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other national legislation of individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products and may differ from one country to another. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent regulatory authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. It forms an intrinsic and integral part of the MA granted for the medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved SmPC and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited in the EU. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.
Anti-Corruption Legislation
Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010.
In the EU, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct both at the EU level and in the individual EU Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States also must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her regulatory professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Data Privacy and Protection 
The collection and use of personal health data and other personal information in the EU is governed by the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR, which came into force in May 2018, and related implementing laws in individual EU Member States.
The GDPR imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to process (processing includes collection, analysis and transfer of) personal data of individuals within the EU and in the EEA, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. The GDPR also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. EU Member States may also impose additional requirements in relation to health, genetic and biometric data through their national implementing legislation. 
Under the GDPR, personal data can only be transferred within the EU Member States and the three additional EEA countries (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) that have adopted a national law implementing the GDPR. Appropriate safeguards are required to enable cross-border transfers of personal data from the EU and EEA countries to a “third country” (a country outside the EU or EEA). This status has a number of significant practical consequences, in particular for international data transfers, competent supervisory authorities and enforcement of the GDPR.
In conclusion, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU/EEA (including the United States) that are not considered by the EC to provide an adequate level of data protection, except if the data controller meets very specific requirements such as the use of standard contractual clauses, or SCCs, issued by the EC. In this respect, recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from the EU/EEA. For example, following the Schrems II decision of the Court of Justice of the EU on July 16, 2020, in which the Court invalidated the Privacy Shield under which personal data could be transferred from the EU/EEA to United States entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme, there is uncertainty as to the general permissibility of international data transfers under the GDPR. The Court did not invalidate the then-current SCCs, but ruled that data exporters relying on these SCCs are required to verify, on a case-by-case basis, if the law of the third country ensures an adequate level of data protection that is essentially equivalent to that guaranteed in the EU/EEA. In light of the implications of this decision, we may face difficulties regarding the transfer of personal data from the EU/EEA to third countries. However, on June 4, 2021 the EC issued a new set of SCCs for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA. These SCCs replace the old sets of SCCs that were adopted under the previous European Data Protection Directive 95/46. Since September 27, 2021, it is no longer possible to conclude contracts incorporating these previous versions of the SCCs. In addition, for contracts concluded before September 27, 2021, it is still possible to rely on the previous SCCs until the end of an additional 15 months transitional period (until December 27, 2022), provided that the processing operations which are the subject matter of the contract remain unchanged and reliance on previous SCCs ensures that the transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards. On November 11, 2021, the European Data Protection Board adopted recommendations on such appropriate safeguards that supplement transfer mechanisms. These recommendations aim to assist data exporters with their duty to identify and implement appropriate supplementary measures where they are needed to ensure an essentially equivalent level of protection to the personal data they transfer to third countries.
The GDPR also regulates our response in the event of a data breach impacting any personal data we process, whether on our or our vendors’ systems. In addition to the disruptions to our business and impact to our reputation that any such security incident could cause, we may be subject to regulatory fines, class actions, or other costly measures if there is a security breach on our or our vendors’ systems. We maintain cyber-liability insurance, however, that insurance may be insufficient to fully cover the losses associated with such a breach, including any resulting regulatory fines
Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, other administrative penalties and a number of criminal offenses (punishable by uncapped fines) for organizations and, in certain cases, their directors and officers, as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may still implement certain variations, enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU. Guidance developed at both the EU level and at the national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised.
Furthermore, there is a growing trend towards the required public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU, which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to processing health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new EU CTR, EMA disclosure initiatives and voluntary commitments by industry. Failing to comply with these obligations could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties against us, harm to our reputation, and adversely impact our business and operating results. The uncertainty regarding the interplay between different regulatory frameworks, such as the CTR and the GDPR, further adds to the complexity that we face with regard to data protection regulation.
With regard to the transfer of data from the EU to the United Kingdom, or UK, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperating Agreement, or TCA, provided for a transition period of up to six months as of January 1, 2021 to enable the EC to complete its adequacy assessment of the UK’s data protection laws. On June 28, 2021 the EC adopted two adequacy decisions for the UK – one under the GDPR and the other for the Law Enforcement Directive. Personal data may now freely flow from the EU to the UK since the UK is deemed to have an adequate data protection level. Additionally, following the UK's withdrawal from the EU and the EEA, companies also have to comply with the UK’s data protection laws (including the UK GDPR, which is based on the EU GDPR), the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The adequacy decisions include a ‘sunset clause’ which entails that the decisions will automatically expire four years after their entry into force.
Other Markets (UK)
The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 and the transition period, during which EU laws continued to apply to the UK, expired on December 31, 2020. This means EU laws now only apply to the UK in respect of Northern Ireland as laid out in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. Following the end of the transition period, the TCA applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 and entered into force on May 1, 2021.
The TCA includes provisions affecting the life sciences sector (including on customs and tariffs) but areas for further discussion between the EU and the UK remain. In addition, there are some specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals. These include the mutual recognition of GMP and issued GMP documents. The TCA does not, however, contain wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations and product standards.
Since January 1, 2021, the EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable in the UK as “retained EU law”. As there is no general power to amend these regulations, the UK government has enacted the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021. The purpose of the act is to enable the existing regulatory frameworks in relation to human medicines, clinical trials of human medicines, veterinary medicines and medical devices to be updated. The powers under the act may only be exercised in relation to specified matters and must safeguard public health.
Specified provisions of the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 entered into force on February 11, 2021. The remaining provisions came into effect within two months of February 11, 2021 or will otherwise come into effect as stipulated in subsequent statutory instruments. The Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 supplements the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002, or UK Regulations, which are based on the EU Medical Devices Directive as amended to reflect the UK’s post-Brexit regulatory regime. Notably, the UK Regulations do not include any of the revisions that have been made by the EU Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745, which, since May 26, 2021, now applies in all EU Member States. 
The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency conducted a comprehensive consultation between September and November 2021 on proposals to develop a new UK regime for medical devices in the UK. The proposals include more closely aligning definitions for medical devices and in vitro medical devices with internationally recognised definitions and changing the classification of medical devices according to levels or risk. The proposals are intended to improve patient and public safety and increase the appeal of the UK market. The new regime is planned to come into force on July 1, 2023, which will align with the date from which the UK is due to stop accepting CE marked medical devices and require UK Conformity Assessed marking. It is envisaged that, in Northern Ireland, the amended regime could run in parallel with any existing or future EU rules in accordance with the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Consequences of Non-Compliance
Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical holds, refusal of regulatory authorities to approve or authorize pending product applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, financial penalties and/or criminal prosecution.
Environmental Regulation
In connection with our research and development activities, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies, both internationally and domestically, governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes and employee safety and health matters. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to take any significant action to correct any noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, certain hazardous chemicals and radioactive materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with applicable law and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability not covered by insurance could exceed our resources. See the risk factor, “We may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials.” in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties we face due to the use of hazardous materials.
