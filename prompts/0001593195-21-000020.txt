Item 1. Business
Overview
Tribune Publishing Company, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “Tribune”), is a media company rooted in award-winning journalism. Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Tribune operates local media businesses in eight markets with titles including the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, The Baltimore Sun, Hartford Courant, South Florida’s Sun Sentinel, Orlando Sentinel, Virginia’s Daily Press and The Virginian-Pilot, and The Morning Call of Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania. Tribune also operates Tribune Content Agency (“TCA”). Tribune’s major daily newspapers have served their respective communities with local, regional, national and international news and information for more than 150 years. The Hartford Courant is the nation’s oldest continuously published newspaper and celebrated its 256th anniversary in October 2020.
Tribune’s unique and valuable content across its brands have earned a combined 65 Pulitzer Prizes and are committed to informing, inspiring and engaging local communities. Tribune’s brands create and distribute content across our media portfolio, offering integrated marketing, media, and business services to consumers and advertisers, including digital solutions and advertising opportunities.
The Company’s results of operations, when examined on a quarterly basis, reflect the seasonality of Tribune’s revenues. Second and fourth quarter advertising revenues are typically higher than first and third quarter revenues. Results for the second quarter reflect spring advertising revenues, while the fourth quarter includes advertising revenues related to the holiday season.
Agreement and Plan of Merger
On February 16, 2021, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Tribune Enterprises, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“TELLC”), Tribune Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of TELLC (“Merger Sub”), and the Company, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge (the “Merger”) with and into the Company, with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of TELLC. TELLC is the acquirer and is an affiliate of Alden Global Opportunities Master Fund, L.P. and Alden Global Value Recovery 
Master Fund, L.P. (collectively, “Alden”), the Company’s largest shareholder. Upon completion of the transaction the Company will become a privately held company, and its common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (other than treasury stock or common stock held by TELLC or any of its affiliates) issued and outstanding immediately as of the closing (other than dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive $17.25 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”).
The consummation of the Merger (the “Closing”) is subject to certain customary mutual conditions, including (i) the approval of the Company’s stockholders holding two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock not owned by TELLC and its affiliates, (ii) the expiration or termination of any waiting period applicable to the closing of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the “HSR Act”) and (iii) the absence of any order of any U.S. court that prohibits, renders illegal or permanently enjoins the consummation of the Merger. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the Closing (subject to customary materiality qualifiers), (ii) compliance by the other party in all material respects with its pre-Closing obligations under the Merger Agreement and (iii) in TELLC’s case, the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to the Company.
The Company and TELLC have each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company has agreed, among other things, to covenants relating to the conduct of its business during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger. The parties have also agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain governmental and regulatory approvals. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the Company has agreed to covenants relating to (i) the submission of the Merger Agreement to the Company’s stockholders at a special meeting thereof for approval, (ii) the recommendation by the board of directors of the Company in favor of the adoption by the Company’s stockholders of the Merger Agreement and (iii) non-solicitation obligations of the Company relating to alternative acquisition proposals.
Either the Company or TELLC may terminate the Merger Agreement if (i) TELLC, Merger Sub and the Company agree by mutual written consent to do so, (ii) the Merger has not been consummated on or before December 31, 2021 (the “End Date”), (iii) any court has issued an order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order or other action is, or has become, final and non-appealable, (iv) the approval of the Company’s stockholders is not obtained at a meeting of the Company’s stockholders called for the purpose of adopting the Merger Agreement or (v) the other party breaches any representation, warranty or covenant that results in the failure of the related closing condition to be satisfied, subject to a cure period in certain circumstances. In addition, the Company may, under certain circumstances, terminate the Merger Agreement in order for the Company to enter concurrently into a definitive written agreement with respect to an unsolicited superior acquisition proposal, subject to the Company having first complied with certain matching rights and other obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement. Additionally, TELLC may, under certain circumstances, terminate the Merger Agreement if (i) the board of directors of the Company changes or adversely modifies its recommendation that the Company’s stockholders vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement or (ii) the Company materially breaches its non-solicitation obligations and such breach results in an alternative transaction proposal.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company in order for the Company to enter into a definitive written agreement with respect to an unsolicited superior acquisition proposal, (ii) by TELLC because (a) the board of directors of the Company changes or adversely modifies its recommendation that the Company’s stockholders vote in favor of adopting the Merger Agreement or (b) the Company materially breaches its non-solicitation obligations and such breach results in an alternative transaction proposal, or (iii) by (x) either party because the Merger was not consummated on or before the End Date (as it may be extended) or approval of the Company’s stockholders was not obtained or (y) by TELLC if the Company commits a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant that results in the failure of the related closing condition to be satisfied (subject to a cure period in certain circumstances), but only if, in the case of this clause (iii), an alternative acquisition proposal was previously made and, within 12 months after termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company enters into an agreement for an alternative transaction or an acquisition transaction is consummated, then, in each case, the Company will be obligated to pay to TELLC a one-time fee equal to $20 million in cash.
If the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company (i) if TELLC breaches any representation, warranty or covenant that results in the failure of the related closing condition to be satisfied, subject to a cure period in certain circumstances or (ii) if the conditions to TELLC’s obligations to consummate the Merger are satisfied or waived, and TELLC does not consummate the Merger when required by the Merger Agreement, then TELLC will be obligated to pay to the Company a one-time liquidated damages amount equal to $50 million in cash.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, TELLC agreed to vote all of its shares of common stock in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, so long as the board of directors of the Company has not changed or adversely modified its recommendation in favor of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement also prohibits TELLC from transferring any of its shares of common stock, subject to certain exceptions.
Alden Global Opportunities Master Fund, L.P. and Alden Global Value Recovery Master Fund, L.P. (each, a “Guarantor”) have entered into a Limited Guarantee dated February 16, 2021 (the “Limited Guarantee”) with the Company to guarantee TELLC’s obligation to pay the liquidated damages amount to the Company and certain other specified payments to the Company, subject to the terms and obligations set forth in the Limited Guarantee.
The Guarantors have also entered into an equity commitment letter dated as of February 16, 2021 (the “Equity Commitment Letter”) with TELLC pursuant to which the Guarantors have made an equity commitment of $375 million to TELLC to fund the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration. The Company is a third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter and has the right to specifically enforce the Guarantors’ obligations thereunder, if the conditions to TELLC’s obligations to consummate the Merger are satisfied or waived, and the Merger is consummated substantially simultaneously.
Concurrent with the signing of the merger agreement, Alden has signed a non-binding term sheet to sell The Baltimore Sun to Sunlight for All Institute, a public charity formed by Stewart Bainum Jr.
COVID-19
With the global outbreak of COVID-19 and the declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, the governments in the states in which Tribune operates have deemed news publishing and media services as “critical infrastructure” providing essential services and information during this global emergency. As a provider of critical infrastructure, Tribune is not subject to business closure requirements and has taken steps to keep employees working safely and news and information being distributed. Tribune remains focused on protecting the health and well-being of its employees and the communities in which it operates while assuring the continuity of its business operations. See Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis for additional information on the Company’s response to COVID-19.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company negotiated rent relief from lessors in various forms, including lease restructuring, rent abatement, deferrals or lease terminations. During the year ended December 27, 2020, the Company permanently vacated 972,699 square feet of office, production and distribution space. The space was vacated as some of our locations have transitioned to long-term remote working arrangements and the Company outsourced printing at two of our locations. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on leases.
On May 8, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”) suspended the Company's quarterly cash dividend program until further notice given the unprecedented economic disruption caused by COVID-19.
Significant transactions and recent events

On December 11, 2020, the Company, entered into a Membership Unit Purchase Agreement (the “BR Agreement”), by and among the Company and BR Holding Company, Inc. (collectively the "Sellers"), BestReviews LLC (“BestReviews”) and Nexstar Inc. (“Nexstar”), pursuant to which the Sellers will sell 100% of BestReviews to Nexstar (the “BR Transaction”). BestReviews is a company engaged in the business of testing, researching and reviewing consumer products and generates referral fee revenue by directing online traffic from their published reviews to websites where the products can be purchased.

BestReviews is presented under discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. All prior periods have been adjusted. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the related discontinued operations.
Segments
In the first quarter of 2020, the Company realigned its operations by combining the print and digital operations of its media groups together under the leadership of the Chief Executive Officer, who is also the chief operating decision maker for Tribune, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 280. As a result of the realignment, the Company no longer reports separate segment results for its print and digital operations. The Company now manages its business as nine operating segments that are aggregated into one reportable segment, comprised of the Company’s media groups, digital revenues, third-party and affiliate websites, mobile applications, digital only subscriptions and TCA.
Revenue Sources
The Company’s three primary revenue streams are circulation, advertising and marketing services, and third-party printing and distribution. In the year ended December 27, 2020, 47.3% of the Company’s operating revenues were derived from circulation revenue. Circulation revenue results from the sale of print and digital editions of the newspapers and other owned publications to individual subscribers, the sale of print editions of newspapers to sales outlets that re-sell the newspapers, and the sale of digital subscription access to the Company’s websites.
In the year ended December 27, 2020, 35.0% of the Company’s operating revenues were derived from advertising. These revenues were generated from the sale of advertising space in published issues of the newspapers, and on interactive websites, from the delivery of preprinted advertising supplements and from marketing services. 
Newspaper print advertising is typically in the form of display, classified or preprint advertising. Advertising and marketing services revenues are comprised of three basic categories: retail, national and classified. Retail is a category of customers who tend to do business directly with the general public, National is a category of customers who tend to do business directly with other businesses. Classified is a type of advertising which is other than display or preprint.
Digital advertising can be in the form of display, banner ads, advertising widgets, coupon ads, video, search advertising and linear ads placed on Tribune and affiliated websites. Digital marketing services include development of mobile websites, search engine marketing and optimization, social media account management and content marketing for its customer’s web presence for small to medium-sized businesses.
In the year ended December 27, 2020, 17.7% of the Company’s operating revenues were derived from other revenues. Other revenues are derived from commercial printing and delivery services provided to other newspapers, direct mail advertising and services, content syndication and licensing, referral fees and other related activities. The Company contracts with a number of national and local newspapers to both print and distribute their respective publications in local markets where it is a newspaper publisher. In some instances where it prints publications, it also manages and procures newsprint, ink and plates on their behalf. These arrangements allow the Company to leverage its investment in infrastructure in those markets that support its own publications. As a result, these arrangements tend to contribute incremental profitability and revenues. The Company currently distributes national newspapers (including The New York Times, USA Today, and The Wall Street Journal) in its local markets under multiple agreements. Additionally, in New York, Chicago, and South Florida, the Company provides some or all of these services to other local publications.

Competition 
Each of the Company’s nine major daily newspapers holds a leading market position in their respective designated market areas as determined by Nielsen and competes for readership and advertising with both local or community newspapers as well as national newspapers and other traditional and web-based media sources. Increasingly, the Company is facing competition from digital platforms that have content, search, aggregation and social media functionality, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, over-the-top video services, radio, direct mail, yellow pages, outdoor, and other media as advertisers adjust their spending based on the perceived value of the audience reached and the cost to reach that audience.  Over time, less competition for advertising dollars is coming from the traditional local, regional and national newspapers.
The secular shift of how content is consumed, including the ubiquity of mobile platforms, has led to increased competition from a wide variety of new digital content offerings, many of which are often free to users. Besides price, variables impacting customer acquisition and retention include the quality and nature of the user experience and the quality of the content offered.
To address the structural shift to digital media, the Company provides editorial content on a wide variety of platforms and formats - from the printed daily newspaper to the Company’s leading local websites; on social network sites such as Facebook, Apple News and Twitter; on smartphones, tablets and e-readers; on websites and blogs; in niche online publications and in e-mail newsletters.
Raw Materials
As a publisher of newspapers, Tribune utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. During 2020, we consumed approximately 106 thousand metric tons of newsprint. Our earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices. The Company currently obtains substantially all of its newsprint under a long-term contract with a national purchasing aggregator who then draws upon U.S. and internationally based newsprint producers. We believe that our current source of paper supply is adequate. Newsprint and ink expense accounted for 4.2% of total operating expenses in the year ended December 27, 2020.
Human Capital
As of December 27, 2020, we had approximately 2,865 full-time and part-time employees, including approximately 1,143 employees represented by various employee unions. Of our full-time employees, we have 896 editorial staff including journalists, 369 advertising staff and 1,270 printing and production staff. These numbers reflect a 30.4% decrease in total headcount as a result of the Company’s strategy to flatten its management organization. Additionally, there was a decrease of 36.8% in printing and production staff primarily associated with the outsourcing of the printing and packaging at The Virginian-Pilot and the Hartford Courant.
During 2020, the Company implemented strategic pillars around our employees to attract and retain top talent and drive our business through supporting the success of our employees. Initiatives were implemented to increase employee engagement, encourage open communication with employees, support employee learning and development and focus on employee diversity and inclusion.
To increase employee engagement and retention, the Company has implemented recognition programs, team building and appreciation programs and a brand ambassador program. The Company has committed to open communication with employees, including informal business updates and quarterly town hall meetings. To support employee learning and development, the Company has rolled out additional learning support with an emphasis on leadership in a diverse and inclusive environment, coaching for success, a new manager playbook and managing in today’s remote and virtual work team environment. The Company increased its commitment to diversity and inclusion initiatives throughout 2020. In addition to the leadership training noted above, the Company aims to achieve its diversity and inclusion goals through initiatives including: 
•publishing an enhanced newsletter that focuses on diversity and highlights diverse employees throughout the organization; 
•setting goals with an emphasis on increasing diverse representation in management roles; 
•holding panel discussions on relevant topics throughout the year; 
•supporting our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), including new ERG development; 
•providing industry-leading training for our newsrooms to promote accurate and equitable reporting on the diverse communities we serve; 
•providing a discussion guide for managers to promote a continued dialogue on these topics;
•revising our diverse talent acquisition strategy; and 
•establishing a steering committee that oversees this important work.
Intellectual Property
Currently, our operations are generally not reliant on patents owned by third parties. However, because we operate a large number of websites and mobile applications in high-visibility markets, we do defend patent litigation, from time to time, brought primarily by non-practicing entities, as opposed to marketplace competitors. We have sought patent protection in certain instances; however, we do not consider patents to be material to our business as a whole. Of greater importance to our overall business are the federal, international and state trademark registrations and applications that protect, along with our common law rights, our brands, certain of which are long-standing and well known, such as Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News and Hartford Courant. Generally, the duration of a trademark registration is perpetual if it is renewed on a timely basis and continues to be used properly as a trademark. We also own a large number of copyrights, none of which individually is material to the business. We maintain certain licensing and content sharing relationships with third-party content providers that allow us to produce the particular content mix we provide to our customers in our markets. The Company entered into a number of agreements with Tribune Media Company, formerly Tribune Company, or its subsidiaries (collectively, “TCO”) that provide for licenses to certain intellectual property, and in particular, we entered into a license agreement with TCO that provides a non-exclusive, royalty-free license for us to use certain trademarks, service marks and trade names, including the Tribune name. Other than the foregoing and commercially available software licenses, we do not believe that any of our licenses to third-party intellectual property are material to our business as a whole.
