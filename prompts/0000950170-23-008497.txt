 Item 1. Business.
 Introduction
 We are a Delaware corporation formerly known as GigCapital, Inc., and as a result of our business combination with Kaleyra S.p.A. on November 25, 2019, we changed our name to Kaleyra, Inc. (which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our “Business Combination”).
Business Overview
 Our Vision
 Kaleyra provides mobile communications services to financial institutions, e-commerce players, OTTs, software companies, logistic enablers, healthcare providers, retailers, and other large organizations worldwide. Through its proprietary cloud communications platforms (collectively, the “Platforms”), Kaleyra manages multi-channel integrated communications services on a global scale, consisting of inbound/outbound messaging solutions, programmable voice and Interactive Voice Response (IVR) configurations, hosted telephone numbers, conversational marketing solutions, Rich Communication Services (RCS), and other types of IP communication services such as e-mail, push notifications, video/audio/chat, and WhatsApp®. The demand for cloud communications is increasingly driven by the growing, and often mandated, need for enterprises to undertake a digital transformation that includes omnichannel, mobile-first and interactive customer communications. Mobile network operators and OTTs typically are the gateway to reach end-users’ mobile devices. Kaleyra enables its customers and business partners to connect enterprise software and applications to mobile network operators by providing carefully documented Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”). APIs allow building omnichannel journeys in a seamless way, with failover capabilities from one channel to another. In addition, Kaleyra also offers an extensive set of no-coding cloud-based visual interfaces to program communications to the customers across multiple channels. Kaleyra’s Platforms couple the possibility of sending communications to end-users to a “Software as a Service” or SaaS business model, creating what is generally referred to as a “Communications Platform as a Service”, or simply CPaaS.
 Kaleyra’s vision is to be the CPaaS provider that best aligns with its customers’ and business partners’ communication requirements and outcomes, and the most trusted provider in the world. This requires a combination of security, compliance and integration capabilities that protects the integrity and privacy of Kaleyra’s customers’ transactions and includes other key features such as ease of provisioning, reliable network connectivity, high availability for scaling, redundancy, embedded regulatory compliance, configurable monitoring, analytics, and reporting. Kaleyra believes the percentage of CPaaS customers that will require security, compliance and integrations will represent an increasingly larger portion of the market, particularly with the expected exponential growth of transactional-by-nature cloud communications applications, better enabling Kaleyra to set itself apart from its competition.
 Kaleyra Today
 Kaleyra is a result of the expansion of the former Ubiquity, which was founded in Milan, Italy in 1999. Ubiquity secured a leading market position in mobile messaging on behalf of the Italian financial services industry and then expanded its products and geographic offerings. Ubiquity acquired Solutions Infini of Bangalore, India in 2017 and Buc Mobile of Vienna, Virginia in 2018. Kaleyra was rebranded as Kaleyra S.p.A. in February 2018. Following the integration of the acquired entities, the combined company is collectively engaged in the operation of the Platforms on behalf of Kaleyra’s customers.
 On February 22, 2019, the Company (f/k/a GigCapital, Inc.) entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) by and among the Company, Kaleyra S.p.A., Shareholder Representative Services LLC, as representative for the holders of the ordinary shares of Kaleyra S.p.A. immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, and all of the stockholders of all of the Kaleyra S.p.A. stock (collectively, such Kaleyra S.p.A. stockholders, the “Sellers”), for the purpose of the Company acquiring all of the shares of Kaleyra S.p.A.. GigCapital Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on October 9, 2017 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital

stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
 As a result of the Business Combination, which closed on November 25, 2019, the Company (headquartered in Milan, Italy) became a multi-channel integrated communications services provider on a global scale. At the time of the closing of the Business Combination, Kaleyra operated in the CPaaS market with operations primarily in Italy, India, Dubai and the United States. In connection with the closing, the Company changed its name from GigCapital, Inc. to Kaleyra, Inc..
 On October 22, 2019, Kaleyra’s U.S. subsidiary, The Campaign Registry Inc. (“TCR”), was incorporated under the laws of Delaware to promote a systems initiative to reduce spam by collecting robotically driven campaign information and processing and sharing that information with mobile operators and the messaging ecosystem. TCR started to account for its first revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2020 and revenue has constantly increased since then. On March 26, 2021, a wholly owned subsidiary of TCR was incorporated under the laws of Canada, with the registered office in Vancouver, British Columbia. This new subsidiary was established with the goal to further expand the registry legacy business in North America.
 On July 29, 2020, Kaleyra registered a German branch of Kaleyra S.p.A. with the German Chamber Tax Authority of Commerce. Kaleyra established its branch in Germany to expand Kaleyra’s footprint in Central Europe and the Nordic countries and allow it to leverage Kaleyra’s trusted business solutions for customers in additional jurisdictions.
 On February 18, 2021, Kaleyra entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Vivial, Inc. (“Vivial”) for the acquisition of the business known as mGage (“mGage”), a leading global mobile messaging provider in the United States (the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Merger”).
 On June 1, 2021, Kaleyra completed its acquisition of mGage for a total purchase price of $218.0 million. The Merger consideration consisted of both cash consideration and common stock consideration. On August 30, 2021, the Company prepared and delivered to the Stockholder Representative a written statement (the “Post-Closing Statement”) setting forth the calculation of closing cash and closing net working capital which ultimately resulted in the final Merger consideration to be equal to $217.0 million pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The cash consideration amounted to $199.2 million of which $198.6 million was paid on June 1, 2021 and the remaining amount was settled during the period ended September 30, 2021, including a working capital adjustment of $997,000. The common stock consideration was paid with the issuance to Vivial’s former equity holders of a total of 457,143 shares of Kaleyra common stock at the $41.20 per share closing price (on a post-reverse split basis) of Kaleyra common stock on the date of issuance, equal to $18.8 million. In support of the consummation of the Merger, on February 18, 2021, Kaleyra entered into subscription agreements (the “PIPE Subscription Agreements”), with certain institutional investors (the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which, among other things, Kaleyra agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, an aggregate of 2,400,000 shares of Kaleyra common stock to the PIPE Investors at $43.75 per share (on a post-reverse split basis). Kaleyra also entered into convertible note subscription agreements (the “Convertible Note Subscription Agreements”) with certain institutional investors (the “Convertible Note Investors”), pursuant to which Kaleyra agreed to issue and sell, in private placements to close immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, $200 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes (the “Merger Convertible Notes”).
 On July 1, 2021, Kaleyra completed a company reorganization of the acquired business of mGage through the initial dissolution of the Delaware single member LLCs of Vivial Holdings, LLC, Vivial Networks, LLC, and the following merger of mGage, LLC into the surviving holding company, Vivial Inc., which subsequently changed its name into Kaleyra US Inc., as a result of the reorganization. As a result of the merger, Kaleyra US Inc. became the holding company and one hundred percent (100%) owner of Kaleyra UK Limited – previously known as mGage Europe Ltd. (UK) and mGage SA de SV (Mexico).
 On July 8, 2021, Kaleyra completed the acquisition of Bandyer S.r.l. (“Bandyer”) for cash consideration of $15.4 million. Bandyer offers cloud-based audio/video communications services via Web Real Time Communication (“WebRTC”) technology to financial institutions, retail companies, utilities, industries, insurance companies, human resources, and digital healthcare organizations. Bandyer provides customers with programmable audio/video APIs and Software Development Kits (“SDKs”) based on WebRTC technology for a variety of use cases, including Augmented Reality (“AR”) applications for smart glasses. On January 13, 2022, Kaleyra completed a company reorganization of the acquired business of Bandyer by means of the merger of the Italian legal entity of

Bandyer into the holding company, Kaleyra S.p.A.. As a result of the merger, Bandyer ceased to exist as a separate legal entity and all its assets and liabilities have been incorporated under Kaleyra S.p.A. effective January 13, 2022.
 Effective August 31, 2021, the common stock of the Company ceased trading on the NYSE American stock exchange and commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “KLR.” Kaleyra’s warrants continue to trade on the NYSE American under the symbol “KLR WS”.
 On October 11, 2021, Kaleyra Africa Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kaleyra Inc., was incorporated under the law of South Africa with the registered office in Waterfall City, Gauteng. This subsidiary was established as part of Kaleyra's broader strategic plan of expanding into emerging markets whereby South Africa will serve as Kaleyra's hub to enter the entire African market.
 On November 15, 2021, pursuant to the provisions of the Merger Agreement, Kaleyra Dominicana, S.R.L., ninety-nine percent (99%) direct ownership of Kaleyra US Inc. and one percent (1%) direct ownership of Kaleyra Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the Dominican Republic with the registered office in Santo Domingo. This subsidiary was established to provide the Kaleyra group with back-office technology support and engage in product development and innovation.
 Kaleyra has customers and business partners worldwide across industry verticals such as financial services, e-commerce and transportation. Kaleyra’s customers are located in regions throughout the world including Europe, Asia Pacific, North and South America. Kaleyra’s revenue by country for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: U.S. (38.9%), India (20.7%), Italy (19.6%) and South America (3.8%). The remainder of the revenue is primarily generated in Europe and Asia in countries other than Italy and India (17.0%).
 For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, 97% of revenues came from customers of Kaleyra which have been on the Platforms for at least one year. Although Kaleyra continues to expand by introducing new customers to the Platforms, the breadth and stability of its existing customers provide it with a solid base of revenue upon which it can continue to innovate and make investments. In continuity with the past, Kaleyra is committed to strengthen its product portfolio, expand its global presence, recruit world-class talent and develop synergies with external players to capitalize on its growing market penetration opportunities and value creation.
 Customers
 Kaleyra’s customers are primarily global enterprises which use digital mobile communications in the conduct of their business. Kaleyra provides multiple levels of global customer support 24x7, SLAs and network reliability to meet the expectations and requirements of its customers. Customers and business partners which use the Platforms value the Platforms’ network reliability, and Kaleyra’s responsive customer support and competitive pricing. In particular, Kaleyra was listed by Gartner (Gartner, Market Guide for Communications Platform as a Service, Worldwide, Daniel O’Connell, Lisa Under-Farboud, October 2022) as a co-creator, in other words, a CPaaS focused on a consultative business model that emphasizes consulting services, solves business problems and often pursues specific verticals. Kaleyra also partners with consulting companies and digital transformation players worldwide to go-to-market together. Also, Kaleyra was given the Gold award for “CPaaS Provider of the Year” by Juniper Research in February 2022, and was ranked as an Established Leader at the forefront of the global CPaaS market by Juniper Research, an independent analyst house, in its latest Competitor Leaderboard (2022).
 Kaleyra services a broad base of customers and business partners throughout the world operating in diverse sectors and regions. Kaleyra’s key customers are large Business to Consumer (“B2C”) and Business to Business to Consumer (“B2B2C”) enterprises that use digital and mobile communications in the conduct of their business. Kaleyra has a concentration of business within the financial services industry that serves its major European banking end-users. With each relationship, Kaleyra is the link between the financial institutions and their end-users. In linking these two parties, Kaleyra’s Platforms leverage the telecommunications provider to transmit message data to these end-users.
 For example, banks and financial institutions deploy Kaleyra’s services that include omnichannel mobile-first password reset, account access, two-factor authentications (“2FA”), transaction notifications, anti-fraud alerts, among other services, via a cloud implementation that meets their strict requirements for security and compliance. Kaleyra’s Platforms have facilitated compliant communications for its existing financial institution customer base in Europe. European Central Bank (“ECB”) regulations have begun to mandate additional customer protection regulations, such as those requiring strong customer authentications for all payment transactions over €30,

facilitating the digital transformation of both traditional banks and new entrants. In the financial sector, security and compliance are generally top of mind and the sales process relies on a dedicated local sales team focused on strong integration capabilities with the full suite of services needed to satisfy customer requirements.
 Other enterprise customers of Kaleyra use Kaleyra’s cloud communications services as packaged offerings that are easy to configure and manage around key end-user touchpoints. Although these enterprise customers require a lesser level of system integration than financial institution customers do, they still demand a sufficiently flexible system such as that which a cloud solution can provide to facilitate rapid communications system modification to accommodate changes in end-user behaviors. Furthermore, there are other enterprise customers for which connectivity to their end-users is their primary requirement, and these customers are using the Platforms to gain access to mobile network operators worldwide. This additional volume, which is expected to continue to grow as the transformation from e-mail-based communications to messaging-based communications is being enhanced, allows Kaleyra to leverage relationships to sell and resell network connectivity on a more cost-effective basis.
 In 2022 and 2021, there was no customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of Kaleyra’s consolidated total revenues.
 Seasonality
 Historically, Kaleyra has experienced clear seasonality in its revenue generation, with slower traction in the first calendar quarter, and increasing revenues as the year progresses. Kaleyra typically experiences higher revenues in messaging and notification services during the fourth calendar quarter. This patterned revenue generation behavior takes place due to Kaleyra’s customers sending more messages to their end-users who are engaged in consumer transactions at the end of the calendar year, resulting in an increase in notifications of electronic payments, credit card transactions and e-commerce.
The Market for Kaleyra’s Products
 The CPaaS market is evolving and is expanding in several directions as enterprise adoption of cloud-based communications occurs. The need for enterprises to provide enhanced omnichannel end-user experiences is driving adoption by enterprises of embedded, real-time interactive communications for enhanced end-user-interfacing interactions. Juniper Research anticipates that CPaaS revenue will reach $32 billion by 2026, rising from $10.2 billion in 2022. Juniper Research also anticipates that SMS will remain the most widely used channel for A2P messaging over the next five years. Despite the rise of rich media messaging and the popularity of OTT messaging applications, the ability to contact both smartphone users and featurephone users, combined with the channel’s impressive open rate, will ensure that brands and enterprises will continue to use A2P SMS messaging. CPaaS revenue from SMS business messaging traffic is expected to reach $24.3 billion globally, rising from $9.4 billion in 2022 (Juniper Research, CPAAS Data & Forecasting 2021-2026, published in September 2021). Juniper Research forecasts that global mobile messaging revenue will increase from $182.5 billion in 2022 to $193.4 billion in 2025. (Juniper Research, Mobile Messaging 2021-2025 Data & Forecasting, published in June 2021).
Kaleyra’s Key Products
 The Platforms
 Kaleyra operates its core technology, the Platforms, in the public cloud, as private clouds, and in hybrid situations. The Platforms have a high-volume infrastructure that has been designed to easily scale and support large volumes of data. The Platforms consist of two separate types of interfaces; one for connectivity to mobile network operators and the other, a set of APIs that provide convenient and user-friendly tools that enable Kaleyra’s customers to engage in communications with their end-users. The Platforms’ underlying software code base contains communication protocols that allow connectivity with mobile network operators around the globe.
 In addition, the Platforms’ APIs, which sit on top of the underlying connectivity stack, enable the creation of specific applications (including messaging or voice-over-IP calls) or workflows (e.g. 2FA or password resets). These applications can be designed by Kaleyra, Kaleyra’s customers’ information technologies personnel, business users, and/or third-party developers. The Platforms’ open architecture enables Kaleyra’s customers and business partners to accomplish all of their communication needs from one simple interface that connects into a broad range of systems. The relationship with Kaleyra’s customers is strengthened by providing customers with a broad and

flexible platform. Retention of Kaleyra’s customers is also enhanced as a result of the switching costs that Kaleyra’s customers would incur to transition to alternate platforms.
 Communications Services
 The following graphic summarizes the capabilities of Kaleyra’s suite of communications services:
 

This suite of services is further described below. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Kaleyra processed nearly 52 billion billable SMS messages and 8 billion voice calls on behalf of Kaleyra’s customers.
Channels Messaging, RBM/RCS, Instant Messaging
 The Platforms’ APIs include software and infrastructure that process and manage SMS, Multimedia Messaging Service (“MMS”) and Rich Communications Service (“RCS”) through Google’s technology called Rich Business Messaging (“RBM”), with network connectivity to mobile network operators around the world. The Platforms are currently designed to process five thousand messages per second, with the capability to increase the throughput with additional server power and speed. The Platforms support 87 languages and are capable of stitching together concatenated messages of up to 4,000 characters. The Platforms are also designed to manage automated opt-in and opt-out procedures per mobile network operator requirements and best practices.
 Kaleyra’s offering includes instant messaging such as WhatsApp® for Business by Meta, offering its customers the possibility to interact with their end-users for customer care and transactional communications. Communications can be handled by human agents, using Kaleyra’s conversational interface, or by automated AI-powered chatbots using NLP/NLU and integrating with the third-party systems in use by the customers.
 Channels - Voice
 The Platforms’ APIs include software and infrastructure that process and manage voice calls, including IVR and conferencing bridge capabilities. The Platforms offer features such as call masking, visual configurations of call routing, and click-to-call features.
Channels - WebRTC
 Kaleyra offers audio and video calling service to customers in multiple sectors, for use cases such as customer service, remote wealth management, telemedicine, remote field assistance and virtual meetings.


Channels - Email and push notifications
 The offering of channels by Kaleyra is completed by e-mail and push notification, which provide inexpensive and commonly used means of communications with customers, often chosen by brands as an alternative to or fallback from other channels.
 Tools
 Kaleyra distinguishes itself in the market by providing a complete set of visual tools for non-coders, that make it possible for business users to program communications across multiple channels without any developers’ help. Users can setup campaigns, configure virtual phone numbers, perform lookups on mobile numbers, and create communications templates by using Kaleyra’s tools.
Solutions
 Kaleyra works as a Co-Creator (as defined by Gartner, 2022) alongside the customers’ marketing, business, Customer Experience (“CX”) experts and developers, to co-design and invent solutions dedicated to specific industries and business problems. Along with this, Kaleyra also offers for all its products an extensive set of integrations to the most widely used CRM and marketing automation systems, including, but not limited to, Oracle products and the Salesforce platform. Those integrations, sometimes available on request and often published on third-party marketplaces, enable a wider series of use cases for brands.
Operations
 Kaleyra generates revenue primarily from usage-based fees earned from the sale of communications services utilizing the Platforms. These services are offered through access to the Platforms to customers and business partners across enterprises. Revenue can be billed in advance or in arrears depending on the terms of the agreement; for the majority of customers, revenue is invoiced on a monthly basis in arrears.
 Kaleyra’s CPaaS contracts do not provide customers and business partners with the right to take possession of the software supporting the applications.
 As a part of the arrangement with its customers, Kaleyra also offers customer advanced support services, to guarantee continuity and prompt delivery of the services. Revenue for these services is recognized ratably over the term of the service period.
 Kaleyra utilizes a cloud infrastructure and its Platforms to deliver its communications services. The services are also provided using a private cloud as required by the customers and business partners. The cost of the Platforms and communications services purchased from mobile network operators is considered to be a cost of revenue.
 Products in Development
 Kaleyra constantly works on improving performance, scalability, and security for its customers, alongside working on a pipeline for new product offerings, tools and solutions. As an example, in 2022 Kaleyra developed the failover/fallback feature, a new API and interface-based tool allowing users to set up communication flows with automatic fallback from one channel to another in case of failures of the primary channels. This allows business users and developers to make sure communications reach the end user, from a single centralized point of control, in an easy way, and implement omnichannel strategies. Kaleyra has a team of software developers in the USA, and in Bangalore, India engaged in research and development of additional product features based on continuous customer feedback, as well as primary and secondary market research. Kaleyra is committed to developing synergies with other companies and business partners that can enhance its product portfolio.
Research and Development
 As of December 31, 2022, Kaleyra employs 325 employees engaged in research and development and engineering, representing about 48% of its workforce. The R&D and engineering teams are focused on maintaining and enhancing the Platforms and communications service offerings, as well as developing new communications services and engaging with Kaleyra’s customers in this development.
Sales and Marketing
 Kaleyra has multiple methods for engaging with its customers, depending upon the specific service offerings that a customer uses on the Platforms. 20% of Kaleyra’s employee base is dedicated to sales of communications services to Kaleyra’s customers or business partners. The go-to-market strategy utilizes a mixture of direct sales, and channel development, such as engaging third-party developers and system integrators that develop communications solutions for multiple customers. Kaleyra also actively participates globally in trade shows and industry and academic meetings for lead generation and building of brand awareness.
Competitive Strengths
 Over Kaleyra’s vicennial history, the Company has developed a powerful CPaaS solution that has a solid and distinguishable positioning as “the trusted CPaaS” across large enterprises, with an acknowledged footprint on the financial sector and meaningful examples of long-tenure customers . The Platforms are accessible everywhere in the world, have a high-volume infrastructure that is designed for scalability, and allow for communications services that have been designed having security, compliance and integration capabilities in mind, in order to meet the needs of Kaleyra’s customers, their customers, and regulators. Furthermore, Kaleyra continues to organically and strategically develop new communications services to meet the evolving needs of its customers and business partners. In addition, Kaleyra has identified the following competitive strengths:
Experienced Management Team
 Kaleyra has a proven management team with many decades of combined international experience at industry-relevant companies.
 Existing Customers and Relationships
 Kaleyra believes its deep customer relationships provide it with the opportunity to expand deployment of the Platforms and the opportunity to quickly deploy new communications service offerings.
Growth Strategy
 Kaleyra’s organic growth focuses on four core areas:
 •Exploiting cross-sale opportunities among Kaleyra’s products, the Company focuses on growing omnichannel use cases, while accelerating partnerships and integrations with industry-leading software vendors;
 •Product evolution — Kaleyra works to improve its offering in alignment with trends in the market and customers' demand; 
 •Geographic expansion — Kaleyra focuses on entering new markets and growing in high-potential, underserved areas and segments; and
 •Leveraging larger technology ecosystems — Being part of larger technology ecosystems such as the marketplaces provided by the most well-known CRM and marketing automation platforms; and partnering with primary system integrators to be able to deliver full-fledged services to customers.
 Inorganic growth:
 Mergers and acquisitions such as the acquisitions of Solutions Infini, Buc Mobile, mGage and Bandyer have added significant value from the market, technology and product perspectives to the growth of Kaleyra. Kaleyra will continue to search for synergies and value creation opportunities through partnerships with players in the CPaaS and other adjacent markets.
 Competition
 The CPaaS market is highly competitive and characterized by continuous technological change. The principal competitive factors in this market include completeness of offering, credibility with customers and business partners, global reach, ease of integration, product features, quality of connections, platform scalability, brand

reputation and awareness, customer support, and the cost of deployment of product offerings. Kaleyra believes that it competes favorably within each of these categories.
 Kaleyra competes with several vendors across its various product lines, including:
 •Legacy on-premises vendors, such as Avaya Holdings Corp., Cisco Systems, Inc., (through its acquisition of IMIMobile) and SAP SE;
 •Direct competitors, such as CLX Communications AB (d/b/a Sinch), Infobip ltd, Twilio Inc., Route Mobile, Tanla Platform Limited, and Vonage Holdings Corp. (as of November 22, 2021, Ericsson (Nasdaq:ERIC) through its acquisition of Vonage;
 •Smaller software companies, sometimes working locally, that compete with certain portions of Kaleyra’s communications services offerings; and
 •SaaS companies that offer prepackaged applications for a narrower set of use cases than Kaleyra.
 Some competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name and brand recognition, larger sales and marketing efforts and larger portfolios of intellectual property. As a result, certain competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing technologies, opportunities, standards or customer needs and requests. With the introduction of new products and services and new market entrants, Kaleyra expects competition to intensify in the future. Furthermore, as Kaleyra continues to expand the scope of its Platforms, it may face additional competition. Kaleyra is also addressing enterprises that have developed over the years “in-house” products for which Kaleyra can offer a more cost-effective, robust and richer set of products to enhance the total cost of ownership and return on investment for such customers.
 Human Capital
 Kaleyra’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop diverse talent to deliver on the Company’s strategy. Kaleyra understands the value of the people associated with the Company and strives to provide an environment that promotes innovation on the global scale.
 As of December 31, 2022, Kaleyra has 675 employees, of which 325 were in research and development, 132 were in sales, marketing and business development and 218 were in general and administrative. The group headcount is spread across the globe including 297 employees in Asia Pacific, 190 employees located in North and South America, 183 employees in Europe and 5 employees in other locations across the globe.
 None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. Employees in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have the benefits of collective bargaining agreements at the national level. Relations with Kaleyra’s employees are considered good and no interruptions of operations or work stoppages due to labor disagreements have been experienced.
 Facilities
 Kaleyra leases 19 properties, with its headquarters in Milan, Italy. Kaleyra maintains a global footprint with additional leased facilities located in Atlanta, Georgia; Bengaluru, India; Chennai, India; Delhi, India; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Kochi, India; Kolkata, India; London, United Kingdom; Mumbai, India; Munich, Germany; New York, New York; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and Vienna, Virginia. Kaleyra believes that its current facilities are adequate to meet its ongoing needs and that, if it requires adjusted or additional space, it will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms, or further consolidate facilities. Going forward, Kaleyra will continue to assess its facilities requirements and make appropriate adjustments as needed and dictated by the business.
 Kaleyra operates 42 data centers, including cloud platforms operated by Amazon Web Services, and Kaleyra maintains private clouds on behalf of its customers. The Kaleyra private cloud devices are custom-built hardware running the Kaleyra’s Platforms and, thus, can be deployed virtually anywhere. Kaleyra currently runs these private cloud devices out of its headquarters in Milan, Italy.


Intellectual Property
 Kaleyra relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect Kaleyra’s proprietary technology. In addition, Kaleyra protects intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires its employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on its behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on its behalf are Kaleyra’s property, and assigning to Kaleyra any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.
 •Kaleyra, as of December 31, 2022, has been issued patents in the U.S. which are protected for durations ranging from 2028 to 2034.
 •Kaleyra’s trademark and certain variations thereof are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications in the U.S. In addition to the Kaleyra trademark, Kaleyra has 18 additional trademark registrations or pending registrations in three different classes with the following authorities/countries: EU, India, South Africa, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, and the International Bureau (WIPO) China, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore.
 •Kaleyra owns an Internet domain registration for kaleyra.com and certain other domains.
 •Kaleyra generally controls access and the use of its proprietary software and other confidential information through internal and external controls including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners. Unauthorized parties may, nonetheless, still copy or otherwise obtain and use Kaleyra’s software and technology despite Kaleyra’s efforts to protect its trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements.
 Regulatory
 Kaleyra is subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to its business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, export taxation, general telecommunications laws or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which Kaleyra is subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm its business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which Kaleyra operates. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that it or its communications services or the Platforms may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.
 In addition, as Kaleyra expands internationally, it will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which it offers services. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the EU member states, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information (“PII”) obtained from individuals located in the EU or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction, which are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of PII that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, telephone numbers, message addresses and, in some jurisdictions, IP addresses and other online identifiers.
 For example, in April 2016 the EU adopted General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which took full effect on May 25, 2018. GDPR enhances data protection obligations for businesses and requires service providers (data processors) processing personal data on behalf of customers to cooperate with European data protection authorities, implement security measures and keep records of personal data processing activities. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger fines equal to or greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual revenues. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, preparing to meet the requirements of GDPR has required significant time and resources, including a review of Kaleyra’s technology and systems currently in use against the requirements of GDPR. Kaleyra has furthermore appointed an external global Data Protection Officer to further assure and maintain its compliance with the GDPR, where applicable. There are also additional EU laws and regulations (and member states’ implementations thereof) which govern the protection of consumers and of electronic communications.


Furthermore, outside of the EU, Kaleyra continues to see increased regulation of data privacy and security, including the adoption of more stringent subject matter specific state laws in the U.S. For example, on June 28, 2018, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt-out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA was later amended and integrated by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) which took effect on December 16, 2020 and, among other provisions, established the California Privacy Protection Agency. CPRA will be enforced starting July 1, 2023 and such enforcement will only apply to violations occurring on or after that date.
 Kaleyra is subject to individual or joint jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general as well as the Italian Data Protection Authority (“DPA”) (as the relevant EU National DPA) with respect to privacy and data security obligations. If Kaleyra was to suffer or if one of Kaleyra’s customers were to suffer a breach, Kaleyra may be subject to the jurisdiction of a variety of federal agencies’ jurisdictions, state attorneys general as well as of the Italian DPA. Kaleyra may have to comply with a variety of data breach laws at the federal, state and EU levels, comply with any resulting investigations, as well as offer mitigation to customers and potential end-users of certain customers to which Kaleyra provides services. Kaleyra could also be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties that may adversely impact Kaleyra’s business.
 As Kaleyra continues to expand internationally, Kaleyra has become subject to telecommunications laws and regulations in the foreign countries where Kaleyra offers its products. Kaleyra’s international operations are subject to country-specific governmental regulation or country-specific rules imposed by local carriers with whom Kaleyra has a direct contractual relationship, or indirect relationship through a local partner company. These laws and regulations may increase and as a result, may increase Kaleyra’s costs, impact its products and Platforms, or prevent the Company from offering or providing its products in certain countries.
 For example, in India, Kaleyra is subject to the Department of Telecommunication (“DoT”) regulation, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (“TRAI”) regulations, and the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference regulations, 2018, and holds an audiotex license and telemarketer registration. Apart from these regulations, Kaleyra is also subject to the Information Technology Act, 2000, and associated rules that govern the aspects of acceptable content of communications, data protection and privacy, cross-border transfers, etc..
 In the UAE, Kaleyra is specifically subject to the Federal Telecommunications Law (Federal Law by Decree No. 3 of 2003), Regulatory Policy for Unsolicited Electronic Communications (Adopted by Decision No. 37 of 2009), and The Personal Data Protection Law, Federal Decree Law No. 45 of 2021.
 In Italy, Kaleyra holds a license to be a fixed-line operator and is subject to the Electronic Communications Code, or the ECC, which has been enacted with Legislative Decree no. 259/2003, as amended, which transposed a package of European Directives adopted in 2002 and amended in 2009; the National Numbering Plan, issued with AGCom’s resolution no. 8/15/CIR as amended, which governs the usage of national numbers for the provision of electronic communications services as a whole; resolutions on the use of alphanumeric indications for the identification of the calling subject in SMS (so-called Alias), that are periodically issued by AGCom, starting from AGCom’s resolution no. 42/13/CIR; and the GDPR (EU Regulation 2016/679) as well as the Italian Privacy Code (Legislative Decree no. 196/2003 as amended, following the applicability of the GDPR, by the Legislative Decree no. 101/2018).
 In addition, in the United States, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) restricts telemarketing and the use of automatic text messages without proper consent. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If Kaleyra does not comply with these laws, or regulations or if Kaleyra becomes liable under these laws or regulations due to the failure of its customers to comply with these laws by obtaining proper consent, Kaleyra could face direct liability.
 The Federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (“CAN-SPAM Act”) establishes certain requirements for commercial messages and transactional messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. Among other things, the CAN-SPAM Act, obligates the sender of commercial messages to provide recipients with the ability to “opt-out” of receiving future commercial communications from the sender. In addition, some states have passed laws regulating commercial communication practices that are significantly more restrictive and difficult to comply

with than the CAN-SPAM Act. For example, Utah and Michigan prohibit the sending of communication messages that advertise products or services that minors are prohibited by law from purchasing (e.g., alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, illegal drugs) or that contain content harmful to minors (e.g., pornography) to message addresses listed on specified child protection registries. Some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act. In addition, certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, such as Australia, Canada, and the EU, have enacted laws that regulate sending messages, and some of these laws are more restrictive than U.S. laws. For example, some foreign laws prohibit sending broad categories of messages unless the recipient has provided the sender advance consent to receipt of such messages, or in other words has “opted-in” to receiving such communication. If Kaleyra were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, applicable state laws governing messages not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act or foreign laws regulating the distribution of messages, whether as a result of violations by Kaleyra’s customers or its own acts or omissions, Kaleyra could be required to pay large penalties, which would adversely affect its financial condition, significantly harm Kaleyra’s business, injure Kaleyra’s reputation and erode customer trust. The terms of any injunctions, judgments, consent decrees or settlement agreements entered into in connection with enforcement actions or investigations against Kaleyra in connection with any of the foregoing laws may also require Kaleyra to change one or more aspects of the way Kaleyra operates its business, which could impair Kaleyra’s ability to attract and retain customers or could increase its operating costs.
 In addition, in order to provide services to consumer telephone numbers from the EU or certain other regions, Kaleyra may be required to register with the local telecommunications regulatory authorities, some of which have been increasingly monitoring and regulating the categories of sender identity and numbers that are eligible for provisioning services to end-users on behalf of Kaleyra’s customers. Kaleyra has registered and is in the process of registering in various countries in which Kaleyra does business, but in some countries, the regulatory regime around provisioning of services to consumer telephone numbers is unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Furthermore, these regulations and governments’ approach to their enforcement, as well as Kaleyra’s products and services, are still evolving and Kaleyra may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, or enforce compliance by Kaleyra’s customers, on a timely basis or without significant cost. Also, compliance with these types of regulation may require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue.
 Additionally, certain of Kaleyra’s products and services may be subject to export control and economic sanctions regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration regulations, U.S. Customs regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of Kaleyra’s products and the provision of Kaleyra’s services must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations.
