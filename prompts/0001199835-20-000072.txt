ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
COMPANY HISTORY
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 2, 2001 under the name Altus Explorations Inc. (Altus) as a company engaged in the acquisition and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. The company has not been able to secure sufficient financing to act on oil and gas investment opportunities as they were identified. Therefore, we did very little business and showed very limited activity, with no profitability. In September 2010 we chose to enter the expanding field of training of peace and law enforcement officers as well as other professionals involved in the fields of security and safety oriented civilian training at both the individual and corporate levels. and entered into an agreement, in principle, to purchase Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc. from UWD Unitas World Development Inc. (UNITAS), a private Canadian company. We refer to this asset purchase transaction as the Acquisition. On October 1, 2010, Altus entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Agreement) with Unitas. Pursuant to the Agreement, Altus issued 80,000,000 shares of common stock for the acquisition of 450 shares of common stock of The Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc., representing 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, which were held by UWD. On November 4, 2010, Altus changed its name to Canadian Tactical Training Academy Inc. (CTTA) (the Company subsequently changed its name to Earth Life Sciences Inc. on June 2, 2014) and increased the authorized share capital from 40,000,000 to 250,000,000 shares of common stock and then further from 250,000,000 to 450,000,000. On December 4, 2018 the authorized share capital was increased 500,000,000 common shares.

The Company contemplated the production of cannabis plants in various locations. Meetings were held with knowledgeable practitioners in Denver, CO, the Okanagan and Montreal, PQ on several occasions.
 
There are numerous business issues in the contemplation of an entry into the marijuana marketplace:
 

Recreational marijuana legalization 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Personal recreational use 
Medical marijuana uses and legalization 
Marijuana decriminalization 
Marijuana businesses may not be able to secure bank accounts or transfer funds 
Cultivation licenses 
Federal vs. State laws and or Provincial 
State marijuana laws and rules are not uniform from state to state and they can and do change constantly 

 As well there are severe legal and disclosure issues:
 

Marijuana is federally illegal 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investors risk criminal liability and the cannabis businesss assets are subject to forfeiture 
IRC 280E – cannabis companies are unable to deduct expenses 

 The Company is considering the various aspects of the marijuana business and will not enter this space until satisfactory answers are in hand. Although there appears to be several companies entering the marijuana space, and investors seem to have an appetite, the Company is being careful and has not entered into any agreements or contracts in growing, preparing, inspecting, advising, shipping, purchasing, sampling or selling any marijuana preparations.
 
Hemp Business
 
The following is a discussion of status hemp plants in the United States and Canada. (Any discussion on hemp plants has to include the comparison to marijuana.)
 
Difference between marijuana and hemp plants:
 
Hemp vary from marijuana in its appearance, function, cultivation and applications. Marijuana leaves are either broad leafed, a tight bud, or look like a nugget with hairs, and it resembles a short fat bush. Hemp has skinny leaves concentrated at the top with a few branches below and the plant tends to be skinny and tall. Hemp plants originally were grown to make rope. In the 1800s it was customary and sometimes mandatory to grow hemp pertaining to its use in the military. More recently marijuana plants have been crossed with hemp plants and now contain cannabidiols (CBD) oils
 
Marijuana plants contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is considered a drug and is responsible for the high (psychological) effects, with marijuana plants containing from 5-30%. Hemp (to be legal) has a THC level of less than 0.3%, essentially eliminating any effect to get a high.
 
Marijuana plants can also have a high cannabidiol (CBD) content. Hemp plants do not normally have a high CBD content if any at all. Both marijuana and hemp plants containing any amount of CBD are treated as Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States. About 30 states have various regulations for the distribution of marijuana and hemp products exceeding allowed limits. On October 17, 2018, CBD became legal for recreational and medical use in Canada.
 
Market for the Company:
 
The main purpose of hemp plant extracts is in the belief that various ingredients are beneficial for your health. In addition to sub threshold amounts of THC and CBD content, there are ample amounts of essential fatty acids - omega-3 (ALA) and omega-6 (LA) from a plant-based source. It is interesting to note that vitamin E in the form of tocopherols are naturally present in hemp plants guarding against oxidation of the fatty acids. Fatty acids deteriorate in the presence of air.
 
The Company has met with several potential partners in the United States and Canada. Various pieces of land have been identified as prospects having a good water supply and suitable soil conditions. The Company is very excited at the possibility of growing hemp in the spring of 2020 partnering with landowners and farmers. The Company has access to a grower, extractor, retail sales expert, that is available to participate either as an advisor or a vendor.
 
After appropriate consultation, the Company has decided to postpone its entry into the marijuana market until federal regulations are put in place. There are several groups and organizations presently in the marijuana space and we will watch their performance first. We are devoting our energies into the hemp marketplace.
