Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements
 
This Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements that are “forward-looking” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Litigation Reform Act”). These forward looking statements and other information are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by us using information currently available.
 
The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “will,” “should” and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or using other similar expressions.
 
In accordance with the provisions of the Litigation Reform Act, we are making investors aware that such forward-looking statements, because they relate to future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Report on Form 10-K. For example, given the cessation of our operations as a developer, manufacturer, marketer and seller of advanced polymers on January 31, 2020, resulting from the sale of substantially all of our assets to an independent third party, we became engaged in efforts to identify either an (i) operating company to acquire or merge with through an equity-based exchange transaction or (ii) investor interested in purchasing a majority interest in our common stock, whereby either transaction would likely result in a change in control. If we are unable to effect a transaction with an operating company or investor, we may be required to cease all operations, including liquidation through bankruptcy proceedings. Accordingly, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof. In addition, you should read and carefully consider the Risk Factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10K. We assume no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except as required by law.
 
General
 
Business Description
 
On January 31, 2020, EKIMAS Corporation (the “Company”), formerly AdvanSource Biomaterials Corporation, sold substantially all of its assets, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated November 25, 2019 as approved by the Company’s stockholders on January 21, 2020, to Mitsubishi Chemical Performance Polymers, Inc. for a total purchase price of $7,250,000. As a result, we ceased operating as a manufacturer and seller of advanced polymers. Subsequent to January 31, 2020, we became engaged in efforts to identify an (i) operating company to acquire or merge with through an equity-based exchange transaction or (ii) investor interested in purchasing a majority interest in our common stock, whereby either transaction would likely result in a change in control. Although certain opportunities have been investigated to determine whether a potential merger or investment opportunity could add value for the benefit of our shareholders, we have not yet entered into any binding arrangements.
Corporate History
 
We were founded in 1993 as a subsidiary of PolyMedica Corporation (“PolyMedica”). In June 1996, PolyMedica distributed all of the shares of CardioTech International, Inc.’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, which PolyMedica owned, to PolyMedica stockholders of record. We were engaged in the business of developing advanced polymer materials for use in medical devices designed for treating a broad range of anatomical sites and disease states. In July 1999, we acquired the assets of Tyndale-Plains-Hunter (“TPH”), a manufacturer of specialty hydrophilic polyurethanes.

In April 2001, we acquired Catheter and Disposables Technology, Inc. (“CDT”), a contract manufacturer of advanced disposable medical devices. In April 2003, we acquired Gish Biomedical, Inc. (“Gish”), a manufacturer of single use cardiopulmonary bypass products. In the development of our business model, we reviewed the strategic fit of our various business operations and determined that CDT and Gish did not fit our strategic direction. Gish was sold in July 2007 and CDT was sold in March 2008.
 
Effective October 26, 2007, pursuant to stockholder approval, we were reincorporated from a Massachusetts corporation to a Delaware corporation. We changed our name from CardioTech International, Inc. to AdvanSource Biomaterials Corporation, effective October 15, 2008.
 
On November 25, 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Mitsubishi Chemical Performance Polymers, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“MCPP”) for the sale of substantially all of our assets for a total purchase price of $7,250,000. The Asset Purchase Agreement was approved by our stockholders on January 21, 2020. As a result, we ceased operating as a manufacturer and seller of advanced polymers on January 31, 2020 (the “Closing Date”). Subsequent to the Closing Date, we became engaged in efforts to identify an (i) operating company to acquire or merge with through an equity-based exchange transaction or (ii) investor interested in purchasing a majority interest in our common stock, whereby either transaction would likely result in a change in control. Although certain opportunities have been investigated to determine whether a potential merger or investment opportunity could add value for the benefit of our shareholders, we have not yet entered into any binding arrangements.
 
On March 3, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, which amendment was unanimously approved by our Board of Directors, to change our name AdvanSource Biomaterials Corporation to EKIMAS Corporation.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2021, we had no employees. Since February 1, 2020, Mr. Michael Adams, has served as our chief executive officer in a consultative capacity.
