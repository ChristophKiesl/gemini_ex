Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a biotechnology company that is developing innovative and proprietary treatments for muscle cramps and spasms associated with severe neurological conditions and exercise-associated muscle cramps. Our lead drug product candidate, FLX-787, is currently in exploratory Phase 2 clinical trials in Australia in patients with multiple sclerosis, or MS, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. In 2017, we expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States of FLX-787 in patients with motor neuron disease, primarily with ALS, and another Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or CMT. In 2016, we launched our consumer product, HOTSHOT®, to prevent and treat exercise-associated muscle cramps, or EAMCs. 
FLX-787, HOTSHOT and our other drug product candidates are based on the potential mechanism of action we describe as Chemical Neuro Stimulation, which is the process by which a chemical signal, acting topically, induces a neuronal sensory signal that produces a beneficial effect. Our product candidates activate certain receptors in primary sensory neurons, which then act via neuronal circuits to reduce the repetitive firing, or hyperexcitability, of alpha-motor neurons in the spinal cord, thereby preventing or reducing the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps and spasms. We believe that we are the only company developing both drug and consumer products based on this mechanism of muscle cramp inhibition.
Muscle cramps and spasms are involuntary, often painful, contractions producing tightness in muscles that can last several minutes and, in many instances, result in prolonged soreness. Muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity are thought to result from the hyperexcitability of alpha-motor neurons. FLX-787 and HOTSHOT activate the specific transient receptor potential, or TRP, ion channel receptors found on the surface of the mouth, esophagus and/or stomach, which triggers signals in sensory neurons that are relayed to the spinal cord. This sensory signaling is thought to increase the activity of inhibitory spinal interneurons, which reduces alpha-motor neuron hyperexcitability, thereby preventing muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity.
In 2016, we began enrolling exploratory clinical trials in Australia of FLX-787 in patients suffering from cramps, spasms and spasticity associated with MS and ALS. In 2017, we expect to initiate, subject to the review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, of our investigational new drug application, or IND, a Phase 2 parallel designed, clinical trial in the United States of FLX-787 in patients with motor neuron disease, primarily with ALS. In order to accelerate this Phase 2 parallel designed clinical trial, we may include patients from the sites in our Australian trial in patients with ALS. In 2017, we also expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in the United States of FLX-787 in patients with CMT, subject to the FDA's review of our IND and associated protocol. 
According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, between 250,000 and 350,000 people in the United States suffer from MS, approximately 84% of whom experience spasticity. Approximately 20,000 people in the United States suffer from ALS, many of whom will experience painful muscle cramps at some point in their disease progression. CMT is the most common form of inherited neuromuscular disease, affecting an estimated 150,000 people in the United States. A large majority of CMT patients experience muscle cramps frequently, which interferes with motor performance, exercise, activities of daily living, sleep and quality of life. 
HOTSHOT is our consumer beverage containing a proprietary formulation of TRP activators. We market HOTSHOT to endurance athletes, who drink it before, during and after exercise to prevent and treat EAMCs. The majority of HOTSHOT sales are generated through our branded website and third-party websites. We also sell HOTSHOT to select retailers in a limited number of geographic areas with strong endurance sports markets. In 2017, we expect to expand our retail presence and will be increasing the number of geographic areas that we target.
Our Scientific Approach
Research has shown that muscle cramping is caused by the uncontrolled and repetitive firing of alpha-motor neurons in the spinal cord, resulting in maintained contraction of the muscle. We believe that by reducing this firing of the alpha-motor neurons that control muscle contraction, muscle cramping can be reduced or prevented.
Motor neurons respond to inputs from complex circuits in the spinal cord that both (A) reduce neuronal and muscle activity, known as “inhibitory” input, and (B) increase neuronal and muscle activity, known as "excitatory" input. Our approach exploits a general principle of neural circuits: that strong excitatory input from one source in the body 
1

enhances overall inhibitory tone in the spinal cord and thereby reduces neuronal response to other excitation throughout the body.
The activation of ion channels forms the basis of our scientific approach and our scientific co-founder, Roderick MacKinnon, M.D., is a leader in this field. Dr. MacKinnon was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2003 for his work determining the structure of ion channels and showing the mechanism by which they select for particular ions (Doyle, et al., The Structure of the Potassium Channel: Molecular Basis of K+ Conduction and Selectivity, April 1998, Science). The TRP vanilloid-1, or TRPV1, receptor is important in diverse physiological functions and the TRPV1 ion channel acts as a receptor that reacts to multiple sensory inputs. TRPV1 is activated by heat, low pH and a variety of molecules.
The TRP subfamily A, member 1, or TRPA1, ion channel is a channel in the cell membrane that can be activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including cold temperature and a variety of pungent natural chemical agents. TRPA1 ion channels are expressed mainly in primary sensory neurons associated with slow-conducting C-fibers and carry signals directly to the spinal cord.
We refer to the mechanism of action of our product candidates as Chemical Neuro Stimulation, which is the process by which a chemical signal, acting topically, induces a neuronal sensory signal that produces a beneficial effect. FLX-787, HOTSHOT and our other drug product candidates stimulate primary sensory neurons in the mouth, esophagus and/or stomach by activating TRPV1 and TRPA1 ion channels. These sensory neurons project both directly and indirectly to the spinal cord, and we believe that their activation enhances the overall inhibitory tone in spinal cord circuits, which reduces repetitive firing of the alpha-motor neurons throughout the body and thereby prevents or reduces the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps and spasms. Muscle contractions associated with spasms and spasticity are also believed to result from abnormal repetitive firing of alpha-motor neurons.
We believe that FLX-787, HOTSHOT and our other drug product candidates directly interact with TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels in a topical and local fashion and trigger strong, centrally-acting excitatory signals from peripheral sensory neurons in the mucus membranes of the mouth, throat, esophagus and stomach. In our studies to date, using sensitive validated bioanalytical methods, we have not been able to demonstrate FLX-787 reaching the bloodstream, which we believe limits the potential for systemic side-effects. We believe this mechanism and the lack of systemic exposure should reduce any drug-drug interactions.
Our founders developed an extract formulation containing TRP activators that the FDA has deemed to be generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, when used in ingested food. Following the positive results of our extract formulation tested in our electrically-induced cramp model, we analyzed the extract formulation and identified two compounds, FLX-787 and FLX-788, as the most likely active components of the extract formulation, both of which activate the TRPV1 and TRPA1 ion channels. Our drug development efforts are currently focused on developing FLX-787 for the treatment of patients with cramps, spasms and spasticity associated with severe neurological conditions. 
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to become a leading biotechnology company focused on treating muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity associated with severe neurological conditions and EAMCs. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:

• | Advance FLX-787 for the treatment of severe neurological conditions of significant unmet need. FLX-787 is currently being evaluated in Australia in randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over clinical trials in patients suffering from cramps, spasms and/or spasticity associated with MS and ALS. In 2017, we expect to commence, in the United States, a parallel designed, Phase 2 clinical trial of FLX-787 in patients with motor neuron disease, primarily with ALS, and a second Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with CMT, subject to the FDA’s review of our IND and associated protocols.


• | Drive adoption and recurring use of HOTSHOT for the prevention and treatment of EAMCs. We are building awareness, adoption and repetitive use of HOTSHOT among key opinion leaders and core endurance athletes, who we believe are interested in scientifically-proven products. We believe that, over time, these athletes will act as opinion leaders and their endorsement and use will drive future adoption by a broader audience. As our brand and target market evolve, we anticipate evaluating product line extension opportunities based on a variety of factors, including market opportunity, brand positioning, target audience and product formulation alternatives. We are also working with universities to study other benefits of HOTSHOT that may broaden the appeal and use of HOTSHOT.

• | Collaborate selectively to augment and accelerate the research and development of our drug product candidates. We may seek third-party collaborators for the development and eventual commercialization of any drug product candidate we develop. In particular, we may enter into third-party arrangements for targeted neurological indications in which our potential collaborator has particular expertise or for which we need access to additional markets and research, development or commercialization resources.


• | Explore opportunities with marketing, distribution or national retail partners to expand the use of HOTSHOT. We may seek opportunities with strategic partners to accelerate the awareness and use of HOTSHOT by consumers. We may also collaborate with strategic partners to develop new consumer products and explore additional commercial opportunities for HOTSHOT.


• | Selectively develop additional compounds to treat cramps and spasms in neurological conditions. We have chosen FLX-787 as our lead drug product candidate to treat patients with MS, CMT and motor neuron disease, including ALS. FLX-787, FLX-788, FLX-797 and FLX-798 each demonstrated a statistically significant effect in reducing muscle cramps in our electrically-induced cramp model. We may elect to continue the development of these molecules in MS, CMT, ALS or other indications.

FLX-787 
FLX-787 is a single molecule, chemically synthesized, TRP ion channel activator that has demonstrated dose dependent human efficacy in our electrically-induced cramp model. We believe FLX-787 may relieve cramps, spasms and spasticity affecting individuals suffering from severe neurological conditions, including MS, CMT and motor neuron diseases such as ALS. 
Human Efficacy Demonstrated in Electrically-Induced Cramp Model
We have tested the efficacy of FLX-787 in reducing the intensity of muscle cramps in our electrically-induced human cramp model. In this model, we induce muscle cramping in the flexor hallucis brevis muscle, a small muscle on the bottom of the big toe, using electrical stimulation. We then measure the duration and intensity of the subject's cramp using electromyography, or EMG. EMG is a technique used for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles and produces a record called an electromyogram. To measure a subject's muscle cramp, we calculate the area under the curve, or AUC, produced by the electromyogram. Muscle cramp intensity and duration vary by subject, so each study begins by inducing a cramp in each subject in order to create a “baseline AUC.” This baseline AUC is later compared to the AUC after the subject receives either the study article or a vehicle control without active ingredients. The time at which the subject receives the study article or vehicle control is referred to as timepoint zero. We then attempt to induce muscle cramps using electrical stimulation at various times following timepoint zero. At each timepoint, we measure the subject's cramp intensity and duration using the EMG recording sensors and then compare each AUC against the baseline AUC. We believe that if a subject's AUC at the subsequent timepoints is smaller than the subject's baseline AUC, then the study article successfully prevented or reduced the intensity of the subject's muscle cramp.
FLX-787 and FLX-788 are constituent molecules of the original extract formulation of TRP activators developed by our co-founders, and FLX-797 and FLX-798 are combinations of the constituent molecules in this extract formulation. FLX-787, FLX-788, FLX-797 and FLX-798 were each tested in nine healthy volunteers using our electrically-induced cramp model and were observed to decrease cramp intensity (see Figure 1 below). Using a generalized linear mixed model (Tukey-Kramer post-hoc), FLX-787, FLX-788, FLX-797 and FLX-798 treatment arms significantly reduced cramp intensity relative to control (p<0.01), with both FLX-787 and FLX-788 providing a significant improvement in efficacy compared to the extract formulation. 
In a separate study of five subjects, FLX-787, formulated as an orally disintegrating tablet, or ODT, reduced the intensity and duration of electrically-induced muscle cramps in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). Six doses (0.5, 2.5, 7, 19, 33 and 56 mg) of FLX-787 showed an effect consistent with a classic sigmoidal dose response curve, with virtually no effect at the lowest doses and a maximal effect at the highest doses (see Figure 2 below).

Figure 1 | Figure 2


Previous studies have shown a correlation between electrically-induced cramping and individual susceptibility to naturally occurring cramping. As a result, we believe that the use of our electrically-induced muscle cramping technique is an effective tool for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of naturally occurring muscle cramping.
Clinical Trials of FLX-787 in Patients with Severe Neurological Conditions
FLX-787 is currently being evaluated in Australia in randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over clinical trials in patients suffering from cramps, spasms and/or spasticity associated with MS and ALS. In 2017, we expect to begin Phase 2 randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled parallel designed clinical trials in the United States of FLX-787 in patients with motor neuron disease, primarily with ALS, and CMT, subject to the FDA’s review of our IND and associated protocols. 
The FDA has never approved a drug to treat cramping in a neurological condition and, as a result, we are evaluating a number of different endpoints in our trials. Our Australian clinical trials of MS and ALS patients are designed as exploratory trials to determine the effect of FLX-787 across a broad range of potential endpoints with no pre-specified primary endpoint. We expect our Phase 2 clinical trials in the United States in patients with motor neuron disease and CMT will include changes in cramp frequency as the primary endpoint and we may include one or more key secondary endpoints. We have chosen change in cramp frequency as the primary endpoint based, in part, upon feedback we received from the FDA for a proposed trial in patients with nocturnal leg cramps. The FDA may not agree that the endpoints we have chosen for our trials are appropriate for a trial of patients with motor neuron disease and/or CMT, and either the FDA or we may identify alternative endpoints that are more appropriate to study in our future clinical trials of FLX-787. 
Multiple Sclerosis
Background. MS is an autoimmune disease in which inflammatory processes cause worsening demyelination and cell degeneration over years, resulting in a variety of neurological deficits such as loss of muscle control, sensation and vision. Spasticity is caused by damage to motor systems in the brain and spinal cord. These lesions cause hyperactive muscle stretch reflexes, which result in increased muscle tone and associated symptoms such as myoclonus which are subsumed under the descriptive term spasticity. The need to treat spasticity increases as the disease progresses and goes hand in hand with worsening weakness, leading to complications such as contractures, bed sores and severe pain. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, between 250,000 and 350,000 people in the United States suffer from MS and approximately 84% of patients with MS experience spasticity. We believe that a significant number of MS patients also experience muscle cramps and/or spasms.

Limitations of Current Treatment. Patients suffering from MS spasticity may be treated with antispasticity drugs, muscle relaxants, sedatives and Botox injections, which frequently result in unwanted side effects, including dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, fatigue, weakness, diarrhea or constipation and low blood pressure. Further, patient responses to single or combination agents vary and treatments may be incomplete in managing spasticity.
MS Clinical Trial. In 2016, we began enrolling a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled exploratory clinical trial of 19 mg of FLX-787, formulated as a liquid, in MS patients. The trial includes a 14-day run-in period during which patients receive a placebo and record their experience with cramps, spasms and/or spasticity. At the end of this run-in period, patients may be excluded from the trial if they are deemed to have responded to placebo. Following this run-in period, patients receive either FLX-787 or a placebo during the first 14-day treatment period before “crossing-over” to the other treatment for an additional 14-day treatment period. We expect to include up to 60 patients in the trial and will evaluate a number of endpoints relating to spasms/cramping frequency, spasticity, pain, quality of life, sleep and safety. 
Motor Neuron Disease and ALS 
Background. Motor neuron disease is a progressive disease that leads to motor neuron degeneration, dysfunction and eventual neuronal death in the brain and spinal cord.  Motor neuron disease includes diseases such as ALS, primary lateral sclerosis, and progressive muscular atrophy and related disorders that affect the upper and lower motor neurons.  Motor neuron degeneration leads to progressive loss of voluntary motor control and is often associated with muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity resulting in increased pain, reduced function and decreased quality of life. ALS is a neurological disease that affects approximately 20,000 people in the United States and causes muscle weakness and impacts physical function. In most patients, doctors do not know why ALS occurs, which are referred to as sporadic cases. A small number of familial cases are known to occur. ALS often begins with muscle twitching and weakness in an arm or leg, or sometimes with slurring of speech. Eventually, ALS can affect the ability to control the muscles needed to move, speak, eat and breathe. ALS patients commonly experience fasciculations, which are persistent muscle twitches that can interfere with sleep, and many patients with ALS experience painful muscle cramps. 
Limitations of Current Treatment. The October 2009 American Academy of Neurology ALS Care Guidelines found insufficient data to support or refute any specific interventions for the treatment of muscle cramps, twitches and spasticity in ALS patients. The guidelines did note that in diseases such as MS, effective treatments for similar problems include benzodiazepines, baclofen, dantrolene and tizanidine, all of which cause sedation in patients.
Motor Neuron Disease and ALS Clinical Trials. In 2016, we began enrolling a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled exploratory clinical trial of 20 mg of FLX-787, formulated as an ODT, in ALS patients in Australia. Similar to our MS trial, our Australian ALS trial includes a 14-day placebo run-in period, followed by treatment periods where patients receive either FLX-787 or a placebo in the first 14-day treatment period before “crossing-over” to the other treatment for an additional 14-day treatment period. The trial is designed to include up to 50 patients and to evaluate a number of endpoints relating to spasms/cramping frequency, spasticity, pain, quality of life, sleep and safety. 
In 2017, we expect to begin enrolling a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of FLX-787, formulated as an ODT, in patients with motor neuron disease in the United States, subject to the FDA's review of our IND. We expect this trial will primarily include ALS patients, but it may also include patients with other motor neuron diseases. We also expect this trial will include a 28-day run-in period during which patients will receive a placebo and record their experience with cramps, spasms and/or spasticity. At the end of this run-in period, patients may be excluded from the trial if they are deemed to have responded to placebo. Unlike our Australian clinical trial of ALS patients, our U.S. clinical trial of ALS patients will be a parallel designed trial in which subjects receive either FLX-787 or placebo for a 28-day treatment period with no subsequent "cross-over" period. In this trial, we expect to evaluate changes in cramp frequency as the primary endpoint, with a number of secondary endpoints.
We believe the parallel design of our U.S. trial of ALS patients provides regulatory and operational benefits to the cross-over trial being conducted in Australia. As a result, we may ultimately decide to streamline our ALS development efforts and complete only our parallel designed Phase 2 clinical trial and include patients from the Australian sites in the U.S. trial. 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
Background. CMT is the most common form of inherited neuromuscular disease, affecting an estimated 150,000 people in the United States. It occurs in populations worldwide with a prevalence of about 1 in 2,500 individuals. The primary clinical features of this disease are slowly progressive distal weakness, muscle atrophy affecting the 
5

feet and legs and sensory loss. The presence of muscle cramps in hands, fingers and other muscles commonly experienced by CMT patients is consistent with the hypothesis that hyperexcitability underlies muscles cramps. Patients with CMT usually do not suffer from spasticity or other central nervous system symptoms, as the underlying pathology affects the peripheral nerve. A large majority of CMT patients experience muscle cramps frequently, in many muscles, which can interfere with motor performance, exercise, activities of daily living, sleep and quality of life for many patients. 
Limitations of Current Treatment. There are no drug products approved by the FDA to treat cramps in patients with CMT. Several symptomatic therapies are used but data from randomized controlled trials of these therapies are lacking.
CMT Clinical Trial. In 2017, we expect to begin enrolling a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of FLX-787, formulated as an ODT, in CMT patients, subject to the FDA's review of our IND and associated protocol. We expect the trial will include a 28-day run-in period during which patients receive a placebo and record their experience with cramps and/or spasms. At the end of this run-in period, patients may be excluded from the trial if they are deemed to have responded to placebo. Similar to our proposed U.S. clinical trial of ALS patients, our CMT clinical trial will be a parallel designed trial with patients receiving either FLX-787 or placebo for a 28-day treatment period. In this trial, we expect to evaluate changes in cramp frequency as the primary endpoint, with a number of secondary endpoints. 
Nocturnal Leg Cramps 
Background. Nocturnal leg cramps are muscle cramps, usually occurring in the calf during sleep, that cause pain, stress, disability and poor sleep quality in affected individuals resulting in reduced quality of life and interference with activities of daily living. The prevalence of nocturnal leg cramps is widespread and increases with age. According to a survey of 233 individuals, 37% of adults over the age of 50 suffered from nocturnal leg cramps. Based on a separate survey of 365 individuals, 50% of adults over the age of 65 suffered from nocturnal leg cramps. 
Limitations of Current Treatment. We do not believe any therapy has been shown to be safe and effective in treating nocturnal leg cramps in well-designed, blinded clinical trials. Stretching and systemic treatments, such as dietary supplements, vasodilators and calcium channel blockers, have shown some benefit in treating nocturnal leg cramps, but we do not believe any medication has shown durable evidence of clinical efficacy. Quinine is prescribed in the United Kingdom for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps. However, quinine is associated with serious and life-threatening adverse events and, in 1994, the FDA banned the use of over-the-counter quinine for the treatment of leg cramps and expanded this restriction for prescription quinine products in 2006.
Nocturnal Leg Cramp Clinical Studies. We have conducted three studies in subjects with nocturnal leg cramps. In the first study, reported in February 2016, we evaluated our extract formulation in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over design study of 50 subjects. Statistically significant effects were demonstrated on key endpoints in the study, including cramp frequency (p<0.05), cramp-free days (p<0.01), the physician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (p<0.01), cramp pain measures (p<0.05), and specific sleep disturbance measures (p<0.05). There were no serious adverse events reported in the study.
In a second study, reported in October 2016, we evaluated multiple dosages of FLX-787, formulated as both a liquid and an ODT, in four rapidly successive cross-over periods. The 29 subjects in this study had participated in our prior nocturnal leg cramps study. Muscle cramp frequency was reduced (p<0.05) at two weeks in the parallel portion of the first phase. In the cross-over data sets, efficacy (p<0.05) was generally seen for the pre-specified endpoints of muscle cramp frequency and cramp free nights in the early study arms. In the latter arms, FLX-787 did not show statistical significance versus placebo, which we believe may have resulted from a potential carryover effect. There were no serious adverse events reported in the study.
In October 2016, we also reported results from the first portion of the third study, which evaluated FLX-787 in 72 subjects who reported to suffer from nocturnal leg cramps. The study did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference versus placebo on the pre-specified endpoints of muscle cramp frequency or cramp-free nights. A number of concerns have been identified that we believe impact the data interpretation from this study, including concerns relating to patient selection. These issues appear to have been concentrated at one of the three clinical recruitment sites in the study. When data from this site are excluded and analysis is restricted to patients from the two other sites (n=37), FLX-787 shows a strong statistical trend in reducing muscle cramp frequency (p=0.06) during the initial two-week parallel portion of the study versus placebo as compared to the baseline run-in period. 
6

The data we received from the second part of this study were generally consistent with the data from the first part of the study. There were no serious adverse events reported in either part of the study. 
Given the subsequent concerns regarding patient selection in our third study, we also conducted an analysis of subjects likely to have NLC based upon a questionnaire administered after the study was completed. Of the respondents to the questionnaire, 26 subjects were identified, in a blinded manner, as likely having nocturnal leg cramps. An analysis of the first treatment exposure in both parts of the study for the subjects showed a statistically significant effect in the reduction in cramp frequency when compared to placebo (p=0.03).
In January 2017, we decided to delay further development of FLX-787 for nocturnal leg cramps and focus our drug development efforts on severe neurological conditions. 
Other Potential Indications
We may also pursue the use of our drug product candidates in several other conditions where muscle cramps, spasms or abnormal muscle contractions afflict patients, including spasms due to brain injury such as in stroke or cerebral palsy or trauma, cervical dystonia, spasticity as a result of spinal cord injury, focal dystonias (e.g. blepharospasm), other peripheral neuropathies (e.g. diabetic), fibromyalgia, Machado-Joseph disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia, cramp fasciculation syndrome, cramps due to renal failure (during dialysis) or liver cirrhosis, spasmodic dysphonia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, piriformis syndrome, lower lumbar radiculopathy and neuromyotonias (focal).
HOTSHOT 
In June 2016, we launched our first consumer product, HOTSHOT, which is marketed to endurance athletes that experience EAMCs and was our only source of revenue during 2016. HOTSHOT’s efficacy is based on the same potential mechanism of action of Chemical Neuro Stimulation as our drug product candidates but is formulated as a consumer beverage with a lower amount of TRP activators. 
Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramps
Background. EAMCs are painful, involuntary contractions of a skeletal muscle that occur during or following exercise in individuals and result in acute pain, stiffness, bulging or knotting of the muscle and soreness that can last for several days. EAMCs can be experienced by individuals participating in any sport, but EAMCs are particularly prevalent in athletes engaged in high-intensity activities, such as triathlons, marathons and cycling events. 
Limitations of Current Products. There are a number of well-known sports drinks and other consumer products that are intended to treat electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration. However, we do not believe clinical studies have proven that these factors, in isolation, cause EAMCs. Scientists recently began hypothesizing that altered neuromuscular control, as a result of muscle fatigue, causes EAMCs. While there are other companies that market their muscle cramping products to endurance athletes participating in high-intensity sports, we believe HOTSHOT is the only product that has been shown to be scientifically effective in treating muscle cramps.
HOTSHOT for the Prevention and Treatment of Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramps
HOTSHOT is a beverage that athletes take before, during and after exercise to prevent and treat muscle cramps. It is based on our founders’ original extract formulation of TRP activators. We tested several different formulations of the active ingredients from this extract formulation to refine the taste while ensuring continued efficacy in treating and preventing muscle cramps. We also added emulsifiers and flavoring agents, in order to develop a more appealing consumer product. HOTSHOT includes organic ingredients and is priced at a premium to many existing sports beverages. As our brand and target markets evolve, we anticipate evaluating product line extension opportunities and believe that the breadth of our consumer products will depend on a variety of factors, including market opportunity, brand positioning, target audience and product formulation alternatives. 
HOTSHOT Brand Strategy
We believe there is a significant opportunity to commercialize an efficacious product for treating and preventing EAMCs under a culturally relevant lifestyle brand. Our product is marketed primarily to endurance athletes participating in high endurance sports, such as triathlons, marathons and cycling events. Our marketing materials and branded website highlight HOTSHOT’s efficacy and the scientific origins of and support for HOTSHOT. 
7

We are building awareness and adoption of HOTSHOT among key opinion leaders and core endurance athletes, who we believe are interested in scientifically-proven products. We increase awareness and demand using a number of different tools, including attendance and sponsorship of endurance events, endorsements from endurance athletes, the use of targeted digital, print and social media campaigns, sales and marketing campaigns focused on key geographic areas and public relations activities. We believe that, over time, these athletes will act as opinion leaders and their endorsement and use will drive future adoption by a broader audience.
To explain the science behind HOTSHOT, we highlight the importance of an athlete’s nerves and muscles working together to prevent and treat muscle cramps, which we refer to as neuromuscular performance, or NMP. Respondents to a customer survey indicate that many of our customers perceive benefits of HOTSHOT beyond cramping, including benefits relating to reduced muscle soreness, increased ability to exert oneself and reduced muscle fatigue. We are working with leading academic centers to study these potential benefits. 
HOTSHOT Distribution 
We use e-commerce strategies to sell online through our direct-to-consumer website and through third-party websites, including a retailer that offers international shipping. In 2016, we focused our sales and marketing efforts on a limited number of geographic areas with strong endurance sports markets, including Los Angeles, California, Boulder, Colorado and Boston, Massachusetts. In 2017, we expect to expand these core geographic markets to include several additional cities. In each of these locations, we build brand awareness by attending endurance sports events and distributing HOTSHOT to leading retailers, such as cycling, running and triathlon stores. Over time, we may expand to more mainstream distribution channels, including national retailers. 
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, consumer products, technology and know-how, and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries.
Patents and Patent Applications
Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current and future drug product candidates and consumer products, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. Our commercial success will depend in part upon whether we are able to obtain and maintain adequate protection against unauthorized third-party use of our products and technologies. In our efforts to do so, however, there are a number of risks we may face, any of which may hinder our ability to successfully market our potential products. For more information regarding risks related to patents and other intellectual property, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property."
We own a first family of applications, including two pending U.S. utility patent applications and one European patent application directed to compositions and methods of using those compositions for preventing, treating or ameliorating muscle cramping. A patent based on these applications, if issued, would have a statutory expiration in both the United States and Europe in July 2031. 
We also own a second family of patent applications, including one utility patent application that is pending in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the Eurasian Patent Organization, Europe, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa. This application is directed to methods for preventing and treating various muscle-related conditions and disorders and methods of diagnosing and selecting a patient for treatment. The patent applications also include various uses of TRP activators, formulations, compositions of chemical matter, and enabling technology such as the electrical stimulation technique for inducing muscle cramps.
We also own additional families of applications, including one PCT application and three provisional patent applications. These applications are directed at various aspects of our work including influencing neuromuscular activity by stimulating a TRP channel in the nerve ending of a sensory neuron. The PCT application will enter the national phase in April 2018. A patent based on the PCT application, if issued, would have a statutory expiration in October 2036. A patent based on the pending provisional applications would, if issued, have a statutory expiration in June 2037 or January 2038.

We also own one design patent application directed to the design of one of our bottles. The international patent application was granted in September 2016, and we are currently awaiting the outcome of the designations in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, South America, and the United States. The statutory expiration of the design patents will vary based on jurisdiction. If issued in the United States, the design patent will expire fifteen years after the date of grant. 
While we seek broad coverage for our patents, there is always a risk that an alteration to the formulation of our drug product candidates and consumer products may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims by us.
Trade Secrets, Trademarks and Proprietary Information
Our drug product candidates and consumer product have gone through numerous iterations to optimize their effectiveness, thereby creating trade secrets and proprietary know-how. In particular, the formulation of our consumer product will be treated as a trade secret. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees to execute Proprietary Information, Inventions, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition Agreements upon the commencement of their employment. Consultants and other advisors are required to sign consulting agreements. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third-parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, and utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during their employment with us, shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials.
We have received trademark protection from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, and several foreign bodies for certain of our marks and will continue to apply for trademark protection with the USPTO and applicable foreign bodies for our brand. Issuance of a federally registered trademark creates a rebuttable presumption of ownership of the mark, but may be subject to challenge by others claiming first use in the mark in some or all of the areas in which it is used. Federally registered trademarks have a perpetual life, as long as they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used properly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third-parties to seek cancellation of the trademarks if they claim priority or confusion of usage. We believe that trademarks will be an important element of our ability to successfully market our consumer products.
Royalty Agreement
In connection with the transfer of certain intellectual property to us by certain of our founders, or collectively the Founders, on March 20, 2014, we entered into a royalty agreement with the Founders. Pursuant to the royalty agreement, we are obligated to pay the Founders a royalty of 2%, in the aggregate, of gross sales of any product sold by us or by any of our licensees for use in the treatment of any neuromuscular disorders, and that uses, incorporates or embodies, or made using any of our intellectual property, including any know-how. The royalty agreement grants the Founders certain audit rights and requires any license or sublicense granted by us be consistent with the terms and conditions of the royalty agreement. Each Founder may assign his rights and obligations under the royalty agreement to a third party upon prior written notice to us and we may not assign our rights and obligations thereunder except in the event of a change in control relating to our company. The term of the royalty agreement is perpetual.
Manufacturing
We do not currently have our own manufacturing facilities. We intend to continue to use our financial resources to focus on commercializing HOTSHOT and developing our drug product candidates, and we do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We intend to meet our pre-clinical and clinical trial manufacturing requirements by establishing relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers to perform these services for us.
We rely on a network of third-party manufacturers to supply materials and produce HOTSHOT. Several contract suppliers provide us with raw materials and our co-packer converts these raw materials into finished goods available for sale. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a sole source third-party co-packer to produce, bottle and package HOTSHOT and have entered into a production agreement with this co-packer. We rely on a third party as the sole source for certain of the raw materials in HOTSHOT and have entered into a supply agreement with this supplier. There can be no assurance our sole source third-party manufacturer and suppliers will 
9

meet our commercial demands in a timely manner or that we will be to identify and establish relationships with qualified additional or back-up suppliers and manufacturers. 
Sales and Marketing
We currently have limited marketing, sales or distribution capabilities, which we established in connection with the launch of HOTSHOT. In order to commercialize any drug product candidate that is approved for commercial sale, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third parties that have sales and marketing experience. 
Drug Products
We may elect to establish our own sales force to market and sell a drug product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. If the geographic market for the product is limited or the prescriptions for the product will be written principally by a relatively small number of physicians, we may elect to market and sell the products ourselves. We do not expect to establish direct sales capabilities until shortly before the products are approved for commercial sale.
We may also seek third party support from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for those products that would benefit from the promotional support of a large sales and marketing force. In these cases, we might seek to promote our products in collaboration with marketing partners or rely on relationships with one or more companies with large established sales forces and distribution systems.
HOTSHOT
We launched HOTSHOT in June 2016 and, to date, our marketing efforts have focused on building brand awareness of HOTSHOT among key opinion leaders and core endurance athletes. To drive product trial, we use a variety of sales and marketing strategies, including sponsorships of endurance events, endorsements from endurance athletes, public relations campaigns, print and digital media campaigns, social media advertisements, product sampling and promotional activities at events such as marathons, triathlons, cycling events and obstacle course races. We anticipate leveraging early adopters to drive product and messaging advocacy and using targeted digital and social media campaigns to expand product sales. 
We use e-commerce strategies to sell online through our direct-to-consumer website and through third-party websites, including a retailer that offers international shipping. We initially targeted select geographic markets in order to develop this core group of early adopters, including Los Angeles, California, Boulder, Colorado and Boston, Massachusetts, and expect to expand beyond these cities to several additional geographies in 2017. We have a limited sales force focused on each of these locations to accelerate distribution of our product initially through specialty retailers, such as cycling, running and triathlon stores. Over time, we may expand our distribution to more mainstream channels, including national retailers. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our drug product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, durability, safety, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
For patients suffering from MS spasticity, the current treatments include muscle relaxants, sedatives and Botox injections. Other biotechnology companies are currently developing drug products to treat MS spasticity, including Xenoport, Inc., which is developing a r-Baclofen Prodrug, and GW Pharma, which markets Sativex.
The October 2009 American Academy of Neurology ALS Care Guidelines found insufficient data to support or refute any specific interventions for the treatment of muscle cramps, twitches and spasticity in ALS patients. The guidelines did note that in diseases such as MS, effective treatments for similar problems include benzodiazepines, baclofen, dantrolene and tizanidine.
10

There are no drug products approved by the FDA to treat cramps in patients with CMT. Several symptomatic therapies are used but data from a randomized controlled studies of this therapies are lacking.
HOTSHOT competes against traditional beverage companies, sports beverage companies and companies developing dietary supplements. We believe the principal elements of competition in the consumer product industry will be price, taste, selection, brand recognition, brand loyalty, distribution channel offerings and the effectiveness of the product. 
For nocturnal leg cramps, systemic treatments, such as dietary supplements, vasodilators and calcium channel blockers, are utilized as treatment, but we do not believe any medication has shown evidence of clinical efficacy. Quinine is taken by some individuals outside the United States but the FDA banned the use of quinine for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps in 1994 and it is presently available only for the prescription treatment of malaria and its labeling contains a boxed warning against use in treating nocturnal leg cramps.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any drug candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the corresponding foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Conventional foods, while generally not subject to premarket review, still must comply with numerous manufacturing, labeling and other regulations.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, or other applicable regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA's laws and regulations pertaining to the conduct of human clinical studies, collectively referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, and according to the International Council for Harmonization, or ICH, GCP guidelines, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;


• | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, for a proposed new drug;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA's requirements for current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.

11

The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain.
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the non-clinical testing stage, also referred to as pre-clinical testing. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy subjects or patients with the target disease under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor's control. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA's regulations which reflect the ICH GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted only in patients having the specific disease. 


• | Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse events and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule for patients having the specific disease. 


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Generally, at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. In some cases, the FDA has approved a drug based on the results of a single adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 study of excellent design and which provided highly reliable and statistically strong evidence of important clinical benefit, such as an effect on survival, and a confirmatory study would have been difficult to conduct on ethical grounds. 

12

Post-approval studies, also referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process.
Progress reports detailing the status of drug development and results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects or patients. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to study subjects.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
FDA Review and Approval Processes
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has 12 months after submission of an NDA in which to complete its initial review of a standard new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and eight months for a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for review of standard and priority review NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by additional three month review periods whenever the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review cycle.
The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the drug approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations regarding conduct of clinical trials for the product's trials. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information.
The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the 
13

criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA will issue a "complete response" letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post approval studies, referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product's safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising requirements include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug's approved labeling (known as "off-label use"), rules for conducting industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and future commercial quantities of our products. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA's cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are also required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA. These restrictions may include suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a consent decree of permanent injunction, which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
U.S. Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company's NDA. If the new drug is a new chemical entity subject to an NDA, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by 
14

the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Conventional Food Regulation
HOTSHOT is regulated as a conventional food. Treatment or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps are a particular indication that the FDA stated, in a Federal Register notice in 2000 (65 Fed. Reg. 1031), qualifies as a structure/function claim or intended use, although it can also be targeted by drug products. Structure/function claims that focus on effects derived from nutritive value may be made for conventional foods. Food products are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and abroad with respect to their safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution. The manufacture, packaging, labeling, holding, sale, and distribution of foods are also subject to extensive local, state, and foreign government regulation. The Bureau of Customs and Border Patrol, or CBP, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, also regulates shipments containing conventional foods and engages in enforcement activity in concert with the FDA to block the import or export of articles deemed adulterated or otherwise unlawful for sale in the United States (imports) or in the non-U.S. country to which articles are addressed. Import holds on articles or demands for recall can interfere with the timely delivery of products to market and can result in regulatory fines and penalties.
The FDCA requires that substances added to food must either be approved food additives or must be generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, for their intended use. GRAS status can be documented through several means: an applicable FDA regulation, a notification that is submitted to FDA and to which the agency responds that it has no questions, or through a “self-determination” based on the views of scientific experts that is not submitted to the agency. For ingredients that are the subject of a GRAS “self-determination,” either by us or by our suppliers, there can be no assurance that FDA will agree with the GRAS assessment. Moreover, the agency can and has revised the status of GRAS ingredients, as it did in June 2015 when FDA revoked the GRAS status of partially hydrogenated oils. 
The FDA, a state Attorney General, or others could object to the positioning of our consumer product as a conventional food rather than a dietary supplement. The FDA issued a guidance document in 2014 objecting to the marketing of dietary supplements in the form of conventional beverages. The guidance explains that FDA will consider such factors as the labeling and advertising, product name, product packaging, serving size and recommended daily intake, recommendations and directions for use, marketing practices, and composition when determining whether a product is lawfully marketed as a conventional food. We believe we have designed each of these elements in a way that is appropriate for a conventional food, but cannot rule out the possibility that the FDA or another party could take the position that the product must be regulated as a dietary supplement, requiring changes to the label and potentially to the formulation.
The FDA generally prohibits labeling a food with any "health claim" (i.e., any statement associating a nutrient with risk-reduction, but not treatment, of a disease or health-related condition), unless the claim is pre-approved by the FDA. The FDA prohibits entirely disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment claims when made for a food. Additionally, nutrient content claims, or claims that implicitly or expressly characterize the levels of a nutrient found in a food, may only be made in accordance with FDA regulations. However, other claims, including so-called "structure/function claims," are permitted to be included in labeling for foods without FDA pre-approval. Such statements may describe how a food affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a food may affect the structure, function or well-being of the body, but such statements may not state that a food will reduce the risk or incidence of a disease unless such claim has been reviewed and approved by the FDA as a health claim. Structure/function claims used in labeling must be supported by evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. There can be no assurance, however, that the FDA will not determine that a particular structure/function claim that we want to use is an unacceptable disease claim or an unauthorized nutrient-disease relationship claim otherwise permitted with FDA approval as a "health claim." Such a determination might prevent the use of such a claim.
The regulation of foods may increase or become more restrictive in the future. There can be no assurance that, if more stringent statutes are enacted for foods, or if more stringent regulations are promulgated, we will be able to comply with such statutes or regulations without incurring substantial expense.
15

The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA concerning all of the products it regulates, including powers to issue a public "warning letter" to a company, to quarantine and prohibit the sale of products deemed adulterated or misbranded, to publicize information about illegal products, to request a voluntary recall of illegal products from the market, to request that the Department of Justice initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution in U.S. courts, and to seek disgorgement from a federal court of all proceeds received from the sale of products deemed misbranded or adulterated.
The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, enforces the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTCA, and related regulations, which govern the advertising associated with the promotion and sale of dietary supplements to prevent misleading or deceptive claims.
In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against food and dietary supplement companies for making false or misleading advertising claims and for failing to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising. These enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties and/or restitution by the companies involved. The FTC also regulates other aspects of consumer purchases including, but not limited to, promotional offers of savings compared policies, telemarketing, continuity plans, and "free" offers.
We are also subject to regulation under various state, local and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements. California has a law called the "Consumers Legal Remedies Act" (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1750 et seq) that allows private parties to assert a class action claim for false or deceptive advertising. It is typically asserted in combination with claims for false advertising and unfair competition under the California Business and Professions Code. California law firms specializing in this type of consumer class action claims have recently been targeting dietary supplement makers and sellers of products sold in California, claiming injury based on the products' failure to deliver results as claimed in product labeling and promotion.
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service enforces federal laws governing fraudulent use of the mail. Regulation of certain aspects of the dietary supplement business at the federal level is also governed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, (e.g., concerning the presence of adulterated substances, such as toxic levels of lead or iron, that render products unsafe for consumption and require a CPSC ordered recall), the Department of Agriculture (e.g., for products that are intended for ingestion as dietary supplements for animals) and the Environmental Protection Agency (e.g., in the methods of disposal used for certain dietary ingredients, such as colloidal silver).
Government regulations in foreign countries may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of certain of our products. We expect that compliance with such foreign governmental regulations will generally be the responsibility of our distributors in those countries and we expect these distributors will be independent contractors that we do not control.
In addition, from time to time in the future, we may become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA, the FTC, or by other federal, state, local or foreign regulatory authorities, to the repeal of laws or regulations that we generally consider favorable, or to more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. We are not able to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, repeals or interpretations, and we cannot predict what effect additional governmental regulation, if and when it occurs, would have on our business in the future. Such developments could, however, require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, additional personnel or other new requirements. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Europe
The European Union, or EU, is responsible for the development of legislation governing foods, nutritional supplements, and medicines sold in Europe. Member States of the EU, or Member States, are authorized to develop local legislation governing these products, provided such legislation is not more restrictive than the legislation promulgated by the EU. Member States are responsible for enforcement of the applicable legislation. In 2002, the EU established a process for Member States to bring this regulating legislation in line with a published directive of the EU, which addressed the labeling and marketing of vitamins and minerals, what nutrients are permitted or not permitted and other packaging requirements. In 2004, the EU established standards for the manufacture and marketing of herbal medicines with the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive. This 
16

requires, among other things, manufacturers of herbal medicinal products to comply with Pharmaceutical Group Standards, and only requires proof of safety, not efficacy.
In 2006, the EU adopted its Commission Directive 2006/37/EC, amending its Directive 2002/46/EC. Under the amended directive, only nutrients listed in Annex II, or approved by subsequent order of the EU, may be lawfully sold in Member States. The EU also regulates labels, labeling, and advertising associated with the promotion and sale of dietary supplements in Europe. These regulations may make it unlawful for us to sell in Europe certain products lawfully labeled and sold in the United States.
In the United Kingdom, the principal governing legislation is the Food Safety Act of 1990, or FSA (governing safety of food products) and the Medicines Act of 1968 (governing licensing and sale of medicine). Further guidance is provided by numerous Statutory Instruments addressing the formulation, purity, packaging, advertising and labeling of such products. Medicinal products are regulated and enforced by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), an agency of the Department of Health. The MHRA determines if an herbal remedy is medicinal by virtue of its "presentation" or "function." Food products are regulated by the Food Standard Agency (FSA), which reports to the Department of Health and to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Vitamin and mineral supplements and soup products with herbal ingredients are generally considered food supplements and are subject to the purview of the FSA. Additional legislative standards have been adopted in the other EU countries, typically similar in scope to the UK. The regulatory scheme in Canada is similar but not identical to that of the United States concerning medicines and healthcare products or material health products and is regulated by Health Canada.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement for Drug Products
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any drug products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. In addition, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will continue to experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative and regulatory initiatives. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our drug products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. If these third-party payors do not consider our drug products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. For example, in the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and 
17

control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been, and continue to be, a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
In March 2010, then President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, a sweeping law intended to, among other things, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the ACA revises the definition of "average manufacturer price" for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective. Further, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Most recently, in January, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. The Budget Resolution is not a law; however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of repeal legislation. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, on August 2, 2011, then President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.
Moreover, the recently enacted Drug Supply Chain Security Act, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, which is being phased in over several years. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. 
18

We expect that healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenue. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, various activities, including but not limited to clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws, each as amended. Failure to comply with such requirements could potentially result in substantial penalties to us. Even if we structure our programs with the intent of compliance with such laws, there can be no certainty that we would not need to defend against enforcement or litigation, in light of the fact that there is significant enforcement interest in pharmaceutical companies in the United States, and some of the applicable laws are quite broad in scope.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of co-payments or deductibles, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the ACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below).
Additionally, the federal civil monetary penalties statute imposes fines against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
The federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, impose liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the civil False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the civil False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on, for example, the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper promotion of off-label uses (i.e., uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug's label), and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our business activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-
19

party reimbursement of our future products, and the sale and marketing of our future products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. The cost of defending any such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance.
Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several additional federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal laws mentioned above, and some of these state laws are broader in scope and may apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform federal standards for certain "covered entities" (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included expansion of HIPAA's privacy and security standards under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, referred to as HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to "business associates" — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking is performed properly, and some of these laws result in the public disclosure of various types of payments and relationships.
Several states have also enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. Additionally, in order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain.
Many of our current as well as possible future activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We must also comply with laws that require clinical trial registration and reporting of clinical trial results on the publicly available clinical trial databank maintained by the National Institutes 
20

of Health at www.ClinicalTrials.gov. We are subject to various environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances. From time to time, and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous materials.
Because of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant administrative, criminal and civil penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private "qui tam" actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country's national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country's requirements, the clinical trial described in that CTA may proceed.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the ICH GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. In the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, a body of the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA; and the National MA, which is issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only authorized marketing in that Member State's national territory and not the EEA as a whole.
The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. The National MA is for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member state, or RMS. If the RMS proposes to authorize the product, and the other Member States do not raise objections, the product is granted a national MA in all the Member States where the authorization was sought. Before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
In addition, we may be subject to certain health regulatory laws in the foreign countries in which we conduct business. For instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to 
21

healthcare professionals. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
