Item 1. Business
Introduction 



Purple’s mission is to help “every body” feel and live better through innovative comfort solutions.



We are a digitally-native vertical brand founded on comfort product innovation with premium offerings. We design and manufacture a variety of innovative, branded and premium comfort products, including mattresses, pillows, cushions, frames, sheets and more. Our products are the result of decades of innovation and investment in proprietary and patented comfort technologies and the development of our own manufacturing processes. Our proprietary gel technology, Hyper-Elastic Polymer®, known as the Purple Grid®, underpins many of our comfort products and provides a range of benefits that differentiate our offerings from other competitors’ products. Specially engineered for total pressure relief and unwavering support, Purple’s patented grid technology has been used and tested rigorously within medical and consumer applications for over 30 years. Originally designed for use in hospital beds and wheelchairs, we adapted this unique pressure-relieving material for our mattresses.



We market and sell our products through direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) online channels, Company showrooms and retail brick-and-mortar wholesale partners.



The foundation of our business is core competencies in design, development and manufacturing. Decades of accumulated knowledge enable us to create all aspects of our innovative products, including fundamental comfort technologies and machines and processes necessary to bring them to market. We have integrated our operations to include research and development, marketing and manufacturing, resulting in an ability to rapidly test, learn, adapt and scale our product offerings. In order to solve complex manufacturing challenges such as large-format injection molding of our Purple Grid, we designed and produced our own manufacturing equipment including our proprietary and patented Mattress Max™ machinery. These were and still are fully customized machines unique to Purple that can handle both our size and scale requirements. We believe our combination of patents and intellectual property, proprietary and patented manufacturing equipment, production processes and decades of acquired knowledge create an advantage over our competitors who rely on commoditized materials, such as foam and outsourced manufacturing.



In addition to developing transformative, differentiated products and technologies, we have built a brand that has high customer engagement and avid online advocates. We have an experienced digital marketing team, providing efficient customer acquisition and brand affinity. Our digital marketing strategy enables us to market our full product suite to customers, generate frequent interactions online and drive traffic to all channels offering our products.



We have capitalized on the DTC macro trend that is transforming the bedding industry. To complement our DTC channel, we have developed multiple wholesale relationships with best-in-class retailers in the furniture, mattress specialty, home décor, and department store spaces. We believe our distinctly differentiated products, marketing strategies, manufacturing capabilities, unique branding and proprietary technologies position us to continue to drive our growth in comfort products. For 2020, our DTC sales channel, which includes online and Company showrooms, accounted for 74.8% of our net revenue and wholesale accounted for 25.2% of net revenue, while sales of bedding accounted for 92.2% of our net revenue and other products accounted for 7.8%.



In July 2020, Purple entered into a lease for a new facility in McDonough, Georgia with plans to grow our manufacturing footprint and serve our customers in the eastern U.S. Purple began operations in the new facility on March 3, 2021 and for the remainder of 2021 will ramp up to planned capacity of four Mattress Max machines. We intend to hire over 360 employees to fully staff the facility. We also grew our DTC efforts by adding four Company showrooms in 2020, making a total of nine Company showroom locations in cities across the U.S. We anticipate opening additional Company showrooms throughout 2021.

Industry and Competition 



Our portfolio of products is driven by our commitment to innovating real comfort solutions that meaningfully help “every body” feel and live better. Whether it’s getting a better night’s rest or elevating the work from home experience, we design and manufacture truly innovative, differentiated products that put our customer’s comfort first.
Bedding 



The bedding category encompasses a variety of products including mattresses, pillows, bases, foundations, sheets, mattress protectors, blankets and duvets. Meaningful innovation in sleep products has remained stagnant and limited over the last 150 years. Coil spring mattresses and memory foam, two of the primary materials underpinning mattress technology today, were invented in the 1860’s and 1990’s. Latex, water and air mattresses followed, emerging in the latter part of the 20th century. Since these early inventions, the mattress industry has remained complacent with little meaningful innovation, until the introduction of the Purple Grid. Our Purple Grid, made from our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer, represents a meaningful innovation in pressure relief, temperature neutrality, responsiveness, durability and limited motion transfer. The Purple Grid solves problems that regular mattresses create and has proven that material innovations can have a positive impact on sleep.



The market for bedding products is rapidly growing and currently undergoing a fundamental transformation with the rise of e-commerce and DTC distribution. The U.S. mattress industry is predominantly comprised of vendors that rely on retail distribution as well as a growing number of DTC retailers. With COVID-19's impact on brick-and-mortar retail over the past year, our manufacturing capabilities paired with our strategic mix of showrooms, e-commerce and third-party retailers, has allowed us to gain share and be a leader in the home category.



Over the past several years, growth of the DTC market exceeded that of the broader industry. The majority of this growth has been seen by new mattress companies that offer convenience, free shipping and returns, and low prices, while leveraging third-party manufacturing and distribution. Materials used by online mattress retailers include layers of foam cushioning that are assembled, compressed and folded into a box for distribution. This market is highly fragmented, commoditized and competitive, with customer purchase decisions based primarily on price. Prior to Purple, there has been little recent success disrupting the premium market, where the majority of category revenue and profit is realized. Competitors in the premium market include Tempur Sealy and Sleep Number.



While e-commerce home goods purchases have increased over the past year, traditional brick-and-mortar retailers command a significant part of the market for bedding products. This part of the retail market is also highly fragmented and competitive. The leading brick-and-mortar specialty mattress retailers in the United States and Canada are, respectively, Mattress Firm and Sleep Country Canada, both of which Purple has significant partnerships. These national retailers compete with both regional and local retailers as well as furniture and department stores. Purple has also expanded into many of these regional furniture retailers.



Across these channels, some key factors that impact competition in our industry include product features, reliable logistics and manufacturing capabilities, marketing efficiency, brand recognition and reputation, expertise of sales and after-market support, pace of innovation and product roadmap, price of products and services, financial stability and ability to invest in innovation.



Seat Cushions and Other 



Our seat cushions and other category consist of products that can be purchased independent of furniture, such as pet beds. To the best of our knowledge, there are no independent market analyses that define the size and growth of this category. It is important to note that there is a significantly larger market for cushioning technology embedded within furniture, including chairs and sofas as well as seats found in transportation and other categories requiring seating solutions. We believe this is a substantial market opportunity that we could pursue with either branded product offerings or through branded original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partnerships to embed our technology. We saw a significant increase of revenue in this category in 2020, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic with more people working from home.

What Makes Purple Different? 



We believe we have a particular set of competitive strengths that differentiate and position us for continued success:




● | History of innovation that produced new comfort technology—We are a company built on innovation and licensing, with more than 30 years of expertise in comfort innovation. Purple is founded upon decades of history developing innovative comfort solutions, including the invention of our proprietary and patented Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology. Our breakthrough mattress represents what we believe to be the first substantive innovation in the mattress industry since the introduction of memory foam in 1992. We believe that the unique properties of the Purple Grid enable several improvements to existing bedding that are not addressed by foam, spring and air mattresses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pressure Relief—The Purple Grid is designed around the science of column buckling which enables our mattresses to be both firm and soft. The Purple Grid offers support across the body’s larger surface areas, such as the back, while providing pressure relief at local areas or points of pressure, such as the hips and shoulders. We believe Purple’s founders were the first to leverage this technology in mattresses after its success in licensing its proprietary Purple Grid to medical manufacturers for use in wheelchairs, critical care beds and to this day, hospital beds. The resulting feel is often described as buoyant, such as floating on water. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Temperature Neutral—The Hyper-Elastic Polymer material itself is temperature neutral, with the surface of the Purple Grid comprised mostly of air, made from thousands of open-air channels. The channels allow for high airflow and dissipation of heat and vapor. This is the opposite of foam beds, which absorb heat from the body and then radiate the heat back, constantly increasing the temperature. The Purple Grid allows for continual sleeping without waking up hot.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Responsive—Unlike memory foam, which compresses, gets hard and then takes time to recoil, the Purple Grid is instantly responsive to the body as it moves. It will immediately flex to support your position and spring back into place as you readjust during the night.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Durable—Hyper-Elastic Polymer material is a highly durable gel that we believe outlasts most foams by two to three times. The Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology also has numerous applications beyond mattress products including seat cushions, pillows, pet beds and beyond. The development of the Hyper-Elastic Polymer technology is only one of numerous innovations we have developed to produce a range of unique and effective comfort products across the bedding, seat cushion and other categories. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proprietary technologies and manufacturing expertise provide a significant competitive advantage—We believe the combination of patent protection, proprietary manufacturing equipment and decades of accumulated knowledge creates a competitive advantage through barriers to imitation. We have over 150 granted or pending patents and over 250 patent filings that cover current and future products as well as proprietary manufacturing equipment we have designed and fabricated. In addition to intellectual property protection of key products and manufacturing capabilities, our team has decades of experience and unique insights derived from inventing and refining proprietary comfort technologies, machines and products. Our Mattress Max machine, designed and built by Purple, allows for large-format injection molding of gels at scale. Not commercially available outside of Purple, this machine is essential in producing our proprietary products efficiently and at scale. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growing a brand with a passionate following—Our brand mirrors our passion for uncompromising performance, quality and durability, and with effective use of education and viral marketing, has been able to cut-through the competitive noise. We believe our digital marketing strategy has achieved a level of engagement few competitors match, including a series of videos that have been seen more than 4.4 billion times across Facebook and YouTube. Our brand has extended beyond awareness of individual products and we have successfully marketed our full suite of products to customers using our DTC strategy. We believe customer satisfaction of our product has continued to drive “word of mouth” as the most common reason customers learn about our products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Balanced, omni-channel distribution strategy—We have sought opportunities to expand brand awareness in brick-and-mortar retailers where our beds can be displayed. This is a very different approach from most bed-in-a-box players who seek traditional Consumer Packaged Goods distribution, e.g., boxes on shelves. Our goal is to support the customer wherever and however they want to learn, try, and buy. Whether wholesale, Purple-owned showrooms, or DTC channels, we are a leader in the bedding market. Our flexible return policies and aggressive expansion of wholesale doors and showrooms allow for more of our targeted customers to feel and experience our products throughout the purchase process. In our wholesale channel, we sell most of our products through select national and regional retailers as well as a variety of independent retail partners throughout the United States and Canada. As a result, we believe we are driving accelerated growth in the bedding market as compared to the traditional retail bedding industry.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Vertical integration enables nimble design, development and execution—We design and develop our cushioning products in-house and we have extensive research and development capabilities led by a team of engineers, industrial designers and marketing specialists. The ability to develop and test products in this manner enables us to not only prototype and deploy new ideas, but also design and develop corresponding manufacturing equipment and processes. In addition, we continuously refine our production methods to improve product quality and enhance efficiency. The resulting real-time feedback cycle is a key differentiator compared to other competitors that outsource many of these functions and lack an integrated approach.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategies 




● | Further direct-to-consumer growth and penetration—We believe that we are well positioned to leverage our brand, leading product portfolio, vertical integration and strong marketing capabilities to continue to attract new customers via our DTC channel. Our e-commerce site was originally built for only a few products and we are investing in redesigning and re-platforming as our assortment has grown. We have additionally invested in substantially expanding our contact center, enabling live voice, chat and messaging with our sales associates which has driven higher customer satisfaction, higher average order value, and higher conversion. Continued successful execution within the DTC channel represents a significant growth opportunity. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expanded omni-channel distribution and retail relationships—Expanding retail distribution of our products via new and existing arrangements represents an opportunity to tap into the large brick-and-mortar category of the cushioning market. We continue to have discussions with new retail partners to expand our wholesale footprint. In addition, we currently operate nine Company showrooms in cities across the U.S. where consumers can experience our brand, learn and engage with our technology, and purchase our products. We anticipate continual expansion of our showrooms as we optimize the format.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Existing product innovation—We have a rich history of product innovation and have developed core competencies in design, prototyping and manufacturing. This vertical integration enables us to continuously refine our existing products and manufacturing processes, as well as introduce new offerings, with the potential to attract new customers and drive repeat sales.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | New product launches—We have a pipeline of future products we are developing. We are constantly exploring new technologies and ways to expand the benefits of our technologies through new product offerings. This includes innovations in mattresses beyond the Purple Grid, an expanded assortment based on the Harmony PillowTM that includes new patent-pending technology, other assortment expansion and new products in cushioning and additional categories. In 2020, we added a children’s line of products, enabling us to sell to this underserved demographic and providing an additional opportunity to enter the home.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additional capacity—In July 2020, we entered into a lease for a new facility in McDonough, Georgia with plans to grow our manufacturing footprint and serve our customers in the eastern U.S. The new leased facility includes approximately 520,000 square feet that we anticipate will significantly expand our domestic manufacturing capacity over time. Our first manufacturing plant outside of Utah, we believe this new location will enable us to serve our customers on the east coast more efficiently. We began operations at the new facility on March 3, 2021 and for the remainder of 2021 will ramp up to planned capacity of four Mattress Max machines. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | International expansion—We believe there is a substantial opportunity for international expansion, and we expect to find new opportunities as we expand into foreign markets. We entered Canada in Q4 2020 via the wholesale retailer Sleep Country Canada and we plan to expand in other foreign markets in the future. We believe that our differentiated products, multi-channel distribution strategy, manufacturing capabilities, vertical integration and marketing expertise will enable us to successfully enter new markets. We are exploring opportunities for international expansion in areas such as marketing, manufacturing and distribution, as well as increasing franchise and wholesale partners.

Technology 



Technology is key to our unique position within the comfort industry. With our proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer material used in the Purple Grid, we have introduced the first major innovation to the mattress category in decades. Mattresses from our competitors are typically manufactured using one or more layers of springs, standard polyurethane foam, memory foam, air chambers or latex foam. These technologies have existed for decades and are undifferentiated from competitors within their product type.
Proprietary Technologies 



The Purple innovation team, through their scientific journey to get to the root causes of pressure sores, designed the Hyper-Elastic Polymer material, Purple Grid structure, and other proprietary comfort technologies in order to improve the lives of “every body.” Each different cushioning product line requires unique molding techniques.



Our Hyper-Elastic Polymer material is non-toxic and hypoallergenic. This proprietary material is also durable and will not develop body impressions (compression set) from use over time. It is elastic and can stretch up to 15 times its original size and return without losing its shape. It sleeps and sits temperature-neutral and has good ventilation to inhibit moisture build-up.



Our Purple Grid structure made with Hyper-Elastic Polymer material is both soft and supportive. While the columns in this structure provide support where it is needed, they also buckle where it is needed to reduce pressure by allowing shoulders and hips to sink into the cushion with reduced force pushing back on those areas of the body unlike other cushion technologies. The soft and flexible columns also return to their original position as forces lessen and are capable of immediately providing support.



Proprietary Machinery 



Internally designed, developed and built, our Mattress Max machines are the only machines able to mold our Hyper-Elastic Polymer material into large-format king-sized mattresses at scale. We have modified other molding machines to manufacture additional products containing Hyper-Elastic Polymer material, such as pillows and seat cushions. The process of molding our Hyper-Elastic Polymer material using our Mattress Max machinery is proprietary, patent-protected and complex, requiring specific knowledge and expertise to successfully execute manufacturing. We have vertically integrated with our own machine shop with mechanics and engineers at each of our factories to maintain our machines and other equipment. Furthermore, we have extensive in-house fabrication capabilities, which enable us to design, manufacture, install and maintain new equipment as well as optimize the performance and efficiency of our existing machinery based on real-time insights gained from our vertically integrated operations.
Marketing 



We have developed a brand that resonates with consumers. Our marketing efforts are focused on attracting, acquiring and retaining customers, primarily through digital campaigns and online advertising. Our campaigns are unique and memorable featuring product demonstrations that have been able to harness viral efficiencies associated with social media. As a result, we have created a brand with a loyal audience that frequently interacts with our content. This enables us to increase interaction with customers to drive additional product sales across our portfolio of offerings. The success we have achieved through these social marketing campaigns has been key in our branding and awareness. Our digital marketing team has expertise across a broad range of marketing capabilities including audience segmentation, video production, communication and targeting. We also utilize television, radio and print mediums to create brand and product awareness.
Our Sales Channels 



Historically, the majority of our sales have been through our DTC e-commerce platform; however, our wholesale channel continues to grow rapidly. We have relationships with a growing number of brick-and-mortar retailers, and we are expanding our national footprint of wholesale partners. We have also opened several Purple-owned showrooms across the U.S. with plans to open more in 2021.



Direct-to-Consumer Channel 



E-commerce is our primary distribution channel. We have benefitted from the rapid growth of the DTC mattress industry in addition to our differentiated product offering and unique marketing campaigns. We expect the DTC mattress industry to continue to grow as consumer confidence in online shopping increases. We sell directly to consumers through our website and our growing customer contact center. We help customers easily engage in relevant content, research our solutions, transact online and find support. We believe our online experience expands our brand and connections with consumers, enabling deeper awareness, engagement and brand loyalty. We believe our 100-night trial along with free shipping and free returns provides confidence to consumers in buying a mattress.




6







We operate nine Company showrooms in cities across the U.S. where consumers can experience our brand, learn and engage with our technology and purchase our products. We plan to continue expanding our showroom footprint across the United States with additional showrooms in 2021 and beyond.



Wholesale Channel 



We sell our assortment of products through brick-and-mortar wholesale partners. We began selling mattresses and bedding products through our largest wholesale partner, Mattress Firm, in November 2017. We have expanded the number of retail doors to more than 2,200, where our mattresses and bedding products are sold, and now sell mattresses through Bed Bath & Beyond, Big Sandy, Bloomingdale's, City Furniture, Furniture Row, HOM Furniture, Macy's, Mathis Brothers, Mattress Firm, Raymour & Flanigan, Rooms To Go, Sleep County Canada and Steinhafels. We typically have three to four mattress offerings on the floor. Sales associates have been trained and are effective in educating consumers regarding our unique benefits as well as shifting the mix upward to our more premium and higher-margin mattresses. We expect to continue expanding brick-and-mortar wholesale partners to give our customers the opportunity to feel the difference of the Purple Grid for themselves.
Operations 



Factories, Supply Chain and Manufacturing 



We operate factories in Alpine, Utah, Grantsville, Utah and McDonough, Georgia, which manufacture and distribute Purple products. Our two factories in Utah have a total of 667,000 square-feet (15 acres under roof), including approximately 574,000 square-feet at our Grantsville factory and another 93,000 square-feet at our Alpine factory. Our factory in McDonough, Georgia provides 520,000 square feet to service our customers on the east coast. We began operations at the new facility on March 3, 2021 and for the remainder of 2021 will ramp up to planned capacity of four Mattress Max machines.

We have relationships with multiple suppliers for our outsourced products and components. These suppliers may be interchanged in order to maintain quality, cost and delivery expectations.



Environmental and Governmental Regulation 



We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign consumer protection and other laws regulating the bedding industry. These regulations vary among the states and countries in which we do and intend to do business. In the United States, we are subject to regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies that have authority to regulate our operations. Included in these regulations are laws restricting the generation, emission, treatment, storage and disposal of materials, substances and waste. We are subject to the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Our mattress products are also subject to fire-retardant standards developed by the State of California, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and other jurisdictions where we sell these products.



As a retailer of bedding and cushioning products, we are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to retailers generally, including those regulations governing the marketing and sale of our products and the operation of our e-commerce activities. We are also subject to import and export laws to the extent our products and their component parts cross international boundaries. Many of these regulations are consumer-focused and pertain to safety, truth-in-advertising, promotional offers, privacy, “do not call/mail” requirements, warranty disclosure, delivery timing requirements and similar requirements.



It is our policy and practice to comply with all applicable U.S. and foreign laws. We have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures necessary to comply with these laws. These expenditures have been immaterial to our financial results. We have not suffered a material adverse effect from non-compliance with federal, state, local or foreign legislation, but there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such legislation in the future.

Human Capital



Employees 



Our most valuable asset at Purple is our people and their learned institutional knowledge. We are mission-driven by our commitment to innovating real comfort solutions that meaningfully help “every body” feel and live better. We are a product innovation company at our core.



As of March 8, 2021, we have approximately 1,600 employees engaged in manufacturing, research and development, general corporate functions and in our retail showrooms. Due to the increased demand of our products throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we increased our headcount by over 800.



During 2020, the Company's top priority has been to take appropriate actions to protect the health and safety of our employees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our current employee population works primarily within our two factories in Utah and at our new headquarters in Lehi, Utah. However, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, employees who were working in office settings began working from home. We also identified new ways to work safely and effectively in our manufacturing areas by creating additional shifts, regularly cleaning common areas, wearing face masks and ensuring employees were practicing safe social distancing. We regularly engage labor contracting agencies and independent contractors to accelerate our progress and to provide support across various functions within our organization. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees.

Diversity and Inclusion



Purple is committed to fostering an environment that respects and encourages individual differences, diversity of thought, and talent. We strive to create a workplace where employees feel that their contributions are welcomed and valued, allowing them to fully engage their talents and training in their work, while generating personal satisfaction in their role within the Company. In September 2020, we hired our first Diversity and Inclusion Lead to help foster a more inclusive workplace. In November 2020, we expanded the number of women on our Board of Directors such that women now comprise 25% of our Board. We have begun the creation of several employee resource groups to offer insight into each department’s diversity growth and create allies that help us in talent development for underrepresented populations. In 2021, we will be establishing a comprehensive recruiting strategy that focuses on recruiting and retaining diverse candidates. In addition, we will be designing, training, and implementing programs focused on equity and belonging, developing an internal mentorship program to develop women and minorities within Purple into senior leadership positions and creating a brand strategy that raises brand awareness and customer acquisition in diverse markets.
Philanthropy



Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw the need to do our part in helping those who are less fortunate. We shifted our manufacturing processes to create relief beds that could be used in homeless shelters. This effort also proved to be beneficial for our manufacturing workers, giving them additional work during a time that was uncertain. Throughout the month of April 2020, we worked with Brands x Better—a coalition of like-minded businesses who looked to give back to the communities they serve—and donated 10% of net proceeds to this effort. We also partnered with the Precious Dreams Foundation to provide comfort items to children in foster care. On Giving Tuesday 2020 and on Random Acts of Kindness Day 2021, we donated 10% of net proceeds from our kid’s product collection to support this foundation. In addition, we sponsored Mattress Firm’s Give Back project in February 2021 for their Skate Like a Girl campaign, donating hundreds of skateboards to foster care facilities across the nation. For years, we also have donated products and time teaching high school students about manufacturing in the communities around our Grantsville, Utah facility in association with the Tooele Education Foundation, in addition to giving multiple scholarships to graduating seniors to attend both local trade schools and universities of their choice.
Ethical Culture



Finally, our Code of Ethics promotes an environment of integrity by requiring honest, ethical and fair conduct with a focus on conflicts of interest, compliance, deterrence and internal reporting. It also requires full, fair and accurate disclosure in public filings and communications. All employees are required to complete Code of Ethics training periodically.



Overall, we believe our culture, along with our internal tools and initiatives, enable us to effectively execute our human capital strategy. For discussion on the risks relating to our inability to attract and retain top-performing talent, please see section titled Risk Factors.



Our History 



Purple was created by two brothers that set out to revolutionize the comfort space. One in manufacturing and design, and the other an advanced aerospace scientist, the brothers embarked on a partnership in the early 1990s to put together a team to develop cushioning solutions for wheelchairs and medical beds. They later created what we call the Purple Grid—an elastomeric polymer that can stretch up to 15x its resting size and never lose shape or function. The Purple Grid has since been used in mattresses, seat cushions and pillows.



In August of 2020, Purple announced that co-founders Terry and Tony Pearce chose to retire from their positions as Co-Directors of Research & Development of Purple LLC and as directors on Purple Inc.’s Board. Today, Purple’s research and development teams are focused on creating innovative comfort solutions for all facets of life.
