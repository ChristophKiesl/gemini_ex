Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on pioneering a new approach to treat complex diseases and improve health using endogenous metabolic modulator, or EMM, compositions. Our product candidates are comprised of multiple EMMs that are engineered in distinct combinations and ratios with the goal of simultaneously impacting multiple biological pathways. Our pipeline includes our lead therapeutic candidates: AXA1665 for the reduction in risk of recurrent overt hepatic encephalopathy, or OHE, and AXA1125 for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. 
Using our development platform, we have efficiently designed product candidates that are comprised of amino acids and their derivatives, which have a general history of safe use. The orally administered EMM compositions that we have tested to date have shown the potential to generate multifactorial effects in our initial Clinical Studies.
Once we design a product candidate, we decide whether to initially evaluate it in (i) a non-investigational new drug application, or non-IND, Institutional Review Board, or IRB, approved clinical study under U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, regulations and guidance supporting research with food (as noted herein, the term food also includes dietary supplements) or (ii) in a clinical trial under an IND. In this Annual Report, we refer to our non-IND Clinical Studies as “Clinical Studies” and our planned IND-enabled Clinical Trials as “Clinical Trials.” A Clinical Study allows us to evaluate a product candidate’s safety, tolerability and permissible secondary endpoints (e.g. impact on normal structures and functions of the body, including metabolic pathways) before we determine the next steps in its development. 
In 2020, we completed and reported top-line data from our latest Clinical Studies of AXA1665 and AXA1125:
•In AXA1665-002, AXA1665 was well tolerated in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic insufficiency and no significant safety signals were observed in patients dosed with this candidate. Additionally, dose dependent changes were noted across measures of amino acid metabolism and neurocognition over 12 weeks. These included statistically significant (p <0.05) improvements in the Fischer Ratio and the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) in the AXA1665 high dose arm versus placebo. Additionally, clinically relevant trends were seen in certain measures of nitrogen/ammonia handling and physical function in the AXA1665 arms versus placebo. Based on AXA1665’s differentiated, multi-targeted design and these data, we believe this candidate holds the potential to reduce OHE events and improve the quality of life for cirrhotic patients.
•In AXA1125-003, AXA1125 was well tolerated in subjects with presumed NASH, and no significant safety signals were observed in patients dosed with this candidate. Additionally, sustained reductions versus placebo over 16 weeks were noted across key biomarkers of metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis, including MRI-PDFF, HOMA-IR, ALT and ProC3. Among subjects with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the study (~40% of the overall study cohort), reductions in most biomarkers tended to be of a higher magnitude compared to the overall cohort. Based on AXA1125’s multi-targeted design and these data, we believe this candidate holds the potential to serve as a first-line NASH monotherapy for both adult and pediatric patients and be used in combination with other agents if required.
In the second quarter of 2021, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 Clinical Trial of AXA1665 and a Phase 2b Clinical Trial of AXA1125.

About Endogenous Metabolic Modulators (EMMs)
EMMs encompass a broad set of molecular families, including amino acids, bile acids, other intermediary substrates and hormones. Together, these molecules can serve as master regulators and signaling agents, driving multiple pathways to elicit multifactorial effects that integrate basic cellular functioning to impact fundamental biologies. Such biologies include cellular bioenergetics (e.g., tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain), nutrient handling (e.g., de novo lipogenesis, or metabolic formation of fat, gluconeogenesis, or the generation of glucose from certain non-carbohydrate carbon substrates, and proteogenesis, or protein formation), nutrient sensing via master regulators (e.g., via mammalian target of rapamycin, or mTOR, 5' AMP-activated protein kinase, or AMPK, fibroblast growth factor 21, or FGF21, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, or PPARs), immune response and inflammation, reactive oxygen response, vascular function, neurotransmitter signaling, tissue repair, and autophagy.
Metabolic dysregulation results from a disruption in human homeostasis that is core to optimal functioning and consequently, health. Maintenance of this equilibrium requires an orchestration of multiple metabolic pathways and inter-organ signaling, evolved over billions of years, and is carried out by signaling intermediates and endogenous mediators. EMMs are a critical subset of such endogenous elements that regulate metabolic function.
The loss of homeostasis can be manifested in many conditions and complex diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, or T2D, NASH and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, OHE, and muscle atrophy. As an example, dysregulation in the metabolic processes and pathways controlled by the liver, such as de novo lipogenesis or gluconeogenesis can lead to an inability to adequately handle fuel substrates such as fats or carbohydrates. This ultimately results in fatty liver, insulin resistance and buildup of toxic waste products, such as ammonia. Similarly, a complex cascade of fuel dysregulation within skeletal muscles, a key organ involved in glucose disposal and utilization of amino acids as substrates for protein synthesis, can result in insulin resistance, intramuscular fat infiltration and muscle mass loss, thus decreasing muscle function. Muscle mass loss, or sarcopenia, is increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of end organ function linked to clinical outcomes and overall survival, such as in end-stage liver disease (cirrhotic sarcopenia) or in end-stage renal disease (uremic sarcopenia).
Consequently, restoring homeostasis and healthy metabolism benefits from a multifactorial approach. We believe that our EMM compositions have the potential to address systems-wide metabolic dysregulation to restore, improve, support and/or maintain homeostasis. In recent decades, extensive data have been generated demonstrating amino acids’ role as fundamental building blocks of life. More recently, their roles in nutrient sensing and cellular signaling have been elucidated not only with individual amino acids, such as a leucine sensor on mTOR, but also in combinations. 
In addition to their known biological impacts, amino acids also have a long history of general safe use. As a result, we believe our EMM compositions will have limited off-target effects in humans as compared to traditional pharmaceutical agents. Each of the above factors provide the potential to bring about a transformation in treating complex diseases and/or supporting health. 
Our EMM Composition Design Approach
Our development platform allows us to efficiently design and test EMM compositions that simultaneously target multiple biologies and metabolic pathways. This platform integrates advanced analytics of metabolic regulation and dysregulation to interrogate data in our proprietary databases, which we refer to as Axcella Database, or AxcellaDB, and Axcella Knowledge Base, or AxcellaKB. Our human primary cell systems also directly test the multiple biologies that are particularly disease-related and drive metabolic dysregulation. All of this is supported by what we believe to be the world’s leading EMM safety database. The data and learnings generated through this process further inform our design methodology, increasing our development platform's efficiency for the development of subsequent product candidates.
Table of Contents

AxcellaDB, our proprietary database, synthesizes a combination of data from published scientific and medical literature, our in vitro models, and our human Clinical Studies. Through advanced analytics, we investigate novel, causal connections among EMMs, biology, health and disease. We believe this enables us to take a systems biology approach to product candidate discovery and development. Ultimately, we envision utilizing AxcellaKB and its internal machine learning capabilities to identify EMM compositions, predict their effects on biology and identify new target areas for our platform.
Rapid Advancement into Human Clinical Trials
Nonclinical Research
We test EMM compositions and hypothesized synergies in normal and disease-specific human primary cell models. We conduct our model systems in environments that aim to simulate physiological levels of biofluids and nutrients. These models include multiple cell types that we use to deconstruct dysregulated metabolism or disease conditions to isolate effects of EMM compositions on subsets of metabolic pathways. The throughput of these models enables us to test product candidates as well as combinations of the individual constituents to identify and better understand their interactions.
Pharmacokinetic, or PK, literature, experiments and modeling inform our EMM compositions (i.e. amounts and ratios). We are able to evaluate EMM plasma exposure, supra-physiological exposures, windows of exposure administration amounts, the characterization of critical PK behaviors across molecule classes, and the implications of physiological compartmental distribution. We believe these data can be used to refine product candidate designs.
Clinical Development Approach 
Once a product candidate is designed, we then decide whether to evaluate the candidate in a Clinical Study or under a Clinical Trial. We conduct our Clinical Studies under the FDA's September 2013 Guidance for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs entitled "Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) — Determining Whether Human Research Studies Can Be Conducted Without an IND," which we believe allows for Clinical Studies to be conducted to assess a food product’s safety, tolerability and effect on normal structures or functions in humans in healthy and diseased subjects. Our Clinical Studies include a substantial number of biomarkers that may inform biologies relevant to the healthy structures and functions of the body but are not designed or intended to evaluate a product candidate’s ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease or other health condition. 
To date, we have initially conducted clinical investigations of our product candidates in Clinical Studies. Based on initial Clinical Study results for AXA1665 and AXA1125, our two lead candidates, we decided to pursue their development as therapeutic candidates via Clinical Trials under INDs. These Clinical Trials will, therefore, evaluate each product candidate’s ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent targeted diseases. 
On average, it has been estimated that it takes seven or more years for a therapeutic to progress from product candidate design to Phase 2 development. Our approach has enabled us to rapidly design and investigate our product candidates, providing meaningful insights into their safety, tolerability and biological activity in diseased human subjects. Aided by the data we have generated to date and multiple regulatory interactions regarding our lead product candidates, the FDA cleared our IND for AXA1665 in early 2021, enabling us to proceed directly into a planned Phase 2 clinical trial. We also expect to enter a Phase 2b Clinical Trial of AXA1125 following an IND clearance for this candidate. We believe the achievement of these milestones approximately four years after finalizing the design of our lead product candidates validates the speed and efficiency of our approach.

Our Pipeline
The following chart summarizes our current pipeline and planned next development steps:
1. Initial Clinical Studies refers to Non-IND Clinical Studies initiated prior to making a decision to develop a product candidate as a therapeutic. 
2. Planned Clinical Trials, contingent upon allowance by the FDA. Timing based on current expectations and subject to risks, including those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
3. Indication expected to be reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy recurrence.
AXA1665 for the Reduction in Risk of Overt Hepatic Encephalopathy (OHE) Recurrence
AXA1665 is currently being developed as a product candidate for the reduction in risk of OHE recurrence in adult patients with liver cirrhosis. In early 2021, we announced that our IND for this candidate was cleared by the FDA, enabling us to proceed directly into a Phase 2 Clinical Trial that we expect to initiate in the second quarter of 2021. Based on AXA1665’s differentiated, multi-targeted design and data gathered to date, Axcella believes this candidate holds the potential to reduce OHE events and improve the quality of life for cirrhotic patients.
About OHE and Cirrhosis
Long-term damage to the liver from various causes, such as alcohol, hepatitis B or C viral infections, NASH or autoimmune hepatitis, can lead to permanent scarring, a condition called cirrhosis. Prevalence of cirrhosis in the United States is approximately 0.27%, corresponding to approximately 633,000 adults, of which 69% reported that they were unaware of having liver disease. Decompensated cirrhosis is a serious systemic disease with multi-organ dysfunction, resulting in a variety of significant complications, including HE, bacterial infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment and ascites, which is the build-up of excess fluid in the abdomen. Transition from compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis occurs at a rate of approximately 5% to 7% per year.
HE is one of the most common complications of cirrhosis with multiple contributing factors, such as amino acid imbalance, ammonia toxicity, muscle wasting, infections and constipation, all of which ultimately result in diminished brain function. Emerging data suggest that muscle mass and function are key independent factors associated with progression to and severity of HE. It is estimated that up to 60% of cirrhosis subjects have sarcopenia and, separately, 40% have HE symptoms. OHE refers to the presence of neurological abnormalities that are clinically apparent and do not require specialized psychometric testing. By contrast, minimal, or covert, HE is less severe and requires specialized testing for its diagnosis, including psychometric tests. OHE is well-established as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the cirrhotic population and is an area that continues to have unmet medical needs.
Furthermore, muscle depletion and muscle fat infiltration occurring during cirrhosis independently increase the risk of both overt and minimal HE with increased mortality. Decline in muscle mass can also hamper the alternative pathway of ammonia detoxification, and hyperammonemia may further worsen sarcopenia, generating a vicious cycle. The highly interdependent complications of cirrhosis, sarcopenia and HE constitute a significant disease burden and can have an impact on irreversible morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients. We estimate that approximately 63,000 to 130,000 individuals may be affected at any given time with both cirrhotic sarcopenia and OHE in the United States.

While there are three approved therapies for HE, there is still a need for additional HE treatment options, particularly those that have the potential to address the systemic complications of cirrhosis, including frailty.
Design of AXA1665
AXA1665 is a composition of eight amino acids and derivatives that is designed to target multiple metabolic pathways intersecting key organ systems (liver, muscle and gut) key to support and maintain liver health.

Underlying Biology | AXA1665 Design Objectives 
Plasma amino acid imbalance | Maximize proteogenesis and reduce systemic aromatic amino acids 
Dysregulated ammonia handling | Stimulate urea cycle function, intestinal and renal nitrogen metabolism, and induce intramuscular ammonia detoxification
Muscle wasting | Increase muscle protein synthesis by addressing metabolic demand and stimulating mTORC1 

Completed Clinical Study AXA1665-002
In 2020, Axcella completed its most recent Clinical Study of AXA1665, AXA1665-002. This was a 12-week (with a four-week follow-up) randomized, placebo-controlled Clinical Study to assess AXA1665’s safety, tolerability and impact on normal liver and muscle structures and functions in approximately 60 subjects with mild (Child A) and moderate (Child B) hepatic insufficiency.
1. Study design for AXA1665-002. This Clinical Study was initiated prior to determination of AXA1665 as a therapeutic product candidate.
Table of Contents

Key results from AXA1665-002 include:
•Safety/Tolerability: Both doses of AXA1665 were well tolerated, with no significant safety issues observed. Rates of adverse events (AEs) were low, mostly unrelated to study product and generally mild or moderate. There were four serious adverse events reported in the study and two deaths (one due to complications of COVID-19; one due to a myocardial infarction during the study run-in period prior to dosing), none of which were determined to be related to AXA1665.
•Neurocognitive Function: Positive, dose dependent trends were observed in the AXA1665 arms across all three psychometric tests: Stroop EncephalApp, critical flicker frequency, and psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES). In PHES, a highly specific assessment to diagnose minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE), a statistically significant (p <0.05) improvement of a clinically relevant magnitude was observed in the AXA1665 high dose arm versus the placebo. Additionally, the proportion of subjects achieving a clinically relevant threshold of PHES improvement was higher in the AXA1665 arms relative to placebo.
•Amino Acid Metabolism: A dose dependent and statistically significant (p <0.05) percentage increase from baseline in Fischer Ratio (FR; a measure of branched chain amino acids ÷ aromatic amino acids) was seen in the AXA1665 arms relative to placebo (low dose: 21%, high dose: 44%), which was sustained over 12 weeks. Observed changes in FR were accompanied by concomitant decreases in circulating aromatic amino acids (Phe and Tyr), which may suggest their incorporation into protein synthesis and an improved metabolic state. Published studies suggest that aromatic amino acids may contribute to impaired neurotransmission and have correlated lower FR with poor clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.
•Ammonia Handling: Despite the increased nitrogen load delivered via the amino acids in AXA1665, fasted plasma ammonia levels remained stable in the active arms over the 12-week dosing duration. In a subset of subjects with evidence of MHE at baseline as assessed by PHES, a mean reduction from baseline of approximately 7% in fasted plasma ammonia levels was observed in subjects receiving both doses of AXA1665 at week 12.
•Muscle Structure and Function: Key measures of muscle structure (e.g. lean mass) and function (e.g. gait speed, liver frailty index, or LFI) remained essentially stable in all groups from baseline to week 12. This observation may reflect the mild hepatic insufficiency and lack of overt sarcopenia in nearly all enrolled subjects at baseline. A higher proportion of subjects in the AXA1665 arms achieved a ≥0.3 absolute reduction in LFI (i.e. less frailty) versus placebo. Previous studies suggest that a ≥0.3 reduction in the LFI score may correlate with an improved ability to conduct activities of daily living in subjects with end-stage liver disease.

Design of our Planned Phase 2 Clinical Trial
The Phase 2 trial will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of AXA1665 in patients who have experienced at least one prior OHE event and have neurocognitive dysfunction at screening. Approximately 150 patients on either lactulose ± rifaximin (stratified by rifaximin use) will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive either 53.8 grams per day of AXA1665 or a calorie-matched placebo in three divided doses for 24 weeks, with a two-week safety follow-up period. 
The trial will be conducted globally with a primary endpoint assessing the proportion of subjects with ≥2 point increase in the psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES) after the 24-week treatment period. Secondary endpoints will include the total number of patients experiencing an OHE breakthrough event; time to first OHE breakthrough event, including time to hospitalization; changes in physical function; and patient reported outcomes. Other endpoints include ammonia, amino acid and inflammatory biomarkers.
AXA1125 for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)
AXA1125 is currently being developed as a product candidate for the treatment of NASH. Upon IND clearance from the FDA, we plan to proceed directly into a 48-week Phase 2b Clinical Trial enrolling adult subjects with biopsy confirmed NASH. This trial is expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2021. Based on AXA1125’s differentiated, multi-targeted design and data from our earlier Clinical Studies, we believe this candidate holds the potential to serve as a first-line NASH monotherapy for both adult and pediatric patients and be used in combination with other agents if required.
About NAFLD and NASH
While the pathologies of NAFLD and NASH manifest primarily in the liver, they are systemic diseases driven by multifactorial systemic dysregulation of pathways associated with metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. Dysfunctional lipid metabolism associated with insulin resistance and hepatocyte lipotoxicity increases liver cell death. Systemic and chronic inflammation at the cellular and cytokine level drives tissue damage and activates fibrogenic pathways. Activation of stellate cells then causes accumulation of collagen in the liver and leads to progressive fibrosis.
Table of Contents

NAFLD is one of the most common causes of liver disease in the United States. It is characterized by excess fat accumulation in the liver, typically resulting from obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. NAFLD in children is often more severe than in adults.
NAFLD can progress to NASH, which is characterized by necroinflammation and fibrosis, and may ultimately lead to life-threatening conditions such as cirrhosis or liver cancer, requiring liver transplant. According to the Global Liver Institute’s U.S. NASH Action Plan published in December 2020, up to 40 million people in the U.S. alone are living with NASH and approximately 10% of U.S. children are afflicted with this disease. Incidence is expected to continue increasing in parallel with the obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemics. This same report estimates that the lifetime costs for all U.S. NASH patients now exceeds $300 billion, reflecting the severity of this public health issue and its substantial burden on the overall healthcare system. 
A combination of dietary modifications and increased physical activity remains the standard of care for management of NAFLD and NASH. Currently, there are no approved drug therapies for NASH in the United States. 
To date, most compounds in development have focused on single key targets within metabolic, inflammation or fibrosis pathways. Few, however, have demonstrated statistical significance in the FDA’s approved endpoints, which are steatohepatitis resolution with no worsening of fibrosis or improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis. As a result, clinicians and biopharmaceutical companies are increasingly evaluating combination approaches to address the broad spectrum of the disease, improve response rates and expand the size of the treatable population. Significant challenges to this approach include the potential compounding of overlapping side effect profiles and high development and treatment costs.
Additionally, there are no approved pharmacologic treatments and few pipeline programs targeting pediatric NASH. Recommended treatment guidelines for this population currently center around lifestyle interventions.
Design of AXA1125
AXA1125 is a product candidate that contains six amino acids and derivatives. This product candidate was designed to target multiple metabolic pathways intersecting key organ systems (liver, muscle and gut) to support and maintain liver health. We believe that it may ultimately have the potential to impact hepatic histology by simultaneously influencing multiple pathways that affect metabolism, inflammation and fibrogenesis as summarized in the table below. 

Underlying Biology | AXA1125 Design Objectives 
Metabolism | Lower lipotoxicity, improve insulin sensitivity and maximize mitochondrial function by enhancing fatty acid beta-oxidation via activation of pathways such as PPARα and AMPK
Inflammation | Modulate apoptosis, macrophage function, reduce hepatic inflammatory mediators and improve gut epithelial integrity 
Fibrosis | Reduce hepatic stellate cell activation and proliferation and decrease hepatic fibrogenesis by downregulating certain pathways, including TGFβ and Hif1α

Completed Clinical Study AXA1125-003
In 2020, Axcella completed its most recent Clinical Study of AXA1125, AXA1125-003. This was a 16-week (with a two-week follow-up), randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled Clinical Study to assess safety, tolerability and impact on the liver structure and function of AXA1125 and AXA1957 in 102 adult subjects with NAFLD. Key inclusion criteria for this study included having at least 10% fat by MRI-PDFF and a corrected T1, or cT1, a measure of liver injury by multiparametric MRI, of at least 830 mSec. Subjects were stratified by the presence or absence of T2D. In this study, subjects received either AXA1125, two different doses of AXA1957 or a calorie-matched placebo control twice a day, or BID (see figure below). 
1. Study design for AXA1125-003. This Clinical Study was initiated prior to determination of AXA1125 as a therapeutic product candidate.
2. Calorie matched placebo control.
Results from the study showed that AXA1125 and AXA1957 were generally well-tolerated, with sustained reductions noted for both product candidates versus placebo in key biomarkers of metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis over 16 weeks. Overall, as compared to placebo, AXA1125 demonstrated larger and more consistent reductions in clinically relevant biomarkers than AXA1957. Among subjects receiving AXA1125, 39% achieved a ≥30% relative reduction in liver fat content (MRI-PDFF), 39% achieved a ≥17 U/L reduction in alanine aminotransaminase (ALT), and 35% achieved a ≥80 mSec reduction in corrected T1 (cT1). Among the 11 subjects with type 2 diabetes receiving AXA1125, a greater proportion achieved each of these thresholds. Emerging evidence suggests that these thresholds of activity increase the likelihood of histopathological improvement in NASH subjects. 
Notably, the above results were seen without impacting mean body weight or serum lipids. The adverse events (AEs) experienced in ≥10% of subjects were gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, reduced appetite) and upper respiratory infection. Gastrointestinal AEs were generally mild and transient, self-resolving in two to three weeks on average. Two serious adverse events were reported, both of which were determined to be unrelated to study product administration.
Given the strength and consistency of data on AXA1125, we plan to pursue its development under an IND-enabled Phase 2b Clinical Trial, subject to FDA allowance, to study its potential to treat adult NASH. Once this trial is underway, we plan to re-engage with the FDA to discuss a development approach for pediatric NASH.

Future Pipeline Opportunities 
Many EMMs, including amino acids, are well established agents used to support health. Single EMMs and simple EMM combinations also are already approved as treatments for sickle cell disease, dyslipidemia, inborn errors of metabolism and other conditions. We believe EMM compositions have the potential to address a variety of diseases and conditions, including areas related to metabolism, muscle atrophy, mitochondrial biology, neuroprotection, inflammation and immunology. We intend to continue to target biologies and disease areas driven by regulation of metabolic pathways in which we can potentially leverage the vital role that EMMs play in regulating metabolic function. To date, we have characterized approximately 75 potential therapeutic applications for EMMs based upon data from public databases, and our own metabolic profiling from biorepository samples. 
Intellectual Property
We are establishing a broad, global intellectual property portfolio for our technology and have already received 6 issued U.S. patents, including both composition of matter and method of use claims. This is notable considering the speed of our development model and establishes a foundation for the large number of submitted applications for our pipeline (283 patents pending worldwide as of December 31, 2020). Our matrixed approach to IP is inclusive of trade secrets and trademarks and encompasses our product candidates (various constituents and amounts); indications; the development platform; manufacturing processes and technologies; and formulations. In our patents for compositions and methods of use, we seek claims of broad and narrow scope. For instance, some claims cover any composition containing a minimum of specified EMMs with activity, while other claims expressly cover specific product candidates by naming all the EMMs present.
We seek to create a multi-dimensional intellectual property portfolio as a strategic asset that has the potential to provide us with a significant competitive advantage. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or through collaborations, or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to file patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of leveraging EMMs for treating complex diseases and improving health. We additionally rely on regulatory-related protections such as data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available, and where appropriate, plan to seek and rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements. Please see the section on "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property." 
As of December 31, 2020 our patent portfolio consisted of 22 patent families, 6 granted U.S. patents and 283 worldwide patents pending. To date, all of our patent rights are owned by us. Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications to protect our product candidates and certain aspects of our development platform, manufacturing processes, formulations, and insights into amounts, uses, and features of our EMM compositions.
In addition, we own a portfolio of legacy patents and patent applications related to recombinant proteins for nutrition and therapeutics, including 11 granted patents and 4 pending U.S. patent applications, and 6 granted patents and 5 pending foreign patent applications.
Examples of the product candidate and technology areas covered by our intellectual property portfolio are described below.

Our development platform iterates and integrates data from literature, including patents, in vitro experiments, animal studies and our own Clinical Studies, giving us significant competitive advantages. Our development platform, which is protected by trade secrets, is core to maintaining our first mover advantage. These advantages translate into a unique understanding of metabolism, development of many new product candidates, and creation of intellectual property around our product candidates and development platform technologies.
These development platform technologies, and our intellectual property protection related thereto, are broadly applicable to our product candidates. Our patent applications directed to platform-related technologies, if issued, would expire beginning in 2039, without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extensions we may obtain.
Therapeutic Modality Intellectual Property
Our proprietary knowledge and insights into the behavior of EMMs have yielded inventions related to categories of metabolic dysfunction, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, and fibrosis. Our patent applications directed to these underlying modalities, if issued, would expire in 2039, without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extensions we may obtain.
Table of Contents

We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new platform technologies and product candidates. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, relating to the new technologies that we develop. We will also prosecute patent applications owned by or co-owned with third party licensors. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we plan to file counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including, but not limited to, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, and South Korea.
Individual patent terms depend upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States and most other countries have patent terms that expire 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of a regulatory review period, although patent term restoration in the United States applies to a new chemical entity, so may not apply to some EMM compositions. In Europe, any patentee can obtain a supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, on the basis of approval of a therapeutic product covered by the patent based on a full clinical development program. Any restoration period is limited to a maximum restoration time (five years in the United States and Europe) and total effective patent life of the approved drug product (14 years in the United States and 15 years in Europe). The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and local decisions about the validity and enforceability of the patent.

Regulatory Exclusivity
Under certain circumstances, approval of a drug product by a health authority will result in a period of data exclusivity and/or market exclusivity (together considered as regulatory exclusivity) for the product. Data exclusivity means that no party can file for approval of a drug product based on the original drug approval application data. Market exclusivity (such as orphan drug exclusivity) means that the health authority may not be permitted to give final approval to a drug product for a defined period of time, absent certain conditions. In the United States, five-year data exclusivity is only available upon initial approval of a new chemical entity (NCE), which may not apply to some EMM product compositions. Moreover, if an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or 505(b)(2) application is filed with a “Paragraph IV certification” referencing a product protected by NCE exclusivity and Orange Book-listed patent(s), FDA may accept such application for filing four years after the reference product’s approval rather than five years. A new drug application with a Paragraph IV certification provides an opportunity for initiating patent litigation, and FDA cannot grant final approval of the application until the earlier of resolution of the patent litigation in the applicant’s favor or 30 months from the Paragraph IV notice date. Three-year market exclusivity may also be granted upon approval of applications (including supplements) containing the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies), conducted by the applicant and essential to the FDA’s approval of new versions or conditions of use of previously approved drugs, such as new indications, delivery mechanisms, dosage forms, strengths, or other conditions of use. However, the scope of such exclusivity is generally limited to the particular basis of the approval (e.g., the new indication or dosage form). In Europe, the period of regulatory exclusivity for a drug product approved based on a full stand-alone dossier consisting of quality, pre-clinical and clinical trial data is 10 years, which consists of eight years of data exclusivity against data cross-referencing of a generic application and two years of market exclusivity where the generic product (even if approved in the first eight years of the protection period) cannot be marketed until the full 10-year exclusivity or protection period has expired. This 10-year of exclusivity or protection period can be cumulatively extended to 11 years even during the first eight years of the protection/exclusivity period, the marketing authorization holder has obtained approval of one or more new therapeutic indications that are held to bring about a significant benefit as compared with existing therapies. We believe that our products, if approved, should be entitled to the full 10 years of regulatory data exclusivity in Europe. Orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S. is seven years. See “Orphan Drug Designation” for further information. Conducting a pediatric study in response to, and in compliance with the conditions of, a written request from FDA extends every form of existing regulatory exclusivity as well as patents by 6 months in the U.S. provided that the data is submitted in a timely manner. For orphan indications, the product is eligible for a period of 10 years of orphan market exclusivity in the EU, during which the EU regulatory authorities are not permitted to accept or approve a similar medicinal product in relation to the approved orphan indication. This period can be extended to a maximum of 12 years if the marketing authorization holder has conducted and provided data in compliance with an agreed pediatric investigation plan and has not secured an SPC on the basis of the product approval. Orphan drug exclusivity in Japan is 10 years. 
Trademark Protection
As of December 31, 2020, our trademark portfolio contains more than 50 registrations and pending applications. We have trademarks in over 18 countries, including the European Union. For the marks AXCELLA and the Axcella LOGO, we have pending applications in Canada and Brazil as well as International Registrations designating China, the European Union, India, Japan and Russia. In the United States we have a registration for the Axcella LOGO, and pending applications for the AXCELLA and AXCELLA HEALTH marks.

Trade Secrets
We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology and aspects of our development platform. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secret technology, e.g., AxcellaKB, confidential product candidates, and commercial plans in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. To learn more about risks related to trade secrets for our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section on "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
Manufacturing
To date, we have rapidly designed and efficiently manufactured product candidates and believe our process is readily scalable. Under our existing agreements with our manufacturers, we have been able to secure initial product candidates to initiate our Clinical Studies in less than three months from identifying the product amount needed. We continue to make enhancements to our product candidates to make them even more patient-friendly, including in their formulation (e.g., taste and texture), packaging (e.g., easy to open sachets) and administration (e.g., water soluble). Our product candidates are supplied in a dry powder form, which is dissolved in water and then administered orally as an orange-flavored drink. Our formulation enables us to deliver high concentrations of dry powder materials at appropriate administration volumes. This covers a wide range of raw material characteristics, and we believe will enable us to deliver multiple oral dosage forms to meet Clinical Study and Clinical Trial needs, as well as commercial needs.
Any product candidates that we decide to develop as drug candidates under INDs will be manufactured at a well-known contract manufacturing organization (CMO) under pharmaceutical current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) to produce the dry powder forms in sealed foil sachets. Chemical and microbiological testing of product candidates will be performed by this same CMO per defined product specifications and Certificate of Analysis will be issued for each batch. Chemical and microbiological testing will be performed using validated test methods. We believe these processing steps would enable us to readily provide high quality Clinical Trial Material, or CTM, product to support multiple Clinical Trials conducted under INDs and that are readily scalable to support commercial drug product requirements, if any of our product candidates regulated as drugs receive regulatory approval.
Government Regulation
Our ongoing research and development activities and any manufacturing and potential marketing of our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs for initial and subsequent therapeutic indications or commercialization of non-drug products and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
None of our product candidates have been approved by the FDA for marketing as a drug in the United States, and we have not marketed any product as a food (including dietary supplements) or medical food. In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products as well as non-drug products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&C Act, as amended, its implementing regulations and other laws. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution and import and export, of these products. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Table of Contents

For our product candidates developed as drugs, the process required by the FDA before such products can be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
•submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human Clinical Trials may begin;
•approval by an IRB or independent ethics committee at each Clinical Trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human Clinical Trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements and other Clinical Trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA, to accept the filing for review;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity;
•potential FDA inspection of the Clinical Trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA and/or us as Clinical Trial sponsor;
•payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA (unless a fee waiver applies);
•agreement with FDA on the final labeling for the product and the design and implementation of any required Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS); and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Regulation of Drug Product Candidates and Drugs
Preclinical and Clinical Trials
Once a product candidate is identified for development as a drug, it generally enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to evaluate the potential for adverse events, which must be conducted in accordance with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data as well as the results of our Clinical Studies, would be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans for a therapeutic indication and must become effective before human Clinical Trials for such purpose may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the Clinical Trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the Clinical Trial can begin. Submission of an IND does not ensure that FDA will allow Clinical Trials to commence at all or on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive Clinical Trial conducted during product development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, and IRB approval must be obtained before each Clinical Trial can begin.
Such Clinical Trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human volunteers under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical Trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the Clinical Trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol for our product candidates which we decide to market through the drug development pathway must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IRB for each investigator site proposing to participate in a Clinical Trial must also review and approve the Clinical Trial, including its protocol and informed consent form, before it can begin at that site, and the IRB must monitor the Clinical Trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a Clinical Trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing of drug product candidates also must satisfy extensive GCP requirements, including requirements for informed consent.
Human Clinical Trials to support NDAs, for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In certain circumstances, where sufficient evidence of safety and tolerability are collected from preclinical studies and other human experience with a product, subject to discussions and acceptance by the FDA, such as our non-IND human clinical studies, we believe that for the development of such drug candidate, a human Clinical Trial may begin at Phase II, or combined Phase I/II, rather than starting at Phase I. We would expect to discuss with the FDA such proposal to initiate the clinical development program of a drug candidate in a later phase study without first conducting a Phase I Clinical Trial or Trials.
•Phase I — Phase I Clinical Trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase II — Phase II Clinical Trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
Table of Contents

•Phase III — Phase III Clinical Trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed Clinical Trial sites. These Clinical Trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and product labeling.
Progress reports detailing the results of the Clinical Trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 calendar days for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Concurrent with Clinical Trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. FDA may require such testing to occur on a lot-by-lot basis in order to release product for clinical use. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including research tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product's showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. Clinically superior means that a drug is shown to provide a significant therapeutic advantage over and above that provided by an approved drug that is otherwise the same drug in one or more of the following ways: greater effectiveness than the approved drug, greater safety in a substantial portion of the target populations, and in unusual cases, where neither greater safety nor greater effectiveness has been shown, a demonstration that the drug otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.

Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to either expedite the development or review of important new drugs to get them to patients earlier than under standard FDA development and review procedures.
A new drug is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, as well as Priority Review, discussed below. In addition, a new drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase I, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including Priority Review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for Priority Review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. In addition, if a sponsor submits an NDA for a product intended to treat certain rare pediatric or tropical diseases or for use as a medical countermeasure for a material threat and that meets other eligibility criteria, upon approval, such sponsor may be granted a priority review voucher that can be used for a subsequent NDA. Under priority review, the FDA must review an application in six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Additionally, products for treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments are eligible for accelerated approval if they can be shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor's agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product's clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the FDA for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process.

U.S. Marketing Approval for Drugs
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing of our product candidates for drug uses, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug's safety and efficacy. The marketing application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and Clinical Trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored Clinical Trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product's use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the United States. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the 60-day filing date for a standard NDA, for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Moreover, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs. The FDA also may require submission of a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product's continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it historically has tended to follow such recommendations.
Table of Contents

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the Sponsor product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more Clinical Trial sites and/or the Clinical Trial sponsor to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and Clinical Trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV Clinical Trials, be conducted to further assess a drug's safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
U.S. Post-Approval Requirements for Drugs
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. There is also a continuing, annual prescription drug product program user fee.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or information on reduced effectiveness, requirements for post-market studies or Clinical Trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS.

Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Factors that payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan; 
•safe, effective and medically necessary; 
•appropriate for the specific patient; 
•cost-effective; and 
•neither experimental nor investigational.
The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the Company placing the medicinal product on the market. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.

Other Healthcare and Privacy Laws
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below.
•The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, provide or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order, arrangement or prescription of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term ‘‘remuneration’’ has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute.
•Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, and civil monetary penalty laws including the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program; or knowingly making a false statement or record material to payment of a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or knowingly concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have "caused" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, with respect to drug products, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product, or promoting a product off-label. Claims that include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Any future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for drug products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law.
•The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rules published January 2013, imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 
•The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program, for information related to certain payments and "transfers of value" provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. 
•Analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. These laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies implement compliance to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts. Data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions may also be more stringent than those in the United States (such as the European Union, which adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018).
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company's attention from its business.

Moreover, on October 17, 2019, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services issued a Proposed Rule: Revisions to Safe Harbors under the Anti-Kickback Statute and Civil Monetary Penalty Rules Regarding Beneficiary Inducements to, among other things, add new safe harbors for certain value-based arrangements. Although the value-based proposals would not include pharmaceutical manufacturers among the entities that could permissibly enter into such contracting arrangements, the general trend toward outcomes and value-based contracts in the healthcare industry may continue. It is possible that payors, among other customers, could push manufacturers for novel contracting approaches, including those that would incorporate value-based principles, and these efforts could affect our business. It is unclear at this time whether this proposed rule will be adopted or, if adopted, what effect, if any, it would have on the cost and ability to comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or on our business.
Current and Future Healthcare Reform Legislation
In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In particular, in 2010 the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the United States Supreme Court; the Trump Administration issued various Executive Orders that eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices; and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. The United States Supreme Court is expected to rule on a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA in early 2021. With the implementation of the ACA ongoing, the law is likely to continue the trend of downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Litigation and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. Both new legislative reforms, as well as actions taken by the Biden administration, could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, by increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and closing the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” which will shift costs for name brand drugs away from Part D participants back to the manufacturers, which could have a negative effect on our profits in the event any of our products receive FDA approval and CMS reimbursement. Similarly, CMS recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Additionally, CMS has finalized a rule that would amend the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow Medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs. In May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was became effective January 1, 2019.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) and subsequent legislation, these reductions were suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Legislative and regulatory proposals, and enactment of laws, at the foreign, federal and state levels, directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, will continue into the future.
Compliance with Other Federal and State Laws or Requirements; Changing Legal Requirements
If any products that we may develop are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to which the Company or its products may be subject.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a company to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management's attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Other U.S. Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws and Regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
Table of Contents

We maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
Foreign Regulations
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of its products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the 27-member European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the EMA where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the EU Clinical Trials Directive and the laws and regulations of the EU Member States implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the submission and approval of a clinical trial authorization application be obtained in each Member State before commencing a clinical trial in that Member State.
As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic product. For example, in the EU, if any of our products receive marketing approval in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, we expect that we will benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of marketing exclusivity. An additional one-year extension of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period we obtain an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that is deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first marketing authorization in the EU and prevents biosimilars from relying on the holder of the marketing authorization for the reference biological medicine’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data for a period of eight years. After eight years, a biosimilar product application may be submitted and the sponsoring companies may rely on the marketing authorization holder’s data. 
Table of Contents

As in the United States, a sponsor may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product.
Regulation of Medical Food Products
FDA Regulation of Medical Food Uses
To date, we have not elected to develop and market a product candidate as a medical food product and may elect never to do so. If we decide to develop one or more of our EMM compositions as a medical food product, we will have to follow regulations applicable to medical food uses.
Medical foods are a category of foods distinct from conventional food and dietary supplements. The FDA and other regulatory authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission, ("FTC"), also regulate the manufacturing, preparation, quality control, import, export, packaging, labeling, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution, safety, and/or adverse event reporting of medical foods. Among other things, manufacturers of medical foods must meet relevant cGMPs, and certain requirements that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding of foods.
As defined in section 5(b)(3) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee(b)(3)), a medical food is "a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation." The FDA has established a regulation at 21 C.F.R. 101.9(j)(8) that further defines a medical food as a product that is (1) is specially formulated and processed product (as opposed to a naturally occurring foodstuff used in its natural state) for the partial or exclusive feeding of a patient by means of oral intake or enteral feeding by tube; (2) is intended for the dietary management of a patient who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, or who has other special medically determined nutrient requirements, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone; (3) provides nutritional support specifically modified for the management of the unique nutrient needs that result from the specific disease or condition, as determined by medical evaluation; (4) is intended to be used under medical supervision; and (5) is intended only for a patient receiving active and ongoing medical supervision wherein the patient requires medical care on a recurring basis for, among other things, instructions on the use of the medical food.
Because the marketing of medical foods generally does not require FDA pre-market approval, the medical food category may offer promising opportunities for our products should we pursue that development path. However, we understand that the FDA considers the statutory definition of medical foods to narrowly constrain the types of products that fit within this category of food. There can be no assurance we will be able to develop the data that are needed to substantiate the positioning of the product as a medical food or that the FDA would concur the product meets the definition of medical food. In such cases, the commercialization of such product candidates may be delayed or prevented. To the extent that any product candidate is marketed as a medical food and subsequently determined to not fall within the proper regulatory category or are considered to be misbranded or adulterated, the Company may be subject to enforcement action or other legal consequences, including, but not limited to, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any such actions or other consequences could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its current and future ability to development the product candidates through the selected pathway or other pathways.

Moreover, the ingredients and additives used in medical foods are subject to the same regulations as conventional foods and must be "generally recognized as safe," or GRAS (as described below), or otherwise covered by an existing food additive regulation, approved food additive petition, or authorized by a prior sanction. The FDA may determine that some or all of our potential product candidates contain ingredients that are not GRAS and are therefore food additives. Such classification would cause these product candidates to require pre-market approval for a food additive, which could substantially delay or prevent the commercialization of these product candidates for medical food uses. If the FDA determines that a product candidate marketed as a medical food contains a substance that is not GRAS and is therefore a food additive after the product has already been commercialized, and such food additive is not approved or authorized by the FDA pursuant to a food additive regulation, then the Company may face enforcement or other legal consequences including, but not limited to, those mentioned above.
Under sections 201(s) and 409 of the FD&C Act, any substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food or added to food is considered to be a "food additive", with a few exceptions, and is therefore subject to FDA pre-market review and approval, unless the substance is generally recognized among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety, as having been adequately shown through scientific procedures or, in the case of a substance used prior to January 1, 1958, through experience based on common use in food, to be safe under the conditions of its intended use, a standard referred to as "generally recognized as safe," or GRAS. A food additive must either already be included within one of the FDA regulations authorizing the use of certain food additives under certain conditions of use or be approved for use by the FDA. To obtain approval for use of a food additive, a manufacturer must submit a petition to the FDA with sufficient data to demonstrate reasonable certainty of no harm at the intended levels of use. Any food that contains an unapproved food additive is considered adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act.
Ingredients that are determined to be GRAS do not fall within the definition of a food additive, which, as noted above, requires mandatory pre-market approval. Under sections 201(s) of the FD&C Act, and FDA's implementing regulations in 21 CFR § 170.3 and 21 CFR § 170.30, the use of a food substance may be GRAS either through scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food.
General recognition of safety through scientific procedures requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive and must be based upon the application of generally available and accepted scientific data, information, or methods, which are ordinarily published, as well as the application of scientific principles, and may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information. General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in foods requires a substantial history of consumption of a substance for food use by a significant number of consumers. If an ingredient is GRAS for one use or in one form, it is not necessarily GRAS for all uses or forms. Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, it is the intended use of a substance, rather than the substance itself, that is eligible for classification as GRAS.
Manufacturers of GRAS substances may notify the FDA of their view that a substance is GRAS and thus not subject to the pre-market approval requirements of section 409 of the FD&C Act. The notification must include, among other things, a description of the substance, the applicable conditions of use, the dietary exposure, an explanation of the basis for the determination that the substance was determined to be safe for the intended use and supporting data and information. Upon review of such a notification, the FDA may respond with a "no questions" letter stating that while it has not made its own GRAS determination, it has no questions at the time regarding the applications' own GRAS determination. Alternatively, manufacturers may elect to "self-affirm" a given substance is GRAS without the voluntary FDA notification but should retain all applicable safety data used for the GRAS determination in the case of inquiry by the FDA. However, in neither case does this constitute an approval equivalent to that achieved through the food additive process. A manufacturer's use of such food additive is at its own risk and is dependent upon adequate substantiation and/or scientific support demonstrating safe use.
Government Regulation of Food for Special Medical Purpose in the European Union
The regulatory requirements for foods for special medical purposes, or FSMPs, in the European Union cover FSMP development and commercialization.
Table of Contents

In the European Union, FSMPs are designed to feed patients who, because of a particular disease, disorder or medical condition, have nutritional needs that cannot be met by consuming standard foodstuffs. European Union regulation defines food for special medical purposes' as food specially processed or formulated and intended for the dietary management of patients, including infants, to be used under medical supervision; it is intended for the exclusive or partial feeding of patients with a limited, impaired or disturbed capacity to take, digest, absorb, metabolize or excrete ordinary food or certain nutrients contained therein, or metabolites, or with other medically-determined nutrient requirements, whose dietary management cannot be achieved by modification of the normal diet alone.
Businesses intending to commercialize FSMPs in the European Union are required to register their FSMPs by submitting notifications regarding FSMP use, demonstrating compliance with applicable European Union rules, prior to market commercialization. These notifications to competent authority of each European Union Member State include information appearing on the label, and any other information the competent authority may reasonably request to establish compliance with this Regulation.
The European Commission may decide, by means of implementing acts (a) whether a given food falls within the scope of this Regulation; and (b) to which specific category of food a given food belongs. European Food Safety Authority Guidance provides, among other requirements, that the dossier must include an explanation of the scientific and medical basis on which it has been concluded that the use of the specific food product is necessary or is more practical or safer than the exclusive use of non-FSMP foodstuffs.
FSMPs can also fall within the scope of the novel food legislation in the European Union. Where an ingredient used in the FSMP to be marketed in the European Union falls within the definition of a 'novel food ingredient' prior authorization for use of the ingredient needs to be sought. A "novel" food and food ingredient can be defined as food that has not been consumed to a significant degree by humans in the European Union before May 15, 1997 and that falls within one of the ten food categories listed. Novel foods and novel food ingredients can only be authorized if they do not pose a safety risk to human health, their intended use does not mislead the consumer and they do not differ from the food they are intended to replace in such a way that its normal consumption would be nutritionally disadvantageous for the consumer. The authorization procedure is likely to take between 12 and 18 months.
In accordance with European Union Clinical Trials directives, before a Clinical Trial site is allowed to start enrolling patients in a Clinical Trial, the IRB/independent ethics committee, or IEC, must provide a positive opinion concerning the study protocol and all study-related materials. The competent authorities of the relevant European Union Member State must also provide their related authorization. Clinical Trials involving the investigation of the action of non-medicinal products (e.g., foods, such as many FSMPs), are not covered and are not required to register the Clinical Trial or to complete a Clinical Trial application (CTA) for approval by a European Union Member State.
Competition
The healthcare industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical, nutritional foods companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and universities and other research institutions. 
There are additional companies that are working on modulating specific metabolic pathways involved in various health and disease conditions, although we are not aware of any company creating Axcella product candidate-like products with multifactorial activity for the same indications and targets as Axcella. Entrinsic Biosciences, Inc. is developing amino acid compositions to treat gastrointestinal disorders and other conditions associated with dysfunctional transport membrane proteins. Companies with clinical programs that could compete with our current pipeline of product candidates include 89bio, Inc., Akero Therapeutics, Inc., Bausch Health, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., Genfit SA, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Kaleido Biosciences, Inc., Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mallinckrodt plc, NGM Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Novartis AG, Scholar Rock Holding Corporation, and Viking Therapeutics, Inc., among others.
Table of Contents

We also anticipate competing with the largest consumer health companies and nutritional and amino acid companies in the world, such as Abbott Laboratories, Ajinomoto Co., Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Nestlé Health Science S.A., and The Procter & Gamble Company, all of which are currently conducting research in competitive indications or may be interested in using amino acids and other EMMs as therapeutics as well as nutritional supplements.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had 59 full-time employees, 40 of which were engaged in research and development activities and 25 of which have Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. The remaining 19 employees were engaged in business development, finance, information systems, facilities, human resources, legal functions, or administrative support. We also engage consultants and temporary workers when needed. The majority of our employees were based in Cambridge, MA. No employees were represented by labor unions or subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
We believe our employees are among the Company’s most important assets and are key to achieving our goals and expectations. Our human capital resource priorities, and our competitive equity and cash compensation and benefits programs focus on attracting, recruiting, retaining and incentivizing our existing and new employees. We consider our human capital resources strategy to be comprehensive and we foster a strong relationship with and among our employees with ongoing efforts such as employee surveys, training and development programs, social interactions, and other programs built around our core values: ownership, determination, collaboration, and learning. We plan to continue to evolve and add to our suite of human capital resources as we grow.
In particular, Axcella is committed to developing policies that promote awareness and behaviors to ensure fair treatment and equality of opportunity, building a culture of diversity and inclusion, and proactively addressing inequality. This includes policies and practices that uphold these principles throughout the sourcing, hiring, compensation and assessment of candidates, and employees. Axcella has joined the MassBio Open Letter 2.0 CEO Pledge for a More Equitable and Inclusive Life Sciences Industry.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and as part of our commitment to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, we activated our applicable business continuity plans, including creating an employee committee under our human resources function to recommend and implement policies consistent with US Government, Massachusetts, City of Cambridge, and industry standard regulations and guidance in response to the public health emergency. Since mid-March 2020, the vast majority of our employees have been working from home. Additionally, we put appropriate safety measures in place, including implementing occupancy limits, restricting business travel, providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, health screening, cleaning and visitor protocols, and, in cases of possible exposure, external COVID-19 testing to access our workplaces.
Facilities
We lease a facility containing 19,200 square feet of laboratory and office space, which is located at 840 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The lease expires in April 2024, subject to an option to extend the lease for an additional three years.
