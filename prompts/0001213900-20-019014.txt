Item 1. Business
History
 
We are a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1980 under the name Arbor Energy Corporation. In 1984, we changed our name to Arbor Entech Corp.
 
Until September 2, 2003, we were engaged in the production and wholesale distribution of wood products for home use, principally fireplace wood and garden stakes. Our products were packaged in and distributed from our facility in Little Marsh, Pennsylvania.
 
On June 22, 2018, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with a third party (the “Purchaser”) and certain selling stockholders, including the Company’s controlling stockholders (all of the selling stockholders, collectively, the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the SPA, the Purchaser agreed to acquire approximately 98.75% of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock (the “Shares”). The transaction contemplated by the SPA was subject to various conditions, including payment of a cash dividend to the Company’s stockholders and the Company’s changing its name and ticker symbol as per the direction of the Purchaser.
 
On July 6, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company (i) declared a cash dividend in an aggregate amount of $181,996, or an average of $0.024760 per share, payable to stockholders of record on July 16, 2018, and (ii) approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to change the Company’s name to Evergreen International, Corp., which amendment was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on July 13, 2018 and became effective on July 20, 2018.
 
On July 27, 2018, the transaction contemplated by the SPA closed and the Purchaser acquired the Shares for a cash consideration of $325,000. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the SPA resulted in a change of control of the Company.
 
Currently, the Company only possesses minimal assets and liabilities with no substantial business operations. There were no significant revenues or positive cash flows for the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019. The Company’s management efforts are focused on seeking out a new and profitable operating business with strong growth potential. Unless and until the Company’s successful acquisition of an operating business, we expect our expenses to consist of legal fees, accounting fees, and administrative costs related to maintaining a public company.
 
Current Business Strategy
 
The Company is seeking one or more potential business opportunities through merger or acquisition or the establishment of a new business. However, due to our limited working capital, it is likely that we will enter into only one business transaction.
 
We may also seek to acquire one or more majority and/or wholly owned equity positions in other companies through the direct purchase of stock. Such equity positions will be limited by Section 3(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”), in that we will not be permitted to own or propose to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of our total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.
 
We may provide debt financing to companies in which we have taken (or intend to take) an equity position. Such financing would generally be made on an unsecured basis. In no event will we provide financing for or take equity positions in companies where the aggregate of such investments would cause us to be required to register under the 1940 Act.

Our present management may or may not become involved as management in the aforementioned business or subsidiary or may hire qualified but not yet unidentified management personnel. There can, however, be no assurance whatsoever that we will be able to acquire a business. A potential acquisition of a business may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares. A company that seeks a transaction with us in order to consolidate its operations through a merger, reorganization, asset acquisition, or some other form of combination may desire to do so to avoid what it may deem to be adverse consequences of itself undertaking a public offering. Factors considered may include time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control. In connection with such acquisition, it is possible that an amount of stock constituting control of us would be purchased from us or our current officers, directors and stockholders resulting in substantial profits to such persons without similar profits being realized by other stockholders. Moreover, no assurance can be given with respect to the experience or qualifications of as yet unknown persons who may, in the future, manage our operations and affairs or any business or subsidiary acquired by us. In the event of a change in control of us and our Board of Directors, the payment of any dividends would be wholly dependent upon such persons. Furthermore, it is impossible as yet to determine what, if any, rights applicable state law may provide to our shareholders in any merger or reorganization.
 
We may establish or acquire a business and/or invest in one or more new and developing companies, whether directly or by way of statutory merger, which we believe will offer significant long-term growth potential. In the case of an equity position, we will seek to acquire primarily a majority owned and wholly owned capital stock position in such corporation. We are not restricted to any particular industry and may engage in any line of business. Accordingly, we have broad discretion as to the type of businesses we may acquire and equity investments we may make.
 
We assume that any business we acquire or equity investment we make, whether directly or by way of statutory merger, will involve a business that is new and unseasoned, or a business that has been operating for a limited period of time and has a limited or unsuccessful record of revenues or earnings. Investments in start-up enterprises involve a high degree of risk of total loss of investment. Except in cases of a merger or other instances where stockholders’ approval may be required by applicable law, our stockholders will not have the opportunity to review the relative merits or weaknesses of any proposed business to be acquired or equity investment to be made and, accordingly, will have to rely upon the discretion of our management in selecting a business or investment.
 
We have identified certain general policies which we will consider in evaluating business acquisition candidates and investment possibilities. These policies are listed below. In no event will we provide financing or take equity positions in companies where the aggregate of such investments would cause us to be required to register under the 1940 Act.
 

1. | We will examine the products or services of a business being considered to determine whether a market exists for the products or services and whether the business can manufacture and/or market the products or produce the services at a competitive cost.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | We will invest in a company that we believe has a strong potential for growth. We will evaluate the company’s business and determine the quality and experience of its management.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | We may invest in an operating company that has experienced increases in gross revenues which exceed industry averages. The market for the company’s products will be evaluated by determining the relationship of size, growth potential and competitive factors in that company’s industry. This may include the purchase of businesses which offer opportunities for consolidation.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | We will also consider the following factors:
---+---------------------------------------------


(a) | Special risks associated with the business and the industry,
----+-------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Equity available to the business,
----+----------------------------------


(c) | Capital requirements of the business,

(d) | Potential for profitability and

(e) | The effect of market and economic conditions and governmental policies on the business and its products.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
It is unlikely that any one prospective corporation with which we may seek to enter a relationship will conform in all respects to the policies described above. Accordingly, this description is intended to serve only as a general guide for our projected investment activities. These policies are not fundamental policies and may be changed at any time by our Board of Directors.
 
We anticipate that we will be brought into contact with a prospective business acquisition or equity investment primarily through the efforts of its officers, directors and principal stockholders who in the course of their business activities frequently come into contact with companies whose products, services or concepts may be subject to successful development and marketing. In such connection, we may pay a bonus to such officers, directors, principal stockholders or their affiliates. Any such payment would not be higher than that which would ordinarily be paid to a non-affiliated person.
 
We do not have any contracts or commitments with anyone or any firm with regard to these business activities. We also do not have any arrangements or understandings with respect to the acquisition of any business entity or the acquisition of any interest therein.

We may use independent consultants (who may agree to receive our stock in payment for their services in lieu of cash) to explore areas of, and to seek out, acquisition prospects. Such independent consultants would be expected to have such expertise or knowledge which would be of use to us in any investment decision. We have not engaged any independent consultants for the past three years.
 
At this time, we believe that any equity investments will be made in private transactions with privately owned corporations. Securities acquired in this manner are restricted from public sale unless they are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or unless an exemption from registration is available.
 
Government Regulation
 
We may be subject to government regulations promulgated by various local, state and Federal government agencies with regard to its proposed business. Additionally, if we purchase equity positions, we will be subject to various rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the various state securities commissions. We do not intend to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities or otherwise engaging in activities which would render us an “investment company” as defined in the 1940 Act.
 
Our financing activities will be limited by Section 3(a)(3) of the 1940 Act in that the we will not be permitted to own or propose to acquire investment securities having a total value exceeding 40% of the value of our total assets (excluding government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We are permitted under Section 3(a)(3) of the 1940 Act to own or propose to own securities of a majority owned subsidiary which is defined under Section 2(a)(24) of the 1940 Act to mean 50% or more of the outstanding securities of which are owned by us or our majority owned subsidiary. Notwithstanding Section 3(a)(3) of the 1940 Act, we would not be considered an investment company where we are engaged directly or indirectly through a wholly-owned subsidiary (which is defined to mean at least 95% ownership of the outstanding voting stock), in a business or businesses, other than that of investing, owning, holding or trading in securities.
 
In addition to the limitations imposed by the 1940 Act as mentioned above, there are a number of other provisions of the federal securities laws which will affect our proposed investments.
 
Most, if not all, of the securities which we acquire as equity investments will be “restricted securities” within the meaning of the Securities Act and will not be permitted to be resold without compliance with the Securities Act. The registration of securities owned by us is likely to be a time consuming and expensive process, and we always bear the risk that, because of these delays, we will be unable to resell such securities, or that we will not be able to obtain an attractive price for the securities. It is highly improbable that we would be able to sell any of the securities we acquired.
 
Competition
 
There are numerous companies seeking business opportunities which are larger, have more experience, and are better financed than we are. We may encounter intense competition from numerous other firms seeking new business opportunities. Any investments we make will entail a high degree of business and financial risk that may result in substantial losses to us.
Personnel
 
Jianguo Wei is the sole Director, CEO, CFO, President and Treasurer of the Company.
