Item 1. Description of Business.

HMG/Courtland Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries (“HMG”, or the “Company”), is a Delaware corporation organized in 1972. The Company’s business is the ownership and management of income-producing commercial properties and it will consider other investments if they offer growth or profit potential.

HMG qualifies under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code for taxation as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), excluding its 95% owned taxable REIT subsidiary Courtland Investments, Inc. (“CII”), which files a separate tax return. 

As previously reported on Form 8-K dated July 19, 2019, pursuant to the terms of a Construction and Mini Perm Loan Agreement ("Loan Agreement"), between Murano At Three Oaks Associates LLC, a Florida limited liability company formed in September 2018 (the “Borrower”) which is 25% owned by HMG, and PNC Bank, National Association ("Lender"), Lender provided a construction loan to the Borrower for the principal sum of approximately $41.59 million (“Loan”). The proceeds of the Loan shall be used to finance the construction of multi-family residential apartments containing 318 units totaling approximately 312,000 net rentable square feet on a 17.5-acre site located in Fort Myers, Florida ("Project").  The Project site was purchased by the Borrower concurrently with the closing of the Loan. Total development costs for the Project are estimated at approximately $56.08 million and the Borrower’s equity totals approximately $14.49 million. HMG’s share of the equity is 25%, or approximately $3.62 million.  As of December 31, 2019, there was no outstanding balance on the Loan.  In 2020, there have been two draws on the Loan totaling approximately $2.7 million. The project is on budget and as a percentage of the total budget the amount completed is approximately 31%.

HMG and the other members (or affiliates thereof) of the Borrower ("Guarantors") entered into a Completion Guaranty ("Completion Guaranty") and a Guaranty and Suretyship Agreement ("Repayment Guaranty") (collectively, the “Guaranties”).  Under the Completion Guaranty, each Guarantor shall unconditionally guaranty, as a primary obligor, and become surety for the prompt payment and performance by Borrower of the “Guaranteed Obligations” (as defined).  Under the Repayment Guaranty, Guarantor unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor, and becomes surety for the prompt payment and performance of, as defined (i) all Interest Obligations, (ii) all Loan Document Obligations, (iii) all Expense Obligations, (iv) the Carrying Cost Obligations, (v) the Principal Amount, (vi) interest on each of the foregoing including, if applicable, interest at the Default Rate (as defined).  At all times prior to the First Reduction Date (as defined below), the Guarantors are collectively responsible for 30% of the Principal Obligations, (ii) at all times after the First Reduction Date, the Guarantors are collectively responsible for15% of the Principal Obligations, and (iii) at all times after the Second Reduction Date, 0% of the Principal Obligations. First Reduction Conditions" means satisfaction of the following conditions: (i) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; (ii) Completion of Construction has occurred; and (iii)   the Project has achieved a DSCR of not less than 1.25 to 1.00 for two (2) consecutive fiscal quarters.

Each Guarantor is required to maintain compliance with the following financial covenants, as defined: (1) liquidity shall not be less than $2.5 million. Liquidity is defined as the sum of unencumbered, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and (2) net worth shall not be less than $10 million.  As of December 31, 2019, HMG was in compliance with all covenants required by Guarantors in the Loan Agreement.

The Company’s portfolio of REIT marketable securities consists primarily of preferred equity of large capital publicly traded REITs with a market value of approximately $1.86 million as of December 31, 2019.

The Company’s investments in non-REIT marketable securities include equity and debt securities issued primarily by large capital companies or government agencies with readily determinable fair values in varying industries. This includes real estate investment trusts and mutual funds focusing in commercial real estate activities. Substantially all the Company’s marketable securities investments are in companies listed on major national stock markets, however the overall investment portfolio and some of the Company’s investment strategies could be viewed as risky and the market values of the portfolio may be subject to fluctuations. Consistent with the Company’s overall investment objectives and activities, management classifies all marketable securities as being held in a trading portfolio. Accordingly, all unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s investments in marketable securities are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Marketable securities are stated at market value as determined by the most recently traded price of each security at the balance sheet date. Information regarding the amounts and types of investments in marketable securities is set forth in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company may realize gains and losses in its overall investment portfolio from time to time to take advantage of market conditions and/or manage the portfolio’s resources and the Company’s tax liability. The Company may utilize margin for its marketable securities purchases using standard margin agreements with national brokerage firms. The use of available leverage is guided by the business judgment of management. The Company may also use options and futures to hedge concentrated stock positions and index futures to hedge against market risk and enhance the performance of the Company’s portfolio while reducing the overall portfolio’s risk and volatility.

The Company’s other investments consist primarily of nominal equity interests in various privately held entities, including limited partnerships whose purpose is to invest venture capital funds in growth-oriented enterprises. The Company does not have significant influence over any investee and the Company’s investments typically represent less than 5% of the investee’s ownership. Some of these investments give rise to exposure resulting from the volatility in capital markets. The Company mitigates its risks by diversifying its investment portfolio. Information with respect to the amounts and types of other investments including the nature of the declines in value is set forth in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reference is made to Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence for discussion of the Company’s organizational structure and related party transactions.

Investment in Affiliate. 

The Company’s investment in affiliate consists of a 49% equity interest in T.G.I.F. Texas, Inc. (“TGIF”). TGIF was incorporated in Texas and operates solely from the Company’s corporate office in Miami, Florida. The Company’s CEO, Maurice Wiener, is also the CEO of TGIF. Its assets consist primarily of promissory notes receivable from its shareholders including CII and Mr. Wiener and other investments including marketable debt and equity securities. This investment’s carrying value as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $1.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. CII’s note payable to TGIF which is due on demand was approximately $1.0 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Reference is made to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Insurance, Environmental Matters and Other:

In the opinion of management, all significant real estate assets of the Company are adequately covered by insurance or are self-insured. 

As previously reported, in May 2018, the Company (an approximate 70% owner) and the other (approximate 30%) owner of a 6-acre property located in Montpelier, Vermont (the “Property”), together “the Owners”, received a Determination of Eligibility under the Brownfields Reuse and Liability Limitation Act (BRELLA) related to an environmental remediation (“the remediation plan”) of the Property.  Under BRELLA the Owners will receive a Certificate of Completion upon performance of all actions required under the approved corrective action plan developed for the Property.  Statutory liability protections become effective upon issuance of the Certificate of Completion.  Forbearance from state enforcement action is in effect during the BRELLA provided that all required activities are being implemented in good faith. Areas of concern identified in the Phase II Environmental Site Assessment conducted by an environmental consulting firm in consultation with the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation (VTDEC) include (1) discharges of coal tar to the bank of the Winooski River on the northern portion of the property (the “River Coal Tar”), (2) buried coal tar present in several locations on the northern portion of the Property (the “Subsurface Coal Tar”) and (3) urban fill soils (the “Urban Fill Soils”) located throughout the southern portion of the property.  In April 2019, the Owners entered into a Pre-Development Agreement with an unrelated local Montpelier real estate developer to remediate the Property.  The Owners agreed to pay a fixed fee of $500,000 to the local developer to implement the remediation plan.  The Company’s portion of the fixed fee is approximately 70%, or $350,000 and has been accrued on the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019. The remediation work began in December 2019.  Groundwater monitoring will continue for another year before a Certificate of Completion can be issued.

Competition and the Company’s Market

The Company competes for suitable opportunities for real estate investments with other real estate investment trusts, foreign investors, pension funds, insurance companies and other investors. The Company also competes with other real estate investors and borrowers for available sources of financing.

In addition, to the extent the Company leases properties it must compete for tenants with other lessors offering similar facilities. Tenants are sought by providing modern, well-maintained facilities at competitive rentals. The Company has attempted to facilitate successful leasing of its properties by investing in facilities that have been developed according to the specifications of tenants and special local needs.
