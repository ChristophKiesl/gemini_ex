Introduction
 
A SPAC I Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”) is a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands as a BVI business company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
 
On February 17, 2022, the Company consummated the initial public offering (“IPO”) of 6,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share (“Ordinary Share”), three-fourths (3/4) of one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), and one right (“Right”) to receive one-tenth of one Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) with A SPAC (Holdings) Acquisition Corp., the Company’s sponsor, of 2,875,000 warrants (the “Private Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Warrant, generating total proceeds of $2,875,000. The Private Warrants are identical to the public Warrants sold in the IPO, as set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, except as described in the Warrant Agreement.
 
On February 17, 2022, a total of $60,600,000 ($10.10 per Unit) of the net proceeds from the IPO and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders (the “Trust Account”).
 
Subsequently, on February 25, 2022, the underwriters notified the Company their election to exercise their over-allotment option in full. The closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units occurred (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) on March 1, 2022. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 900,000 Over-Allotment Option Units at a price of $10.00 per unit generated total gross proceeds of $9,000,000. On March 1, 2022, simultaneously with the closing and sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 270,000 Private Warrants to the sponsor generating gross proceeds of $270,000.
 
The Private Warrants were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
 
On March 1, 2022, an additional $9,090,000 ($10.10 per Unit) consisting of the net proceeds from the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units, less the underwriter’s discount of $0.20 per Over-Allotment Option Unit ($180,000), and the gross proceeds from the sale of the additional private warrants ($270,000) was placed in the Trust Account, resulting in a total of $69,690,000 held in the Trust Account as of that date.
 
Leadership of an Experienced Management and Director Team
 
We are led by Claudius Tsang, our Chairman, our Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Financial Officer. Our management and director team’s past performance is not an assurance that we will be able to identify an appropriate candidate for our initial business combination or achieve success with respect to the business combination we intend to consummate. However, we believe that the skills and professional network of our management and director team will enable us to identify, structure and consummate a business combination.

Investment Criteria
 
Consistent with our strategy, we will primarily seek to acquire one or more growth businesses with a total enterprise value of between $250 million and $600 million. Although we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the criteria described below, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines as we evaluate prospective target companies:

· | Distinct competitive advantages and/or underexploited growth opportunities that our team is positioned to identify; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We intend to seek target companies that have competitive advantages and/or underexploited expansion opportunities and can benefit from access to additional capital as well as expertise. We intend to target businesses that have historically demonstrated revenue growth and possess favorable future growth characteristics, combined with a defensible business model. Our management and director team has significant experience in identifying such targets and in helping company executives assess their strategic and financial strength.
 

· | Strong management and director team that can create significant value for the target company; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will seek to identify companies with strong and experienced management and director team. We believe we can provide a platform for the existing management and director team to leverage the experience of our management and director team. We intend to seek teams that have demonstrated the ability to scale, and is also well-incentivized and aligned in our future vision for creating long term shareholder value.
 

· | Exhibit value or other characteristics that we believe have been misevaluated by the market; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will seek target companies which exhibit characteristics that we believe have been overlooked or misevaluated by the market based on our company-specific analyses and due diligence. We intend to leverage our significant experience across complex transactions and the disciplined investment approach of our team to identify opportunities that will unlock value for our shareholders.
 

· | Benefit from being a public company; 
--+-----------------------------------------

We will look for public-ready management and director team that have a track record of value creation for their shareholders, with the ambition to take advantage of the improved liquidity and additional capital that can come from a successful listing in the United States. We believe that there are a substantial number of potential target businesses with appropriate valuations that can benefit from a public listing and new capital to support significant revenue and earnings growth.
 
Other Acquisition Considerations
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
Unless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, or our Board of Directors cannot independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions or from an independent accounting firm that the price we are paying for a target is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the business judgment of our Board of Directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of the target or targets, and different methods of valuation may vary greatly in outcome from one another. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.
 
Members of our management and director team may directly or indirectly own our Class A ordinary shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Each of our sponsors, directors and officers presently has, and in the future any of our sponsors, directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands law, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide that, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under British Virgin Islands law, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially undermine our ability to complete our business combination.
 
Our sponsor, officers and directors are, and may become a sponsor, an officer or director of other special purpose acquisition companies with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding that, such officers and directors will continue to have a pre-existing fiduciary obligation to us and we will, therefore, have priority over any special purpose acquisition companies they subsequently join.

Management Operating and Investment Experience
 
We believe that our executive officers possess the experience, skills and contacts necessary to source, evaluate, and execute an attractive business combination. See the section titled “Management” for complete information on the experience of our officers and directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs and will allocate their time to other businesses. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. The past successes of our executive officers and directors do not guarantee that we will successfully consummate an initial business combination.
 
As more fully discussed in “Conflicts of Interest,” if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Delaware law, prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Most of our officers and directors currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status and Other Information
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised, and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the date of the IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three year period.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could complete a business combination with utilizing our net proceeds, our ability to compete in completing a business combination with certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources. Furthermore, the requirement that, so long as our securities are listed on Nasdaq, we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (less deferred underwriting discounts and any taxes payable on interest earned and less any interest earned thereon that is released to us for taxes) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights, and our outstanding private placement warrants and the potential future dilution they represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have one officer. This individual is not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but he intends to devote as much of his time as he deems necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time he will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
