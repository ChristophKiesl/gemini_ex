Item 1. Business 
Introduction 
 We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 24, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to in this report as our initial business combination. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or geographical location, we have initially focused our search within the technology sector, where we believe our management team has a competitive advantage due to their prior experiences and roles. We have initially focused our search efforts on North American-based targets with an aggregate enterprise value of $1 billion to $2 billion. 
 We believe our management team is well positioned to identify attractive businesses within the technology sector that would benefit from access to the public markets and the skills of our management team. Our objective is to consummate our initial business combination and enhance stockholder value by helping to identify and recruit effective management, enhance existing business models and strategic planning, identify and complete follow-on acquisitions, implement operational improvements, and expand product offerings and geographic footprint. We are utilizing our management team’s experience and network to help achieve their objectives. We are focusing on evaluating established companies with leading competitive positions, strong management teams, and long-term potential for growth and profitability. 
 On June 22, 2020, we issued 5,750,000 founder shares to our sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share. On August 18, 2020, our sponsor transferred an aggregate of 80,000 founder shares to our independent directors for their original purchase price. Subsequently, on August 27, 2020, our sponsor transferred an aggregate of 70,000 founder shares to certain of our special advisors for their original purchase price. On October 2, 2020, we effected a stock dividend of 1,437,500 shares with respect to our Class B common stock, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 7,187,500 founder shares. Following such dividend, on October 2, 2020, our sponsor transferred 18,750 founder shares to one of our special advisors for their original purchase price. On October 20, 2020, we effected a further stock dividend of 1,437,500 shares with respect to our Class B common stock, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 8,625,000 founder shares. Following the expiration of the underwriter’s over-allotment option, on December 7, 2020 our sponsor forfeited 1,125,000 founder shares, so that our initial stockholders continue to own 20% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock after our initial public offering, described below. 
 On October 20, 2020, the registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-249274) relating to our initial public offering was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and we subsequently filed, on October 20, 2020, a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-249575) pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), which was effective immediately upon filing. On October 23, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering of 30,000,000 units, with each unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $300,000,000. 
 Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 8,000,000 private placement warrants to our sponsor at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating total proceeds of $8,000,000 (the “private placement”). 
 A total of $300,000,000 (or $10.00 per unit sold in our initial public offering) of the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement was placed in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders (the “trust account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and has been invested only in U.S. “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations (and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, as applicable), the net proceeds from our initial public offering and the private placement will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (a) the completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A common stock the right to have their shares redeemed or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by October 23, 2022 or (ii) with respect to any other provisions relating to the rights of holders of our Class A common stock, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination by October 23, 2022, subject to applicable law.

  Transaction costs amounted to $6,477,876, consisting of $6,000,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions and $477,876 for other costs and expenses related to our initial public offering. In addition, the underwriter of our initial public offering agreed to defer agreed to defer $10,500,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial business combination, if consummated. As of December 31, 2021, we had $124,720 in our operating bank accounts, $300,183,322 in cash and marketable securities held in the trust account and an adjusted working capital deficit of $2,404,830, which excludes $183,322 of interest earned on the trust account that is available to pay franchise and income taxes payable. 
 Our units began trading on October 21, 2020 on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “XPOA.U.” Commencing on December 11, 2020, the Class A common stock and warrants comprising the units began separate trading on the NYSE under the symbols “XPOA” and “XPOA WS,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “XPOA.U.” 
 Proposed Transaction 
 Subsequent to the period covered by this report, on February 7, 2022, we entered into a transaction agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) with D-Wave Quantum Inc., a Delaware corporation and our direct, wholly-owned subsidiary (“NewCo”), DWSI Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of NewCo (“Merger Sub”), DWSI Canada Holdings ULC, a British Columbia unlimited liability company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of NewCo (“CallCo”), D-Wave Quantum Technologies Inc., a British Columbia corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of CallCo (“ExchangeCo”), and D-Wave Systems Inc., a British Columbia company (“D-Wave”), relating to a proposed business combination between our company and D-Wave (the “Proposed Transaction”). 
 NewCo will file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (the “NewCo Form S-4”) that will include a prospectus with respect to NewCo’s securities to be issued in connection with the Proposed Transaction and a proxy statement with respect to the meeting of our stockholders to vote on the Proposed Transaction. There can be no assurance as to whether or when the Proposed Transaction will be completed. 
Transaction Agreement 
 Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, among other things, (a) on the date of the closing of the Proposed Transaction (the “Closing”, and such date, the “Closing Date”), Merger Sub will merge with and into our company (the “Merger”), with our company continuing as the surviving company after the Merger, as a result of which we will become a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NewCo, with our stockholders receiving shares of NewCo common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“NewCo Common Shares”), in the Merger; and (b) immediately following the Merger, by means of a statutory plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “Plan of Arrangement”), (i) CallCo will acquire a portion of the issued and outstanding share capital of D-Wave (“D-Wave Shares”) from certain holders in exchange for NewCo Common Shares (the “NewCo Share Exchange”), (ii) CallCo will contribute such D-Wave Shares to ExchangeCo in exchange for shares of ExchangeCo’s non-par value common stock (“ExchangeCo Common Shares”), (iii) following the NewCo Share Exchange, ExchangeCo will acquire the remaining issued and outstanding D-Wave Shares from the remaining holders of D-Wave Shares in exchange for the exchangeable shares in the capital of ExchangeCo (“Exchangeable Shares”) and (iv) as a result of the foregoing, D-Wave will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of ExchangeCo. The holders of the Exchangeable Shares will have certain rights as specified in the Exchangeable Share Term Sheet (as defined in the Transaction Agreement), including the right to exchange Exchangeable Shares for NewCo Common Shares. 
 The Transaction Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and closing conditions, including, but not limited to, approval by our stockholders of the Transaction Agreement and the Proposed Transaction. The terms of the Transaction Agreement and other related ancillary agreements entered into or to be entered into in connection with the Closing of the Proposed Transaction, including those briefly described below, are summarized in more detail in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 11, 2022 and will be summarized in greater detail in the NewCo Form S-4 when available. 
 Sponsor Support Agreement 
 Concurrently with the execution of the Transaction Agreement, we entered into a sponsor support agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”) with our sponsor, NewCo and D-Wave, pursuant to which, among other things, our sponsor agreed to (i) vote in favor of the Transaction Agreement and the Proposed Transaction, (ii) a certain number of NewCo Common Shares becoming subject to certain vesting conditions immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Closing, (iii) reimburse or otherwise compensate our company for certain expenses in excess of our permitted expenses under the Transaction Agreement and (iv) the forfeiture of certain founder shares.

  Transaction Support Agreements 
 Concurrently with the execution of the Transaction Agreement, we entered into transaction support agreements (the “Transaction Support Agreements”) with D-Wave and certain D-Wave shareholders (collectively, the “Supporting Shareholders”), pursuant to which each such Supporting Shareholder agreed to, among other things, support and vote in favor of the Company Arrangement Resolution (as defined in the Transaction Agreement). 
PIPE Subscription Agreements 
 Concurrently with the execution of the Transaction Agreement, we entered into subscription agreements (the “PIPE Subscription Agreements”) with NewCo and certain investors (collectively, the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which, among other things, each PIPE Investor subscribed to and agreed to purchase on the Closing Date, and NewCo agreed to issue and sell to each such PIPE Investor on the Closing Date, the number of NewCo Common Shares (“PIPE Shares”) equal to the purchase price set forth therein, divided by $10.00 and multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Transaction Agreement), totaling $40.0 million of PIPE Shares in the aggregate, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. 
 Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement 
 At the Closing of the Proposed Transaction, NewCo, our sponsor, the other holders of founder shares and each D-Wave shareholder party thereto will, pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, become parties to a registration rights and lock-up agreement (the “Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, each of our sponsor, the other holders of founder shares and such D-Wave shareholders (collectively, the “Holders”) (a) will agree not to effect any sale or distribution of certain equity securities of NewCo held by any of them during the lock-up period described therein and (b) will be granted certain registration rights with respect to their respective NewCo Common Shares, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. 
 Previously Terminated Business Combination Agreement 
 On May 19, 2021, we entered into a business combination agreement (the “Jam City BCA”) with VNNA Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and our direct, wholly-owned subsidiary (“VNNA Merger Sub”), Jam City, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Jam City”), and New Jam City, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Jam City (“New JC LLC”), relating to a then-contemplated business combination between our company and Jam City (the “Jam City Business Combination”). 
 On July 23, 2021, we entered into a Termination of Business Combination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) with VNNA Merger Sub, our sponsor, Jam City and New JC LLC, pursuant to which the parties agreed to mutually terminate the Jam City BCA effective as of July 23, 2021. As a result of the termination of the Jam City BCA, the Jam City BCA is void and there is no liability under the Jam City BCA on the part of any party thereto, except as set forth in the Jam City BCA, and each of the transaction agreements entered into in connection with the Jam City BCA, including, but not limited to, (i) the Sponsor Support Agreement, dated as of May 19, 2021, by and among our company, our sponsor, Jam City and New JC LLC, (ii) the Stockholder Support Agreement, dated as of May 19, 2021, by and among our company and certain stockholders of Jam City, and (iii) the subscription agreements entered into between our company and certain investors concurrently with the execution of the Jam City BCA, dated as of May 19, 2021, were automatically either terminated in accordance with their terms or of no further force and effect. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, we and Jam City also agreed, on behalf of ourselves and our respective related parties, to a release of claims relating to the Jam City Business Combination. We intend to pursue the Proposed Transaction with D-Wave described above. 
 Our Management Team 
 Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. 
 We believe our management team’s operating and transaction experience and network of relationships with investment banks, private equity firms, professional advisors and senior executives in the technology industry will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses and our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams. Our management team is also highly experienced in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.

  The past performance of our management team or their affiliates is not a guarantee of either (i) success with respect to a business combination that may be consummated or (ii) the ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction. You should not rely on the historical record of management or their affiliates as indicative of future performance. Our management has limited experience in operating blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from our management team’s expertise and proprietary global network of contacts. Our management team has a long history of investing in early stage businesses, focusing on a variety of technologies including without limitation, mobility, logistics, space, healthcare, e-commerce/retail, media and education; some of these businesses are now mature enough to benefit from the public capital markets and we believe we can leverage our management team’s breadth of experience and contacts to provide us with access to attractive business combination opportunities in these industries. Our management team has experience: 

• | managing and operating businesses in the e-commerce, social media, website creation and hosting, smart mobility, venture capital, private equity and investment banking, space and microsatellite, micromobility and transportation industries;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing and growing companies, both organically and through acquisitions and investments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | evaluating and managing the growth of new products and technologies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | identifying, recruiting and mentoring management personnel; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | sourcing, structuring, acquiring and selling businesses.
--+---------------------------------------------------------


Upon completion of our initial public offering, we began communicating with our proprietary network of relationships of our management team and their affiliates to articulate the parameters for our search for a potential target initial business combination and began the process of pursuing and reviewing potential opportunities. 
 Business Combination Criteria 
 We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We expect to conduct a comprehensive due diligence review which will include, among other things, management and employee meetings, review of financial information, facility inspection, and an extensive review of all other material target company information. We intend to use these criteria as guidelines in evaluating potential acquisition opportunities, but an acquisition may be executed even if it does not meet our guidelines. 

• | Focus on disruptive technology-related businesses with high-growth potential that will benefit from our management team’s investments, experience and contacts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We will target companies that can benefit from being publicly traded and having access to the public capital markets. We will primarily seek a target that we believe will grow and benefit from the capital investment and will be able to effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We will target businesses that are market leaders, with established technologies and attractive financial metrics or prospects, where we believe that our industry expertise and relationships can be used to create opportunities for value creation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We intend to seek target businesses that have established management teams and a strong growth trajectory that we believe could benefit from the experience and contacts of our management. While this may include businesses with a history of revenue growth and profitability, we may also target businesses that are underperforming that that we believe can benefit from our expertise or technology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe our strategy leverages our management team’s distinctive background and vast network of industry leaders in the target industry.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We believe that the unprecedented global pandemic has created once in a generation opportunities to invest in enabling technologies and innovations by companies that could benefit from our management’s experience and network and that in combination we can positively impact billions of lives, help get the world back to work, travel and leisure and schools safely and create attractive investment returns.

  These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the SEC. 
 Our Acquisition Process 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital allocation experience. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Members of our management team directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. 
 Our executive officers are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The requirement that the target business or businesses together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account is set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will continue to apply to us even if our securities are no longer listed on the NYSE. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons. However, we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as 
 
5 

  an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirements. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the common stock that are voted at a stockholder meeting held to consider such initial business combination. 
 We have until October 23, 2022 to complete our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business combination within such time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination by October 23, 2022. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
Employees 
 We currently have three officers. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.

  Our Website 
 Our corporate website address is www.dpcmcapital.com. The information contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference into this report.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements 
 We have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. Such reports and other information filed by the company with the SEC are available free of charge on our website and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The contents of these websites are not incorporated into this report. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of a prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, United States generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) or international financial reporting standards (“IFRS”), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We were required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
