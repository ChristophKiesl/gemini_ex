Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging our proprietary technology platform to design and develop a pipeline of novel oral biologic product candidates. Our proprietary technology platform allows us to exploit existing natural cellular trafficking pathways to facilitate the active transport of diverse therapeutic payloads across epithelial barriers, such as the intestinal epithelium (IE) and the respiratory epithelium (RE). Active transport is an efficient mechanism that uses the cell’s own machinery to transport materials across epithelial barriers. We believe that our ability to exploit this mechanism is a key differentiator of our approach. We currently have two oral biologics in clinical development. Our most advanced product candidate, AMT-101, has completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with chronic pouchitis and is in Phase 2 development for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our second product candidate, AMT-126 is in Phase 1 development for diseases related to IE barrier function defects.
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $61.1 million. Based on our available cash resources, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are issued. If we are unable to obtain additional funding, we will be forced to delay, reduce in scope or eliminate some of our research and development programs, including related clinical trials and operating expenses, potentially delaying the time to market for, or preventing the marketing of, any of our product candidates, which could adversely affect our business prospects and our ability to continue operations, and would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to cease operations and liquidate our assets. We may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. The report from our independent registered public accounting firm issued in connection with this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we seek additional financing to fund our business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide funding to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. To the extent that money is raised through the sale of our securities, the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our existing security holders. If we raise money through debt financing or bank loans, we may be required to secure the financing with some or all our business assets, which could be sold or retained by the creditor should we default on our payment obligations. If we fail to raise sufficient funds, we will likely need to curtail or cease operations.
We are developing oral biologic product candidates in patient-friendly dosage forms that are designed for either targeting local gastrointestinal (GI) tissue or entering systemic circulation to precisely address the relevant biology of a disease. We are building a portfolio of oral product candidates based on our technology platform including our most advanced product candidate, AMT-101, a gastrointestinal-selective oral fusion of interleukin 10 (IL-10) and our proprietary carrier molecule that has been designed for active transport across the IE barrier into local gastrointestinal (GI) tissue. IL-10 is a potent immunomodulatory cytokine that is known to be the master regulator of immune homeostasis, including within GI mucosal tissue. We have designed AMT-101 to cross the IE barrier, but not enter the bloodstream, which we believe may offer significant efficacy and safety benefits compared to systemic IL-10 administration.
In 2022, we released top-line results from the Phase 2 LOMBARD clinical trial and Phase 2 MARKET clinical trial for our lead product candidate, AMT-101, which failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoints. We also completed our FILLMORE clinical trial as a monotherapy in patients with chronic pouchitis in 2022. Additionally, based on the observation that AMT-101 can impact systemic markers of inflammation, we are conducting our CASTRO clinical trial evaluating the combination of AMT-101 and anti-TNFα therapy in patients with active RA who have had an inadequate response to anti-TNFα monotherapy.
Our second product candidate, AMT-126, is a GI-selective oral fusion of IL-22 and our proprietary carrier molecule currently in development for diseases related to IE barrier function defects. IL-22 is a cytokine that repairs functional and structural defects of the IE barrier and induces microbial defense. AMT-126 is designed to act locally on the epithelial cells of the intestinal tissue, thereby repairing the IE barrier and supporting mucosal healing, potentially translating into clinically meaningful improvements in a broad range of GI-focused, peripheral inflammatory and other diseases. While previous clinical trials conducted by others in the field with systemic rhIL-22 demonstrated efficacy in UC, significant toxicities associated with systemic administration have been observed. We have designed AMT-126 to cross the IE barrier, but not enter the bloodstream, which we believe may offer significant efficacy and safety benefits compared to systemic rhIL-22 administration.
We completed a Phase 1a clinical trial for AMT-126 in 2022 and are evaluating next steps for the clinical program.
We are developing biologic product candidates in patient-friendly dosage forms that are designed for either targeting local tissue or entering systemic circulation to precisely address the relevant biology of a disease. Our technology platform enables us to design and develop various oral and respiratory biologic therapeutic modalities, such as peptides, proteins, full-length antibodies, antibody fragments, and ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics, with potentially significant advantages over existing marketed and development-stage drugs.
Our Pipeline and Research Programs
We are leveraging our proprietary technology platform to design and develop a pipeline of oral biologic product candidates with differentiated profiles designed to address autoimmune, inflammatory, metabolic, and other diseases, as shown below. While our most advanced product candidates, AMT-101 and AMT-126, are novel, oral biologic therapeutics to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, any disease which can be treated with an oral or respiratory biologic therapeutic is conceivably a candidate for our technology. All of our early research programs have been on hold since our strategic focus announcement in May 2022. We own intellectual property rights to our technology platform and hold worldwide rights to all of our product candidates. 
Our pipeline chart is shown below in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Our Pipeline and Research Programs
Our Pipeline
AMT-101
AMT-101 is a GI-selective oral fusion of rhIL-10 and our proprietary carrier molecule. IL-10 is an immunomodulatory cytokine that is known to be the master regulator of GI mucosal homeostasis. While previous clinical trials conducted by others in the field with systemic rhIL-10 demonstrated efficacy in Crohn’s disease, significant toxicities associated with systemic administration prevented further development. We have designed AMT-101 to cross the IE barrier while not entering the bloodstream, thereby targeting the drug directly at the site of action of the underlying biology of the disease in the GI tissue and, therefore, potentially avoiding the side effects observed with systemic administration.
By design, AMT-101 is actively transported through the IE barrier into the GI tissue. In 2022, we released top-line results from the Phase 2 LOMBARD clinical trial and Phase 2 MARKET clinical trial for AMT-101, which failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoints. In November 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared our investigational new drug 
(IND) application for oral AMT-101 for the treatment of patients with chronic pouchitis. In addition, based on the observation that AMT-101 can impact systemic markers of inflammation, we are conducting our CASTRO trial evaluating the combination of AMT-101 and anti-TNFα therapy in patients with active RA who have had an inadequate response to anti-TNFα monotherapy.
AMT-126
AMT-126 is a GI-selective oral fusion of rhIL-22 and our proprietary carrier molecule currently in development for diseases related to IE barrier function defects. IL-22 is a cytokine that repairs functional and structural defects of the IE barrier and induces microbial defense. AMT-126 is designed to act locally on the epithelial cells of the intestinal tissue, thereby repairing the IE barrier and supporting mucosal healing, potentially translating into clinically meaningful improvements in a broad range of GI-focused, peripheral inflammatory and other diseases. We believe that our GI-selective AMT-126 may be safer than systemically administered treatments, because AMT-126 is designed to not enter a patient’s bloodstream, therefore avoiding the potential adverse events observed with other previously systemically administered rhIL-22 candidates. 
In preclinical development, AMT-126 demonstrated activity in animal models of intestinal inflammation, as well as the induction of markers associated with the repair of IE barrier function defects. The localization of AMT-126 in GI tissue has been further demonstrated in several preclinical studies. Despite being localized to the GI tissue, we have observed in animal models that AMT-126 can also impact systemic markers of inflammation.
By targeting AMT-126 to the IE barrier, we believe our therapy may translate to clinically meaningful reductions in disease activity. As a locally targeted, GI-selective biologic therapeutic, AMT-126 has the potential to address IE barrier function defects linked to a wide array of diseases, including celiac disease, a disease with no approved therapies, UC, Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD), and a number of peripheral diseases secondary to GI dysfunction, such as psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and other spondyloarthropathies (SpA). We completed a Phase 1a clinical trial for AMT-126 in 2022 and are evaluating next steps for the clinical program.
Research Programs
Our technology platform is enabling the generation of a pipeline of earlier-stage oral product candidates spanning multiple therapeutic areas that can either be targeted to GI tissue or released into blood for broader systemic exposure. While our most advanced product candidates, AMT-101 and AMT-126, are novel, oral biologic therapeutics to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, any disease which can be treated with an oral or respiratory biologic therapeutic is conceivably a candidate for our technology. All of our early research programs have been on hold since our strategic focus announcement in May 2022.

Our leadership is complemented by a team of researchers and biologics development experts, the majority of whom hold Ph.D., M.D., or other graduate degrees.
Our Proprietary Oral Biologics Technology Platform 
Shortcomings of Current Biologic Therapeutics 
Biologic therapeutics provide enormous therapeutic potential because of their high specificity, potency, and ability to target disease-modifying pathways. However, since the IE is a robust natural barrier for the absorption of proteins and peptides, it is difficult to deliver biologic therapeutics orally. Therefore, the systemic, injection or infusion, route is the primary route of administration for biologic therapeutics. The IE barrier represents a significant challenge for drug developers. 
The gut is the primary site of convergence of several core biology axes that impact virtually every organ system, including immunological, endocrine and neural. At any given time, over 70% of an individual’s immune system resides in the lamina propria, which is the target-rich tissue of the intestinal tract. However, the currently marketed biologic therapeutics are only able to efficiently access these key biological pathways if the therapeutics are delivered in high doses systemically. Large doses of systemically injected therapeutics could lead to toxicities because they will reach not only the targeted tissue, but also other tissues in the body. 
Our Technology Platform for Oral Biologics
We have identified a series of trafficking pathways that are used by microbes to actively transfer proteins across the IE barrier. By leveraging the natural pathways and proteins, we have demonstrated that it is possible to actively transport biologic therapeutics across the IE barrier by oral administration in animals and humans. 
Cholix is a protein secreted by Vibrio cholerae that translocates across the IE barrier of the intestine. We have identified the protein sequences along the cholix molecule responsible for trafficking across the IE barrier and targeting immune cells in the GI tissue. This mechanism is based on active, receptor-mediated processes that naturally transport proteins. Our proprietary technology platform creates a fusion protein containing engineered protein translocation sequences of cholix (the AMT carrier) and any protein of interest, which we refer to as the therapeutic payload, to create a novel biologic that can be transported across the IE barrier. Trafficking across IE cells is an active transport process involving uptake at the luminal surface, movement of vesicles through the cells, and release at the basal surface, that utilize dynamic interactions with endogenous elements of the cell. 
Figure 2 illustrates the distinction between our proprietary active transport approach and that of traditional passive diffusion approaches. 
Figure 2. Distinction between our proprietary active transport approach and passive diffusion
Figure 3 illustrates our ability to leverage the translocation mechanism of cholix and either actively target the biologic therapeutics to the GI tissue or enter into systemic circulation to precisely address the relevant biology of a disease.

Advantages of our Technology Platform 
Our technology platform establishes a new paradigm to orally deliver biologic therapeutics. We believe that AMT-101 has demonstrated clinical proof of concept for our technology platform by enabling the active transport and rapid absorption of an orally-administered biologic therapeutic. We believe that our technology offers several advantages: 
•Active transport across the IE barrier: Most strategies that have tried to deliver biologic therapeutics orally have focused on passive diffusion across the IE barrier or the use of permeation enhancers to open tight junctions in order to increase permeability through paracellular spaces. In contrast, our technology actively transports the payload through the cell in a receptor and vesicular-mediated process which is beneficial because of the higher transport efficiency and ability to apply our technology to a wide range of therapeutic modalities. All of our product candidates, including AMT-101 and AMT-126, are actively transported. 
•Flexibility of therapeutic modalities: We have demonstrated our ability to deliver peptides, proteins, full-length antibodies, antibody fragments, and RNA therapeutics using our technology platform. This diversity of payloads increases the number of therapeutic opportunities where our technology can be deployed. Our current programs capitalize on the breadth of our technology which includes proteins (AMT-101, AMT-126 and hGH), peptides (GLP-1 and GLP-2), and full-length antibodies. 
•Targeting local GI tissue or entering into systemic circulation: When designing our product candidates, we can target the therapeutic payload to the lamina propria of the local GI tissue. This is particularly beneficial for immunology and GI disorders because the intestinal tissue is the largest immune organ in the body, housing greater than 70% of the body’s immune cells. Our most advanced product candidates, AMT-101 and AMT-126, are designed to target the local GI tissue. Alternatively, we can design our product candidates to enter into the bloodstream for systemic exposure after crossing the IE barrier. For example, we have designed our research-stage hGH program for systemic exposure and have demonstrated in multiple preclinical models that hGH can enter systemic circulation using our technology platform. The flexibility of our technology platform allows us to target diseases localized to the GI tissue or diseases where having the product circulating systemically is critical. 
•Rapid uptake in the intestinal tract: We have demonstrated in vivo that the translocation of a biologic therapeutic coupled to the AMT carrier can occur rapidly and the protein can be localized in the submucosal space within 20 minutes. All of our product candidates are rapidly absorbed by the intestinal tract within 10 to 30 minutes after exposure to the epithelial surface. 
•Ease of biologic therapeutic production: Our product candidates are conveniently synthesized recombinantly using standard bacterial or mammalian manufacturing processes. This allows us to employ traditional expression and optimization strategies to produce the therapeutic protein. Alternatively, if a product candidate contains a payload with non-natural amino acids and/or chemical modifications, we can produce the AMT carrier recombinantly and chemically conjugate the modified payload to create the product candidate. 
Beyond the active transport capabilities of our proprietary technology platform, we also utilize several other technologies to ensure our products are protected in the GI environment and released at the appropriate location of the intestine. We have employed enteric coating techniques using off the shelf polymers and excipients that are considered safe for use by regulatory authorities. Our product candidates can be released at various points in the intestine for optimal uptake such as at the terminal ileum, which is part of the small bowel, or along the colon. In a scintigraphy trial in human subjects, we evaluated the release profile of various formulations using capsules of our enteric-coated formulations where we used a radiolabeled tracer instead of active drug product. As shown in Figure 4, the formulated capsule remained intact until it reached the terminal ileum, where it began to dissolve and release its contents. We have developed other formulations that allow our product candidates to be released at various other regions along the GI tract. 
Figure 4. Human intestinal tract scintigraphy images demonstrating GI transit and location-specific release of our proprietary formulated capsule
The outlined regions in the two images to the left (2.3 and 2.5 hours) represent the stomach, whereas the outlined regions in the two images to the right (3.5 and 5.5 hours) represent the colon. This demonstrates in the clinic our ability to target drug to a desired location along the GI tract. 
Our ability to deliver biologic therapeutics with our oral technology platform provides several potential advantages over systemically administered biologics and oral products that are also GI-selective. These attributes are designed to achieve the following benefits: 
•Improving Efficacy: Our oral biologic therapeutics provide significant therapeutic potential because of their high potency and ability to locally target the GI tract and access key biological pathways. In contrast to our oral technology platform, systemically administered biologics often cannot achieve the appropriate therapeutic dose levels because of dose-limiting toxicities. 
•Improving Safety: GI-selective products may have safety advantages relative to systemically administered drugs because the biologic payload has minimal exposure to systemic circulation. In contrast, systemically administered drugs result in undesirably high levels of drugs in tissues which were not intended to be targeted. By minimizing off-target safety liabilities, our product candidates have the potential to be used in a more versatile manner, either as a single agent or in combination with other therapies. We believe that in light of current events caused by pandemic infection, there is a heightened need for non-systemic, locally-acting immunomodulators that are distinct from immuno-suppressive drugs. 
•More Patient-Friendly: When compared to systemically administered biologics delivered by injection or infusion, we expect oral dosage forms to enhance compliance and quality of life of patients and caregivers. 
Our Product Candidates: AMT-101 and AMT-126 
We have leveraged our proprietary technology platform to design and develop a pipeline of oral biologic product candidates with differentiated profiles designed to address autoimmune, inflammatory, metabolic, and other diseases. AMT-101 is a GI-selective oral fusion of our proprietary carrier molecule and rhIL-10. AMT-126 is a GI-selective oral fusion of our proprietary carrier molecule and rhIL-22.
AMT-101: Our Oral GI-Selective IL-10 Fusion Protein 
Our most advanced product candidate, AMT-101, is a recombinant fusion of rhIL-10 and the engineered protein translocation sequences of cholix. In 2022, we released top-line results from the Phase 2 LOMBARD clinical trial and Phase 2 MARKET clinical trial for AMT-101, which failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoints. We have completed the FILLMORE Phase 2 clinical trial as a monotherapy in patients with chronic pouchitis. Additionally, based on the observation that AMT-101 can impact systemic markers of inflammation, we have initiated and dosed patients in the CASTRO Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of AMT-101 and anti-TNFα therapy in patients with active RA who have had an inadequate response to anti-TNFα monotherapy. Oral AMT-101 is designed to act locally in the intestinal lamina propria tissue to modulate immune pathways along GI tissue and control inflammation, resulting in clinical and symptomatic improvement. We believe oral AMT-101 may have safety advantages compared to systemically administered treatments, including prior clinical evaluation of rhIL-10, because AMT-101 is designed to not enter a patient’s bloodstream. Targeted localization of AMT-101 to the GI tissue lamina propria is expected to translate into clinically meaningful reductions in inflammation and disease activity. Figure 5 below shows the molecular structure of AMT-101. 
Figure 5. Molecular Structure of AMT-101
Overview of IL-10 Biology 
IL-10 is a potent immunomodulatory cytokine that is known to be the master regulator of GI mucosal tissue immune homeostasis. IL-10 regulates the activation and effector function of multiple innate and adaptive immune cells and upregulates cytokine inhibitors (e.g., soluble TNF-receptor and IL-1Ra). The binding of IL-10 to its receptor activates the IL-10/JAK1/STAT3 cascade, a key pathway in modulating inflammation, where phosphorylated STAT3 homodimers translocate to the nucleus to activate the expression of target genes to promote cellular protection, survival, and proliferation. 
Preclinical and Translational Science Support for Treatment of IBD with IL-10 
Support for the use of rhIL-10 in the treatment of IBD has been reinforced by the preclinical studies in IL-10 knockout mice in which the absence of IL-10 leads to spontaneous signs of intestinal inflammation as early as three weeks of age. The symptoms 
progress into chronic transmural inflammation of the large and small bowels that resemble Crohn’s disease, which can be alleviated with IL-10 treatment. 
IL-10 has been identified in human genome wide-association preclinical studies as being associated with risk factors for IBD, further demonstrating the genetic contribution to disease pathogenesis. Moreover, polymorphisms in the IL-10 receptor and loss-of-function mutations in IL-10 or the IL-10 receptor are associated with early onset of disease for UC and Crohn’s disease, respectively. 
Clinical Support for Treatment of IBD with IL-10 
rhIL-10 has been evaluated as a systemically administered agent in clinical trials in healthy volunteers and patients with IBD. Prior clinical trials with rhIL-10 in Crohn’s disease demonstrated a trend towards clinical improvement. However, systemically administered rhIL-10 treatment was associated with adverse events and loss of response at higher doses. Certain clinical trials exhibited induction of severe anemia and thrombocytopenia believed to have been caused by broad systemic exposure of rhIL-10. In addition to the observed toxicities, systemically administered rhIL-10 is thought to have resulted in intestinal IL-10 concentrations that were insufficient to down-regulate inflammation. We believe that IL-10 targeted to the local site of inflammation may offer optimal therapeutic benefit and avoid the safety issues observed in systemic administration. 
Potential Benefits and Positioning of AMT-101, Our IL-10 Program 
We believe AMT-101 has the potential to offer clinical benefits in GI diseases, as well as in peripheral inflammatory indications such as RA. We have initially developed AMT-101 for chronic pouchitis and will further explore the potential clinical benefits of AMT-101 for other GI diseases. We have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial as a monotherapy for chronic pouchitis, and an orphan GI inflammatory disease with no approved therapies. 
IL-10 is a potent immunomodulator that has shown preliminary efficacy in Crohn’s disease patients when administered systemically, though with serious adverse events caused by the systemic exposure of rhIL-10. Oral AMT-101 has the potential to unlock the full therapeutic potential of rhIL-10 therapy because it is actively transported to immunomodulatory pathways in the local GI tissue and is designed to not enter a patient’s bloodstream, so it is not expected to have the safety issues of previous systemic rhIL-10 therapies. 
Due to its potentially attractive safety profile and immunomodulatory mechanism, AMT-101 has an opportunity to potentially be used as a single agent or in combination with other therapies for IBD and other inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, we have initiated a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with RA as the evidence of immunomodulatory effects observed in the peripheral circulation in our Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and patients with active UC suggests that AMT-101 has the potential to be used beyond GI disorders in peripheral inflammatory indications. 
AMT-101 is formulated to be available in a convenient, oral, once-a-day tablet.
Market Opportunity—Chronic Pouchitis 
In patients who have had a colectomy for refractory UC disease, ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is a common procedure to create a pouch for patients’ stool. Patients who have an IPAA typically have four to eight bowel movements per day, but the most common complication among patients who have undergone an IPAA is pouchitis, an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition. It is estimated that approximately 50-60% of patients who have undergone IPAA surgery for UC will develop at least one episode of pouchitis in the next decade. Pouchitis leads to increased stool frequency and liquidity, cramping, urgency, fecal incontinence, and occasional rectal bleeding. It has been estimated that approximately 30,000 to 45,000 patients have pouchitis in the United States. 
While the majority of patients with acute pouchitis respond well to a short course of antibiotics, some patients develop chronic and refractory disease that requires long-term non-antibiotic therapy. Currently, there are no therapies approved for pouchitis and chronic refractory patients will be treated with budesonide, anti-inflammatory drugs (mesalamine, sulfasalazine), or immunosuppressive drugs (other steroids or anti-TNFα). There is a significant unmet medical need to develop products for patients who develop severe chronic pouchitis. 
Summary of Our AMT-101 Data 
Through our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, we have observed that AMT-101 acts on the local immunological pathways along the GI tissue. Importantly, AMT-101 did not enter the bloodstream. We believe that AMT-101 has demonstrated PoC for our technology platform by enabling the active transport and rapid absorption of an orally-administered biologic therapeutic.
Summary of Our AMT-101 Clinical Data 
AMT-101 Phase 1a/b Clinical Trial 
The AMT-101 Phase 1a/1b was a double-blinded clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of orally administered AMT-101 monotherapy, first in a single ascending dose (SAD) trial in healthy volunteers followed by a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study over 14 days in patients with active ulcerative colitis. In the Phase 1a SAD study, a wide range of doses were tested: 1 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, and 120 mg. Healthy volunteers were randomized 4:2 active to placebo for the single oral administration. Overall, AMT-101 appeared well tolerated with only 3 mild adverse events and no serious adverse events (SAEs). The Phase 1b MAD trial randomized UC patients in a 3:1 active to placebo manner for treatment over 14 days. MAD doses of 1 mg, 3 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg were tested. Overall, AMT-101 appeared well tolerated with no SAEs or early terminations. To understand pharmacodynamic effect in a UC patient population, clinically validated biomarkers of fecal calprotectin (FC) and c-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated to measure percentage change from baseline. Overall, mean reductions of both FC and CRP occurred in the 1 mg, 3 mg, and 10 mg doses with placebo adjusted FC and CRP reduction in the 3 mg dose of approximately 27% and 10%, respectively. These observations, along with exploratory central-read histologic tissue evaluation utilizing the Geboes scoring system formed the basis for the selection of 3 mg and 10 mg as doses to advance to further Phase 2 testing.
AMT-101 Phase 2 Clinical Trials
FILLMORE
FILLMORE was a Phase 2 double-blinded clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of orally administered AMT-101 monotherapy, over 12 weeks, in patients with chronic pouchitis. The FILLMORE trial randomized 22 patients to 3 mg or 10 mg of oral AMT-101. The clinical trial was designed to measure two key pre-specified efficacy endpoints: 1) symptomatic improvement, as measured by stool frequency response, and 2) histologic healing, as measured by central read. On the first measure, results from the trial demonstrated that 36.4% (8/22) of patients achieved stool frequency response, defined as a reduction of ≥ 3 stools and ≥ 30% from baseline, OR ≤ post-colectomy normal. On the second measure, 22.7% (5/22) of patients met the pre-specified histologic healing response of Geboes score ≤ 3.1, an objective assessment of disease improvement. FILLMORE patients had a median baseline Geboes score of 5.1, representing severe pouchitis with ulceration and tissue destruction. Both dosage groups demonstrated histologic healing response. Combined results of stool frequency response across both arms was 36.4% (8/22) and combined rates of histologic response was 22.7% (5/22). AMT-101 appeared well tolerated.
MARKET
MARKET was a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in which 51 patients were randomized to adalimumab alone or the combination of adalimumab + 3 mg AMT-101 for 8 weeks. Overall, the combination arm achieved a clinical remission rate of 31.8% (7/22) versus 33.3% (9/27) in the adalimumab alone arm. Although the combination arm did not exhibit superiority over adalimumab alone, AMT-101 appeared well tolerated.
LOMBARD
LOMBARD was a 12 week Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in which 105 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 3 mg AMT-101 versus placebo. Overall rates of clinical remission, the key efficacy endpoint were 17.1% (12/70) in the AMT-101 arm versus 20.0% (7/35) in the placebo arm. Although AMT-101 failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoints, AMT-101 appeared well tolerated.
AMT-101 Phase 2 Clinical Program 
We are conducting a Phase 2 clinical program for AMT-101 that includes our FILLMORE trial as a monotherapy in patients with chronic pouchitis. Additionally, based on the observation that AMT-101 can impact systemic markers of inflammation, we are conducting our CASTRO trial evaluating the combination of AMT-101 and anti-TNFα therapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate response to anti-TNFα monotherapy.
Figure 6 provides additional information related to our Phase 2 clinical trials for AMT-101.
Figure 6. Phase 2 clinical trials for AMT-101
AMT-126: Our Oral GI-Selective IL-22 Fusion Protein 
Our second product candidate, AMT-126, is a GI-selective oral fusion of rhIL-22 and our proprietary carrier molecule currently in development for diseases related to GI tissue barrier function defects. IL-22 is a cytokine that repairs functional and structural defects of the IE barrier and induces microbial defense. AMT-126 is designed to act locally on the epithelial cells of the intestinal tissue, thereby repairing the IE barrier and supporting mucosal healing, potentially translating into clinically meaningful improvements in a broad range of GI-focused, peripheral inflammatory and other diseases. We believe AMT-126 may have safety advantages relative to systemically administered IBD treatments, including prior clinical evaluation of rhIL-22, because AMT-101 is designed to stay in the GI tissue and not enter a patient’s bloodstream. 
In preclinical development, AMT-126 demonstrated activity in animal models of intestinal inflammation, as well as induction of local tissue and systemic effects associated with the repair of IE barrier function defects. The localization of AMT-126 in GI tissue has been further demonstrated in NHP preclinical studies. As a locally targeted, GI-selective biologic therapeutic, AMT-126 has the potential to address IE barrier function defects linked to a wide array of diseases, including celiac disease, a disease with no approved medicines, UC, and a number of peripheral diseases secondary to GI dysfunction, such as psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and other spondyloarthropathies (SpA). We have initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for AMT-126 similar to that which we conducted with AMT-101 including a Phase 1a single ascending dose in healthy volunteers to be followed by a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose in healthy patients with an indication associated with intestinal barrier defects. 
Figure 7 shows the molecular structure of AMT-126. 
Figure 7. Molecular structure of AMT-126
The Role of IL-22 Biology in IE Barrier Function Defect Correction 
IL-22 is a cytokine that repairs functional and structural defects of the IE barrier and induces microbial defense by counteracting inflammasome-driven IE barrier function defects. IL-22 also functions to promote cell proliferation, block apoptosis, and support wound healing. While IL-22 can have a variety of actions on the structural and functional properties of the intestine, the most critical action related to health and disease relates to maintenance of the IE barrier. For example, in celiac disease, gliadin-induced IE barrier function defects of the small intestine appear to be correlated with a reduction of IL-22 in a NHP model. In addition, depletion of IL-22-producing CD4+ cells is correlated with active disease in UC models. 
Potential Benefits of AMT-126, Our IL-22 Program 
We believe AMT-126 may have a profile that will make it compelling to develop for IE barrier function defects linked to a wide array of diseases including celiac disease, UC and others. IL-22 has a mechanism of action that is directed at disturbances in the IE barrier function, which is central to these diseases. There are currently no approved therapies focused on the repair of IE barrier function. 
We have designed AMT-126 to act locally on the GI tissue while avoiding entering the patient’s bloodstream, which we believe will mitigate previously reported adverse effects associated with systemic IL-22 treatments. 
Due to its potentially attractive safety profile and complementary mechanism of action with those of anti-inflammatory products, we believe AMT-126 has the potential to be used as a single agent or in combination with anti-inflammatory products. 
AMT-126 will be formulated to be available in a convenient, once daily, oral dosage form. 
Summary of Our AMT-126 Preclinical Data 
AMT-126 Shows Highly Comparable Bioactivity to rhIL-22 in Established Models of In Vitro Pharmacology 
AMT-126 was evaluated to determine in vitro bioactivity. As shown in Figure 8, IL-22 receptor dimerization and STAT3 activation confirmed ligand-dependent activation of the IL-22 signaling pathway that was highly comparable to multiple sources of rhIL-22. Furthermore, the AMT carrier by itself demonstrated no bioactivity.

Oral AMT-126 Shows Efficacy in a Murine Dextran Sulphate Sodium (DSS) Induced Model of UC 
In a murine DSS-induced UC model to assess the activity of oral AMT-126, oral dosing of AMT-126 reduced DSS-induced weight loss and fecal hemoccult, and improved stool consistency during the course of the clinical trial.

Oral AMT-126 Shows Systemic Pharmacological Effects with Low Systemic Exposures
AMT-126 was administered by oral capsules in a non-disease NHP model and, by design, showed minimal (pg/ml) levels in the systemic circulation. Although AMT-126 is intended to stay in the GI tissue, we observed systemic induction of Reg3A and IL-1Ra (Figure 10). This effect demonstrates the ability of oral GI-selective AMT-126 to induce effects along GI tissue that impact both local and systemic biology, but without meaningful systemic exposure. We believe oral AMT-126, as a gut selective therapy, could have the same, if not greater, efficacy as systemic IL-22, but may also have an enhanced safety profile due to minimal systemic levels of IL-22. Furthermore, the systemic induction of IL-1Ra suggests a broader role for oral GI-selective AMT-126 in peripheral diseases secondary to GI dysfunction.

AMT-126 Phase 1 Clinical Programs
We completed the Phase 1a clinical trial for AMT-126 in 2022 and are evaluating next steps for the clinical program.
Research Programs 
Our technology platform is enabling the generation of a pipeline of earlier-stage oral product candidates spanning multiple therapeutic areas that can either be targeted to GI tissue or released into blood for broader systemic exposure. While our most advanced product candidates, AMT-101 and AMT-126, are novel, oral biologic therapeutics to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, any disease which can be treated with an oral or respiratory biologic therapeutic is conceivably a candidate for our technology. 
All of our early research programs have been on hold since our strategic focus announcement in May 2022.
Manufacturing 
We believe that developing our own manufacturing capacity and capability is important to limit our reliance on contract manufacturers, protect our trade secrets and intellectual property, and improve our manufacturing processes. We have spent and continue to spend significant resources developing our current manufacturing processes, capabilities, and know-how. We have commissioned our new GMP manufacturing facility located in South San Francisco where we now manufacture clinical drug supply. We have successfully manufactured clinical supply at our previous GMP facility also located in South San Francisco. We will also continue to rely on third-party current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) manufacturers for certain manufacturing steps of our product candidates for clinical supply. We have established non-exclusive relationships with several contract manufacturers, for the manufacturing of various intermediates and finished product candidates. We have personnel with significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality, regulatory, cGMP, and project management experience to execute our internal manufacturing capabilities, oversee our third-party manufacturers, and to manage manufacturing and quality data and information for regulatory compliance purposes.
Commercialization Plan 
We do not currently have any approved drugs and we do not expect to have any approved drugs in the near term. Therefore, we have no sales, marketing, or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company in marketing drugs. When, and if any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization, we intend to develop a commercialization infrastructure for those products in the United States, Europe, Asia, and potentially in certain other key markets. We may also rely on partnerships to provide commercialization infrastructure, including sales and marketing and commercial distribution. 
Competition 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities and other academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of therapies aimed at treating autoimmune, inflammatory, metabolic, and other diseases. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
In particular, with respect to our most advanced product candidates, AMT-101 and AMT-126, we compete against companies that produce injectable biologic therapeutics such as AbbVie Inc., Amgen Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Eli Lilly and Co., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., Roche Holding Ltd., Prometheus Biosciences, Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd., as well as companies that produce oral products such as Abivax SA, Amgen Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Dice Therapeutics Inc, Galapagos NV, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Landos Biopharma, Inc., Morphic Holding, Inc., Pfizer Inc., Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc., and Ventyx Biosciences, Inc.
We are not aware of any other company or organization that has developed a FDA-approved oral biologic, other than peptides. However, we are aware of other companies developing oral biologic drug candidates using their own technology platform. 
Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, 
biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling subjects for our clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop, including if competitors develop a safer and/or more effective oral biologic technology platform. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, if required, the level of biosimilar or generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our strategy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover our product candidates and related components, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trademarks as well as trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology platform, and product candidates. We believe that we have substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our technology and product candidates. 
As of February 10, 2023, our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications related to our technology platform and our product candidates. In total, our patent portfolio includes 125 U.S. and foreign issued patents and over 130 other pending patent applications. Foreign patents are granted in the following jurisdictions: Europe (validated in Germany, France, United Kingdom, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Turkey, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Slovakia, and Slovenia), Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Philippines, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and India. The technology platform filings include 96 issued patents and at least 70 pending applications. Certain platform filings are expected to expire as early as 2031. Other filings directed to platform technology are expected to expire as early as 2039.
In addition to platform filings, we have filings directed to specific product candidates. For our product candidates, we generally pursue multilayered patent protection covering the composition of matter including the sequence of the product candidates, the formulations of the product candidates, and/or the functional characteristics of the product candidates. In addition to composition of matter coverage, we also generally pursue claims directed to methods of making, and methods of use of the product candidates. Filings specific to AMT-101 and AMT-126 are expected to expire in 2040 or 2039. 
Government Regulation 
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory authorities of the countries in which we wish to conduct preclinical studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. 
U.S. Biologics Regulation 
The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices regulation; 
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 
•approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced; 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose; 
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (BLA) after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with current good clinical practices (cGCP); and 
•FDA review and approval of a BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 
Preclinical and Clinical Development 
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of preclinical animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the clinical trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some preclinical studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a clinical trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. 
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. 
•Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These clinical trials are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, to identify possible side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
•Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. We expect to conduct four Phase 2 clinical trials to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
•Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 clinical trials may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional preclinical animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested. Stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
Since March 2020, the FDA has issued various COVID-19 related guidance documents for sponsors and manufacturers, including guidance documents regarding conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, Good Manufacturing Practices, remote interactive evaluations of drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring facilities, and drug product manufacturing and supply chain inspections, among others. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations is uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments, including new regulatory requirements and changes to existing regulations. Recently, President Biden announced that the administration intends to end the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023. The full impact of the termination of the public health emergencies on FDA and other regulatory policies and operations is unclear.
BLA Submission and Review 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure, and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing clinical trials. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
A product intended to treat patients with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. 
Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review). 
Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. In December 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, including the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA), was signed into law. FDORA made several changes to the FDA’s authorities and its regulatory framework, including, among other changes, reforms to the accelerated approval pathway, such as requiring the FDA to specify conditions for post-approval study requirements and setting forth procedures for the FDA to withdraw a product on an expedited basis for non-compliance with post-approval requirements. 
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
Orphan Drug Designation 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat patients with a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. In November 2022, AMT-101 was granted orphan drug designation in patients with pouchitis. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. 
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
In Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease. In particular, the circuit court held that the orphan-drug exclusivity for Catalyst’s drug blocked FDA’s approval of another drug for all uses or indications within the same orphan-designated disease, or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), even though Catalyst’s drug was approved at that time only for use in the treatment of LEMS in adults. Accordingly, the court ordered the FDA to set aside the approval of a drug indicated for LEMS in children. This decision created uncertainty in the application of the orphan drug exclusivity. On January 24, 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court’s order in Catalyst, FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order – that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity. 
Post-approval Requirements 
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to cGMP, quality controls, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market clinical 
trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals; 
•product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; 
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, potential civil and criminal penalties, government investigation, and/or debarment or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine by physicians or their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, regulate manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. 
Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity 
The ACA includes a subtitle called the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. 
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency and that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, which can be demonstrated through comparative analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient or that it can be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of a health care provider who prescribed the reference product, and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars 
approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. 
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact and implementation of the BPCIA are subject to significant uncertainty. 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the Sunshine Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and similar foreign, federal and state fraud and abuse, transparency, and health information privacy and security laws. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including stock options. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Our activities, including our engagement of consultants, may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of an applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all relevant facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, can result in a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. 
Civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free products or other illegal kickbacks to customers to induce customers to refer or use the companies’ products over competitors’ products or alternative treatments that were billed to federal healthcare programs for reimbursement for the products. 
The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered prescription drugs, devices, biologics or medical supplies subject to FDA approval or clearance for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to certain payments and other transfers of value made in the previous year to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others), teaching hospitals, and information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. In addition, HIPAA, as amended the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses, and health plans, as well as individuals and entities, known as business associates, that provide services for or on behalf of the covered entities that involve individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, we may be subject to state and foreign anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
In the event of any actual or alleged failure to comply with any of these or other laws or regulations, we may face investigations and other proceedings by governmental authorities and claims and litigation by private parties in certain circumstances. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, or if we settle any claims or proceedings relating to any such laws or regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities, including, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participating in government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, government investigations, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and market share, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product, if approved, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage policy, formulary, and reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific, clinical, and/or cost-effectiveness support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. 
For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. 
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
Healthcare Reform 
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing. 
The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, a new licensure framework for follow on biologic products, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. There have been executive, legislative and judicial challenges to certain aspects of the ACA since its enactment. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) was enacted, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, effective January 1, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a Texas District Court Judge ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. However, in June 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how future challenges to the ACA and healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact the ACA, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional action is taken by Congress. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments can vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester.
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.
For example, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. The impact of these regulations and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the government on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products.
