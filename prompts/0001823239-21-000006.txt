Item 1. Business
Overview
Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (also referred to in this document as “Maravai”, “Pubco”, “we”, “us” or “the Company”) is a leading life sciences company providing critical products to enable the development of drug therapies, diagnostics, novel vaccines and support research on human diseases. Our more than 5,200 customers as of December 31, 2020 include the top 20 global biopharmaceutical companies ranked by research and development expenditures according to industry consultants, and many other emerging biopharmaceutical and life sciences research companies, as well as leading academic research institutions and in vitro diagnostics companies. Our products address the key phases of biopharmaceutical development and include complex nucleic acids for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, antibody-based products to detect impurities during the production of biopharmaceutical products, and products to detect the expression of proteins in tissues of various species.
Our businesses principally address high growth market segments in biopharmaceutical development that are growing at a weighted average blended rate of 20% per annum. In particular, the field of cell and gene therapy has emerged as one of the fastest growing treatment modalities to address a host of human conditions. There are more than 400 cell and gene therapies in development or launched and sales in this category are expected to grow more than tenfold by 2024, according to industry consultants and management estimates. Our portfolio offers key products for each stage of the cell and gene therapy development lifecycle. For example, our mRNA products are used in drug development to assist in the production of immune-activating antigens; our CleanCap® technology is used to stabilize mRNA and streamlines mRNA manufacturing; and our plasmid DNA products are used as templates for the production of our RNA products. We also provide biologics safety testing technology used to ensure the safety of the biological drug manufacturing process and drug products. We have relationships with the following categories of customers (percentages represent the share of revenue in each category for the year ended December 31, 2020): developers of therapeutics and vaccines (66%), other biopharmaceutical and life science research companies (27%), academic institutions (4%) and molecular diagnostic companies (3%).
Our proprietary capabilities and products underpin the value we aim to provide to our customers. Among other capabilities, we are experts in RNA and mRNA products, which are challenging and often unstable molecules requiring significant chemical modifications to ensure their stability and efficacy in our customers’ applications. Notably, according to research commissioned by us consisting of over 70 interviews with our current and former customers, our competitors and industry experts focused across our three business segments (the “Industry Analysis”), we believe CleanCap® is viewed as a leading solution to incorporate the 5’ cap into mRNA. CleanCap® is a novel chemical approach to produce the 5’ cap analog, which, in addition to making mRNA more stable, aids in protein production and helps prevent an unwanted immune response to the mRNA. As of December 31, 2020, CleanCap® had been used by over 110 customers as a stand-alone reagent and had been incorporated into several development programs targeting immunization against the novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID-19”). We also work with over 400 customers who use our CleanCap® technology through our custom mRNA services and catalog mRNA in support of their research and pre-clinical work. These programs included two commercial programs led by Pfizer in partnership with BioNTech and the other led by BioNTech in partnership with Fosun Pharma, one phase I clinical program led

by Chulalongkorn University, one phase I/II clinical programs led by Imperial College London, and one phase III program led by CureVac, and three pre-clinical programs led by the University of Tokyo in partnership with Daiichi-Sankyo, eTheRNA Immunotherapies and Greenlight Biosciences. Given the early stage of these three programs, there can be no assurance they will continue to use CleanCap® through commercialization. We estimate our mRNA and CleanCap® products have also been incorporated in at least 40 therapeutic programs in development as of December 31, 2020. These therapeutic programs address a number of disease states, including ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, glycogen storage disorders, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hurler syndrome, ovarian cancer and cardiovascular disease. These therapeutic programs also use multiple therapeutic modalities, including CRISPR/Cas-9, transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALENS), enzyme replacement therapies, allogeneic CAR-T cells and base editing. Should one or more of these programs proceed to commercialization, we believe we will continue to supply our customers and our products will likely be incorporated in customer regulatory filings. Additionally, The FDA recently issued policies on February 22, 2021 to guide medical product developers concerning the development of products to address the future of variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus specifically covering vaccines and therapeutics. We believe this guidance may streamline the future development and approval of mRNA vaccines utilizing our products and that they would likely be incorporated into customer regulatory filings.
mRNA is at the core of our capabilities. We developed our expertise in mRNA with a belief in its potential as a therapeutic modality. The first clinical trial for an mRNA therapeutic agent occurred in 2016. More than 30 clinical trials have occurred since then, principally focused on vaccines against viruses and cancer vaccines. With the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA has shown its potential for more rapid vaccine design and manufacture when compared to traditional techniques involving culturing inactivated virus to elicit an immune response. According to the World Health Organization, there were 263 COVID-19 vaccine development programs as of March 9, 2021, with two candidates approved in the RNA class and some additional RNA lead candidates for approval with anticipated program data readouts, including results of preclinical studies and phase I/II and phase III clinical trials. COVID-19 has helped highlight the potential advantage of mRNA as a treatment modality and directed significant resources to the developing base of knowledge about mRNA. We believe this knowledge will be directed at future vaccine programs as well as therapeutic agents for a host of human diseases. We are positioned to serve our biopharmaceutical customers in the fast-growing field of mRNA across a range of clinical programs for a variety of diseases. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 47% of our revenue was derived from products that support mRNA research.
Forming long-term partnerships with our customers is core to our strategy. We primarily serve our customers during the product development and process development phases. During product development, we collaborate with our customers to develop and synthesize nucleic acids, which in some cases comprise the APIs of our customers’ products in development. We also provide our customers a host of chemically complex and highly specialized raw materials. Process development is a complex phase that establishes highly validated procedures and determines the investment in facilities and equipment required to bring biopharmaceutical products to market. These decisions impact the viability of our customers’ products for the long-term. During process development, we provide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (“ELISAs”) that reduce the risk posed by impurities and contaminants in biological drugs, a critical step to ensure the safety of the drug product.
While we do not provide products that are themselves regulated as drugs or in vitro diagnostics, our customers frequently incorporate our products into their highly validated products and processes. For example, we provide oligonucleotides and antibody-based products used by in vitro diagnostic product manufacturers for their on-market products. Because of the extensive validation required for these products, these components are frequently purchased for the life of our customers’ products and we believe they are unlikely to be substituted. In addition, our analytical tools are used in the design and development of manufacturing processes and often will be used throughout the life cycle of our customers’ manufactured products. As a result, our customer relationships may span many years.
The nature of our products and their uses require that they be manufactured by highly trained personnel in state-of-the-art facilities following exacting procedures to ensure quality. We manufacture our nucleic acid products at our San Diego, California facility, one of four facilities we occupy in the United States. The facility was purpose-built to address our customers’ needs for critical raw materials manufactured under certain good manufacturing practices (“GMP”) conditions and APIs for investigational use. Our raw material products are manufactured following the voluntary quality standards of ISO 9001:2015. Our GMP-grade raw materials follow ISO 9001:2015 standards, additional voluntary GMP quality standards and customer specific requirements. Our API products are manufactured following the voluntary quality standards of ISO 9001:2015, the International Council for Harmonisation’s GMP Guide, comparable GMP principles for the European Union and customer specific requirements. We believe our products are exempt from compliance with the current GMP (“cGMP”) regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), as our products are further processed or incorporated into final drug products by our customers and we do not make claims related to their safety or effectiveness. As of December 31, 2020, we have invested $75.0 million in our San Diego facility. Our other facilities are similarly designed for specific applications with quality systems to match our customers’ requirements. All of our facilities meet applicable ISO standards. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 20% of our workforce have earned advanced degrees and all receive rigorous training.

We built our business through a combination of acquisitions and subsequent investments in our acquired companies to grow their commercial capabilities, upgrade and expand their research and production facilities, deploy stringent quality systems, integrate their back-office functions, and develop the personnel and management to fuel continued growth. Today, we offer an integrated portfolio that enables innovation across the biopharmaceutical and academic markets. We completed our first acquisition in April 2016. The trailing twelve-month revenue of each of our acquired businesses at the time we acquired each of them totaled approximately $85.0 million. Mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships that complement our capabilities in cell and gene therapy and biopharmaceutical production remain core to our strategy. Our strategy aims to augment our strong organic growth with the addition of synergistic products and capabilities.
Our Portfolio and Capabilities
We provide products that support our customers’ needs from discovery through commercialization of their vaccines, therapeutic agents and in vitro diagnostic products. Our products are frequently incorporated into our customers’ products, whether as research products or APIs used in development or research products incorporated as raw materials into on-market products. They may also be incorporated into the manufacturing process itself. We are therefore a critical part of our customers’ supply chain and they frequently seek to maintain their supply relationship with us for the life of their products or development programs.
Our products address our customers’ needs for nucleic acid production, biologics safety testing and protein detection, and our operations are aligned to these three segments. 
*Our plasmid DNA products launched in Q1 2021

The growth in our nucleic acid production business segment has been fueled by the significant growth in biological drugs in development, many of which are addressing cell and gene therapies, and by the rapid rise in mRNA vaccines. mRNA as a treatment modality has been an area of acute interest for several years. The global COVID-19 pandemic, however, has demonstrated its potential advantages in speed of development and manufacturing, as well as cost. Of the estimated 263 COVID-19 vaccine development programs underway as of March 9, 2021, according to the World Health Organization, 34 are mRNA-based. Five of the 34, including two commercial programs led by Pfizer in partnership with BioNTech and the other led by BioNTech in partnership with Fosun Pharma, one phase I clinical program led by Chulalongkorn University, one phase I/II clinical programs led by Imperial College London and , one phase III program led by CureVac use our CleanCap® products and up to three more in early stages of development, led by the University of Tokyo in partnership with Daiichi-Sankyo, eTheRNA Immunotherapies and Greenlight Biosciences, are currently using our CleanCap® products. Given the early stage of these 3 programs, there can be no assurance they will continue to use CleanCap® through commercialization. 
We further serve cell and gene therapies with our RNA and mRNA products and expect to supplement with our upcoming plasmid DNA capability. In addition to the vaccine programs above, our products have been incorporated in over 40 therapeutic programs in development for CRISPR/Cas-9, CAR-T, base editing, vaccine and enzyme replacement therapies, among others with over 25 utilizing CleanCap® technology.
Our nucleic acid products fall into three categories: mRNA, oligonucleotides and plasmid DNA. We began offering our plasmid DNA products in the first quarter of 2021.
mRNA. mRNA is an intermediary molecule that translates the genetic information stored in DNA into proteins. The genetic information stored in DNA is transferred to mRNA in a cellular process called transcription. This process occurs in the nucleus of cells. DNA, a double stranded molecule, is unwound and copied as mRNA by the enzyme RNA polymerase. mRNA is then transferred out of the nucleus to the cytosol, a component of the cytoplasm of a cell, where it serves as a blueprint for making cellular proteins by a multi-component organelle complex called the ribosome.
mRNA has traditionally been a difficult molecule for vaccine and therapeutic purposes. mRNA is inherently unstable compared to DNA and is susceptible to degradation by ubiquitous enzymes called RNases. mRNAs are also physically and chemically fragile and can degrade at elevated temperatures and under shear forces that occur during downstream manufacturing processes. We have developed manufacturing processes that overcome some of these obstacles, resulting in highly effective mRNA.
We develop and manufacture mRNA products to support vaccine and therapeutic programs from pre-clinical development through and including clinical phases, including scale-up and analytical development services. The mRNA molecules may serve as APIs for diverse applications, such as enzyme replacement therapies, gene editing therapies and vaccines. We offer both research grade material and material made under GMP conditions for early phase clinical trials. 
Within the mRNA category, we also offer our CleanCap® products. Our proprietary CleanCap® analogs principally serve the mRNA vaccine and therapeutics markets, including vaccine candidates in development for immunizing against COVID-19. Cap analogs are a component of mRNA that aids in protein production as well as making mRNA more stable inside cells. For mRNA to serve as a template to make a protein, it requires a special cap at the 5’ (five prime) end of the molecule. The cap structure also affects the stability of the mRNA. The lack of a cap can result in activation of the innate immune system, which can affect the production of the desired protein or elicit undesired biological effects. We offer a suite of CleanCap® analogs that are specifically made for therapeutics and vaccines. Based on the Industry Analysis, we believe our cap analogs are critical features of several mRNA vaccines in development.

Traditionally, the 5’ cap has been added in one of two ways. The cap can be added post mRNA synthesis by an enzymatic process. This enzymatic method has several drawbacks, including the high cost of the capping enzymes as well as the need to perform additional processing steps to the mRNA to remove enzymes and byproducts of the capping reaction. While capping efficiency is usually high, the extra processing steps typically result in mRNA of poorer quality and degradation often results. The second method is to add a synthetic cap analog into the transcription reaction such that the mRNA is transcribed and capped in a single step. Anti-reverse cap analog (“ARCA”) is an example of a cap analog that is added to the transcription reaction. This avoids the workflow challenges of the enzymatic process, but typically results in lower yields.
Like ARCA, CleanCap® is a synthetic, chemically made mRNA 5’ cap analog added to the transcription process in a single step. Unlike ARCA, however, CleanCap® results in significantly higher levels of capping efficiency, resulting in very low levels of uncapped mRNA, which in turn minimizes the risk of activation of the innate immune system. In addition, CleanCap®’s higher mRNA yields compared to ARCA result in lower cost of goods. When compared to enzymatic capping, CleanCap® removes the additional downstream purification steps required. We have developed a suite of CleanCap® analogs that are specifically designed for therapeutics and vaccines. CleanCap® is sold as a stand-alone reagent or bundled with other mRNA products. More than 110 customers have purchased CleanCap® as a stand-alone reagent and more than 250 customers have purchased mRNA with CleanCap®. mRNA products represented 65% of our nucleic acid production revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 (including the revenue from CleanCap® products).
Oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide product category supports broad customer applications, including therapeutics, in vitro diagnostics, next generation sequencing (“NGS”) and CRISPR-based gene editing. Most of our TriLink BioTechnologies oligonucleotide products are custom manufactured DNA or RNA sequences, often highly modified and produced as research grade or under GMP conditions for use in development, clinical and commercial applications.
We also provide nucleoside triphosphates (“NTPs”). NTPs are the precursors to DNA and RNA. They are composed of a nitrogen base bound to either ribose or deoxyribose with three phosphate groups added to the sugar. We manufacture NTPs that are used in polymerase chain reactions (“PCR”), sequencing reactions and in the manufacture of mRNA. The NTPs can be unmodified, composed of the four standard bases, or modified, with a base altered to enhance a particular biological property, such as the ability to evade the innate immune system in therapeutic applications. TriLink BioTechnologies NTPs are used by customers in both research and clinical trial applications.
Our product offerings also include reagents that form the building blocks of oligonucleotides with our Glen Research products, including high quality specialty chemicals and amidites. The oligonucleotide products category represented 35% of our nucleic acid production revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Plasmid DNA. In December of 2020, we completed the manufacturing verification of plasmid DNA within our newly released manufacturing suite inside our San Diego facility. The manufacturing of beta customer plasmids began in the first quarter of 2021. Unlike genomic DNA, which constitutes the chromosome, plasmid DNA exists outside the chromosome and represents small circular double-stranded constructs. Plasmid DNA is frequently used as a vector for replicating nucleic acid products. Plasmid DNA is integral to the production of mRNA and our production of plasmid DNA will assist in ensuring the quality and timeliness of the mRNA we produce.
Biologics Safety Testing (19% of Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2020)
We provide products and services under the Cygnus Technologies, LLC (“Cygnus Technologies”) brand that ensure the purity of our customers’ biopharmaceutical products, including biological drugs. For over 20 years, the Cygnus Technologies brand has been associated with products and services that enable the detection of impurities present in bioproduction. Our biologics

safety testing products are used during development and scale-up, during the regulatory approval process and throughout commercialization. We are recognized globally for the detection of host cell proteins (“HCPs”) and process-related impurities during bioproduction.
Our customers in this segment manufacture a broad range of biopharmaceutical products. These include monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins, both as novel biologics and biosimilars, and recombinant vaccines including vaccines to prevent COVID-19 and to treat cancer. We also provide products in support of the development of cell and gene therapies. Recombinant vaccines and cell and gene therapies rely on manufacturing of various viral vectors produced using recombinant nucleic acid and cell culture technologies. Viral vector manufacturing processes require rigorous analytics, including testing for process-related impurities such as HCPs, host cell DNA, purification leachates, growth media additives and enzymes used in viral vector purification processes.
ELISA is the benchmark method for monitoring levels of process-related impurities during the purification process and in product release testing. The advantages of well-developed ELISA kits include the ability to measure very low levels of impurities in the presence of high amounts of drug product, without requiring a high level of expertise to run, and are readily transferable across an organization from process development to manufacturing and quality control bioanalytical groups. Though relatively simple to run, these ELISA kits require a high level of expertise to design, develop and qualify.
Customers establishing biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes may use off-the-shelf or generic HCP kits provided by manufacturers like ourselves, or they may choose to design their own in-house assays for their specific processes. Some customers may choose to use generic assays early in development and migrate to process-specific assays later. The trend in recent years has been for customers to increasingly use generic assays throughout their development pathway, relying on our expertise and the established performance of our assays. If customers choose to develop process specific assays, we offer custom antibody production and assay development as well as characterization services to meet their needs.
Our comprehensive catalog of Cygnus Technologies HCP ELISA kits covers 23 expression platforms and provides the specificity and sensitivity to detect impurities with reproducibility, which supports regulatory compliance. Our reputation for quality is recognized by the industry and global regulatory agencies, with Cygnus Technologies assays used as reference methods throughout the industry and to support manufacturing and quality control of commercialized biologics.
Our customers in this segment are biopharmaceutical companies, contract research organizations (“CROs”), contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”) and life science companies, which together accounted for 46% of our biologics safety testing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. International distributors and United States-based resellers accounted for 53% of this revenue. These customers largely serve the biopharmaceutical industry. Academia, hospitals and government accounts contributed 1% of our biologics safety testing revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Cygnus Technologies product categories include HCP ELISA kits, other bioprocess impurity and contaminant ELISA kits, ancillary reagents and custom services.

HCP ELISA kits. HCP ELISAs are kits used to detect residual proteins from the expression system used in bioproduction. HCPs constitute a major group of process-related impurities produced using cell culture technology no matter what cell expression platform is used. HCPs pose potential health risks for patients and the risk of failure of safety endpoints for drug manufacturers. When present in the administered product, even at low levels, HCPs can induce an undesired immune response, interfere with drug efficacy and impact drug stability. HCPs are a critical quality attribute for biologics safety testing development and must be adequately removed during the downstream purification process.
HCP ELISA kits represented 63% of our Biologics Safety Testing revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020.
Other impurity and contaminant kits. Products in this category include kits for measuring Protein A leachate, which results from the affinity purification method used for monoclonal antibody therapeutic agents; ELISA kits for measuring additives in growth media, such as bovine serum albumin; ELISA kits for measuring host cell DNA; and ELISA kits to detect and quantify residual endonuclease impurities in recombinant viral vector and vaccine preparations.
In addition, in 2020, Cygnus Technologies introduced the MockV™ Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) kit, a novel, proprietary viral clearance prediction tool that includes a non-infectious “mock virus particle” mimicking the physicochemical properties of live virus that may be present endogenously in the drug substance or introduced during bioproduction. The kit enables manufacturers to conduct viral clearance assessments easily and economically and to predict outcomes in-house ahead of costly and logistically challenging live viral clearance studies.
Other impurity and contaminant kits represented 19% of our biologics safety testing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 in the biologics safety testing segment.
Ancillary reagents. These products include antibodies, antigens, sample diluents and other auxiliary products necessary to optimize applications for customer processes. Ancillary reagents represented 11% of our biologics safety testing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Custom services. We provide process-specific antibody and ELISA development, qualification and maintenance services. In addition, we have pioneered advanced orthogonal methods including antibody affinity extraction (AAE™) and mass spectrometry for HCP antibodies coverage analysis and HCP identification, which we provide as custom services. Custom services represented 7% of our biologics safety testing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Protein Detection (8% of Revenue for the Year Ended December 31, 2020)
We believe that we are a leader in labeling and detection reagents for immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and glycobiology, principally in research settings, with Vector Laboratories, Inc. (“Vector Laboratories”), the brand under which we market our protein detection products, having been cited over 350,000 times in scientific publications. Our products are used to detect the expression of proteins in tissue, which may indicate an ongoing disease process, with the use of antibody-based detection systems. We also manufacture lectins, proteins that preferentially bind to carbohydrates and which are used, for example, in the study of glycosylation, the process by which carbohydrates attach to proteins and lipids. Glycosylation is critical in a range of biological processes, including cell-to-cell adhesion, the performance of glycoprotein-based drugs and cancer. In addition, we manufacture bioconjugation reagents to allow rapid and quantifiable conjugation of all classes of biomolecules.
Our presence in protein detection dates to the founding of Vector Laboratories in 1976. Under the Vector Laboratories brand, we provide reagents to researchers worldwide investigating biological processes and the nature of disease in tissue, including oncology research applications. Our reagents span the immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence workflows and include products for tissue preparation, tagging targets of interest via secondary antibodies, detection systems for visualizing proteins, enzyme substrates for chromogenic color development, secondary antibodies to amplify target signal, fluorescent dyes for use in live cell imaging, fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies and products for the identification and isolation of glycosylated targets.
Our expertise includes the development of a broad range of highly validated secondary antibodies, used for labeling targets of interest. We produce over 20 proprietary antibodies constituting over 180 different SKUs in different formats and quantities. We also offer a broad portfolio of over 5 distinct lectins making up nearly 140 Stock Keeping Units (“SKUs”) addressing a broad set of applications. Our capabilities extend to assay development, protein purification and bioconjugation as well as development of critical related reagents such as mounting media and substrates.

Our approach is to be a trusted partner throughout the life cycle of our customers’ products.
Innovation, Proprietary Technologies and Know-how Underpin Our Portfolio
Our expertise in complex chemistries leads customers to seek our collaboration in designing complex products that meet high performance expectations. Based on the responses to the Industry Analysis, we believe the solutions we provide, in many cases, cannot be provided effectively by our competitors. In certain cases, like our CleanCap® technology, our know-how is backed by intellectual property. In other cases, such as our HCP products, our antibodies are proprietary and therefore can only be supplied by us. We believe the proprietary nature of our know-how and products solidifies our long-term customer relationships.
Products with Outstanding Quality Performance
We believe our products stand out when compared to our competitors’ because they present innovative solutions to customer needs, as indicated by the responses to the Industry Analysis, while providing reliable performance and quality. CleanCap®, for example, offers advantages over competing capping technologies in yield, stability and safety. Our oligonucleotides address complex chemistry challenges, which we believe few competitors can address. The results of the Industry Analysis indicate that our HCP ELISAs have defined the market for impurity detection and we believe they have become a de facto standard in biologics safety testing. Similarly, our protein detection assays have been recognized for their performance for over 40 years.
Trusted Brands

manufacturing processes, quality standards, technical support and high-touch customer service ensure that we maintain the reputation of our brands.
State-of-the-Art Manufacturing Facilities
Our biopharmaceutical customers manufacture their products to meet stringent quality standards and expect their critical suppliers to meet their exacting requirements. Our customers further expect that we have the production capacity to meet their needs in a timely manner. As of December 31, 2020, we have invested approximately $75.0 million into our flagship San Diego facility and its five dedicated manufacturing suites to produce materials under GMP conditions, along with the required quality systems to meet requirements specified by our customers. Additionally, this investment in our San Diego facility allows us to meet our customers demand for our nucleic acid products, including CleanCap®. We similarly invest in our other sites to ensure we meet our customers’ expectations. We believe that the capacity to manufacture to stringent biopharmaceutical standards is constrained within the industry and our ability to meet this demand sets us apart from our competition.
Experienced Leaders and Talented Workforce
Our management includes experienced leaders with demonstrated records of success at Maravai and other highly regarded industry participants. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 20% of our workforce have earned advanced degrees and all receive rigorous on the job training. We believe the quality of our personnel is critical to ensuring the collaborative, long-standing relationships we maintain with many of our customers.
Our Markets
We participate in three distinct market segments: nucleic acid production, biologics safety testing and protein detection, which together represented approximately $8.4 billion in annual spending in 2019 and which are expected to grow at a 15% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) through 2023. Of that combined market, we estimate our addressable portion represents approximately $3.6 billion. Our addressable segments as a whole, adjusted for the mix of products we offer, are expected to grow at a weighted average blended rate of 20% per annum through 2023, according to industry consultants and management estimates. We benefit from favorable industry dynamics in our broader market segments and specific growth drivers in our addressable market segments.
Biopharmaceutical customers are increasingly relying on outside parties to provide important inputs and services for their clinical research and manufacturing, a development driving growth for suppliers with unique capabilities and the ability to manufacture at an appropriate scale to support customer programs. We believe that suppliers like ourselves, with this rare combination of capabilities, proprietary products and the required investment in manufacturing and quality systems, are benefiting from rapid growth as biopharmaceutical customers seek to partner with a small number of trusted suppliers.
In addition to the continued trend toward outsourcing, several market developments are driving increased growth, above the broader market growth rates, in our addressable market segments, including:
•Pivot toward mRNA vaccines driven in part by COVID-19. The first two vaccines to be approved for use in combating the COVID-19 pandemic were mRNA vaccines, including the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. mRNA vaccine pre-clinical programs grew approximately 38% in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. That rate is 
12


Table of Contents

estimated to have increased to approximately 63% in 2020. The increased growth is being driven, in part, by 34 COVID vaccine programs using mRNA as of March 9, 2021, according to the World Health Organization. Five of the 34, including two commercial programs led by Pfizer in partnership with BioNTech and the other led by BioNTech in partnership with Fosun Pharma, one phase I clinical program led by Chulalongkorn University, one phase I/II clinical programs led by Imperial College London and , one phase III program led by CureVac use our CleanCap® products and up to three more in early stages of development, led by the University of Tokyo in partnership with Daiichi-Sankyo, eTheRNA Immunotherapies and Greenlight Biosciences, are currently using our CleanCap® products. The mRNA vaccine technology is gaining prominence as a result of its faster development time, lower manufacturing costs and improved safety because of the lower risk of unwanted immune responses. RNA expertise is highly specialized and customers seek partners to provide these complex products. A small number of providers, like ourselves, can provide this RNA capability.
•Rapid growth in development of cell and gene therapies. Sales of cell and gene therapy drugs are expected to grow from $1 billion in 2019 to $25 billion by 2024 and recent approvals of Kymriah®, Yescarta® and Luxturna have added clinical credibility to cell and gene therapies. We support the development of cell and gene therapies with products used in gene editing and cell therapy research, and we are well positioned to supply materials for gene therapy with the launching of our DNA plasmid products in the first quarter of 2021.
•Large and growing pipeline of protein-based therapeutics. In addition to cell and gene therapies, an increase in protein-based therapies is driving the need for impurity testing during process development and manufacturing.
•Rise in molecular diagnostics driven by COVID-19. The market for molecular diagnostics is growing dramatically because of demand for new tests related to COVID-19. This growth is driving demand for our products, particularly oligonucleotides and related inputs.
•COVID-19 providing both short-term and expected long-term growth. Several of our product categories have experienced accelerated growth in 2020, notably our CleanCap® and oligonucleotide products. We expect the impact of COVID-19 on our growth to sustain in the longer-term as the entire mRNA category benefits from lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect research in other therapeutic categories to experience increased growth as research conducted for COVID-19 diffuses more broadly into other vaccines and therapies.

Nucleic Acid Production Market
The nucleic acid production market includes the production and synthesis of reagents for research and manufacturing of DNA and RNA-based biologics. Nucleic acid production is a $3.5 billion market expected to grow at 19% annually through 2023. Growth has generally accelerated in recent years with continued innovation in cell and gene therapy, including mRNA

Table of Contents

therapeutics and synthetic biology approaches. Our addressable portion of the market is $2.8 billion with expected growth of 28% annually through 2023. This higher growth rate is driven by our exposure to high growth sub-markets including RNA cap analog production and mRNA. Capping and mRNA growth is fueled by the continued growth of nucleic acid vaccines and therapies, which we expect will accelerate because of research into COVID-19. That research has highlighted the benefits of mRNA vaccines and therapies more broadly.
The field of mRNA-based drugs and vaccines has advanced dramatically within a few short years. Capacity to manufacture these products when approved, however, remains in short supply. Providers of technical expertise and manufacturing capabilities, like ourselves, with the facilities and quality systems demanded by biopharmaceutical customers, benefit from the demand created in the mRNA category.
COVID-19 is further accelerating growth in custom oligonucleotides and related inputs, which are used to manufacture diagnostic tests. New participants have entered the diagnostics market. Reference labs and hospitals have rapidly expanded their capacity. And demand for testing is increasing rapidly. These developments in turn lead to increased demand for our oligonucleotide products.
Biologics Safety Testing Market
The biologics safety testing market includes the detection and clearance of downstream bioprocessing product and process impurities. Biologics safety testing is a $2.8 billion market expected to grow at 12% annually through 2023. We participate in the HCP and other process related impurities and viral contamination segments of this market for biopharmaceutical vaccine and therapeutics manufacturing. These addressable segments account for $575.0 million of the market and are expected to grow at 13% annually through 2023. The growth in this market is driven by continued growth of biologics and biosimilars and increased outsourcing of process development.
Protein Detection Market
The protein detection market includes methods to detect and visualize proteins (antigens) in tissue sections to provide insight into gene expression, spatial relationships, and biomarker identification. Protein detection includes immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and glycobiology. Immunohistochemistry, our largest market within protein detection, is a $2.2 billion market, expected to grow at 8% annually through 2023. We participate in the immunohistochemistry segment of the academic and biopharmaceutical research market, which represents $200 million of annual expenditures expected to grow at 6% annually through 2023. This market saw a temporary contraction in 2020 of approximately 15% given lab closures due to COVID-19, but is expected to return to historical numbers.
Our Strategy
Our customers strive to improve human health. Our goal is to provide them with products and services to accelerate their development efforts, from basic research through clinical trials and ultimately to commercialization for drugs, diagnostics and vaccines.
Supporting Biopharmaceutical Customers from Product Development Through Commercialization
Our customers include both emerging and established biopharmaceutical leaders developing novel therapies, diagnostics and vaccines. Emerging biopharmaceutical customers frequently seek the support we can offer in our state-of-the-art facilities under our stringent quality standards, with the capabilities that result from the capital and process investments we have made over the last several years. We are capable of manufacturing reagents from research-grade to GMP-grade, which often exceeds the in-house capabilities of our pre-commercial customers. The results of the Industry Analysis indicate that our emerging and established customers also seek us out for our leading capabilities in nucleic acid chemistries and process control assays. We have expertise in complex chemistries, especially in highly modified nucleic acids and mRNA, and we believe we are a leader in applying these capabilities to the development of vaccines and therapeutics. We further support our customers as they transition from product development to commercialization by providing critical raw materials for their drugs. A core component of our strategy is the continued investment in facilities, quality standards and products and services that allow us to support our customers through the entire life cycle of their drugs.
Developing Proprietary Technologies that Deepen our Relationships with Our Customers
We believe we are experts in nucleic acids and our scientists aim to develop proprietary enabling technologies that become integral to our customers’ products. For example, CleanCap®, our proprietary chemical capping technology, has demonstrated its advantages in terms of the stability of the associated mRNA and its efficiency in protein production when compared to 
14


Table of Contents

traditional capping technologies. This efficiency has led biopharmaceutical customers to employ CleanCap® in their vaccine and therapeutic programs. As those products proceed through development into commercialization, we believe CleanCap® will be a critical input in on-market vaccines and therapeutics, with over 110 customers having used CleanCap® as of December 31, 2020 and five COVID-19 vaccine programs incorporating CleanCap® as of March 9, 2021, including two commercial program led by Pfizer in partnership with BioNTech and another led by BioNTech in partnership with Fosun Pharma, one Phase I clinical program led by Chulalongkorn University, one phase I/II clinical programs led by Imperial College London and, one Phase III program led by CureVac, and three pre-clinical programs led by the University of Tokyo in partnership with Daiichi-Sankyo, eTheRNA Immunotherapies and Greenlight Biosciences. We expect to supply our customers throughout their products’ life cycle.
Forming Long-Term Partnerships for Critical Biopharmaceutical Components and Process Tests
Our products are frequently incorporated into regulated and highly validated therapeutic and diagnostic products and processes. Our biopharmaceutical customers expect us to provide them with consistent, high quality products that meet narrow specifications, and that we ensure their supply chain for such products for the length of their programs. In many cases, we may be the sole source of the products we provide. We therefore take seriously our responsibility to our biopharmaceutical partners, and by extension the patients they serve. Our emphasis on partnership generally leads to long-term relationships with our customers.
Focusing Our Efforts on High Growth End Markets
While biopharmaceutical research and in vitro diagnostics markets are experiencing strong growth, we target the highest growth segments within those markets. Our product portfolio is well positioned to serve the biologic, cell and gene therapy and mRNA vaccine and therapeutic end markets, which are currently experiencing above-market growth. By investing in technologies at the forefront of biopharmaceutical and in vitro diagnostics, we aim to remain focused on the highest-growth applications.
Opportunistically Acquiring Leading Life Sciences Businesses and Supporting Their Continued Development
We built our business by acquiring established and emerging companies with strong scientific foundations in our target markets and investing in their systems, processes and people to accelerate their growth and expand their technologies. Going forward, we may opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe meet, or could meet after being acquired and expanded, the following criteria:
•address our core target markets;
•have a demonstrated adherence to high quality standards;
•be leaders in their market niches;
•have differentiated or proprietary products and processes that provide clear value to our biopharmaceutical and other customers; and
•have a track record of attractive rates of growth and compelling returns on invested capital.
Our acquisition strategy is to invest significantly in our acquired businesses. We strive to rapidly integrate their information and financial systems. All of our companies share a common enterprise resource planning system and we implement our financial controls and reporting systems soon after acquisition. We seek opportunities to invest in their facilities and personnel to provide an operating foundation for growth. We also augment their commercial capabilities through a combination of sales and marketing resources dedicated to each business, supported by our global marketing infrastructure.
We will continue to seek a balance between driving growth organically and through opportunistic acquisitions.
Commercial
We have relationships with the following categories of customers (percentages represent the share of revenue in each category for the year ended December 31, 2020): developers of therapeutics and vaccines (66%), other biopharmaceutical and life science research companies (27%), academic institutions (4%) and molecular diagnostic companies (3%). Our biopharmaceutical customers include startups, established biotechnology companies and large pharmaceutical companies developing enzyme replacement therapies, gene editing therapies, ex vivo therapies and vaccines.
Our commercial function includes direct sales, marketing, customer service, technical support and distributor management. We serve customers through direct sales in each business segment, with a primary focus on our larger biopharmaceutical and other 
15


Table of Contents

industry customers. We serve our academic customers via Web, email and phone ordering. We support all customers with live technical support and customer service.
We address customers outside the United States with a combination of direct sales and distributors. We serve many of our biopharmaceutical customers, especially in our nucleic acid production segment, via direct sales worldwide. Our distributors also sell our products in over 50 countries and provide customer service and local sales and marketing. As of December 31, 2020, our commercial organization included 58 employees and over 83 distributors.
Competition
We compete with a range of companies across our segments.
Nucleic Acid Production
Within nucleic acid production, we compete with four primary types of companies: (1) chemistry companies that create and produce the basic monomers, amidites, and supports that go into the creation of an oligonucleotide; (2) oligonucleotide manufacturers that specialize in custom oligonucleotide development of varying complexities and scales; (3) mRNA biotechnology companies that create fully processed mRNA and specialize in custom, complex orders; and (4) CDMO organizations that have the capability to accept work from large biopharmaceutical companies and serve as the outsourcing entity for the development and manufacturing of nucleic acid products. However, it is important to note that CDMOs seldom offer proprietary products.
For mRNA capping analogs, we compete principally with Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (“Thermo Fisher”) and Hongene Biotech Corporation, who offer alternatives to CleanCap®. Many biopharmaceutical companies produce capping solutions in-house using enzymatic or ARCA processes. However, given CleanCap®’s high yield and process efficiency, many customers who previously insourced these processes have begun to partner with us. Based on the Industry Analysis, we believe our products and services are more effective than those of our competitors. Deep scientific expertise, intellectual property protection and specialty equipment serve as barriers to entry in this space.
For our mRNA offerings, we compete with Aldevron LLC, Bio-synthesis Inc., and System Biosciences, LLC, among others. Based on the Industry Analysis, we believe we have a reputation for our expertise in the RNA space with talented scientists who are constantly pushing the frontier of RNA science. This scientific expertise and the required high-cost equipment serve as barriers to entry. In addition to our expertise, we believe our GMP cleanroom manufacturing process differentiates us from competitors.
For custom oligonucleotides, we compete with a number of manufacturers. Custom oligonucleotide providers include those that provide complex, highly modified oligonucleotides and those that provide less complex offerings. In the custom oligonucleotide space, complexity is based on the length of the sequence and level of modification to the phosphate backbone. Large manufacturers like Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Thermo Fisher and EMD Millipore Corporation (“Millipore Sigma”) serve less complex customer needs while Maravai, LGC Biosearch Technologies, Inc. and GenScript Biotech Corporation serve more complex customer needs. In the custom oligonucleotide market, we have a reputation for accepting complex orders and delivering high purity products that reduce researcher re-work and save money. Quick turnaround times and the ability to produce at scale are essential requirements in this segment.
In the oligonucleotide synthesis inputs market, we compete against large distributor-manufacturers like Thermo Fisher and Millipore Sigma while also serving them as customers. Our Glen Research brand has a long history in this industry, which drives customer loyalty, and has a reputation for high-fidelity technical service, focusing on supplying and sourcing highly modified inputs for its customers.
Biologics Safety Testing
For drugs in early development, we compete against other bioprocess impurity kit providers such as BioGenes GmbH (“BioGenes”) or Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (“Enzo”). Competitors generally offer fewer expression platforms (as few as one or two) compared to our offering of 23 expression platforms and a total of 78 ELISA impurity detection kits. As a drug successfully moves forward to validation and approval stages, a customer may either continue with an off-the-shelf kit or they may begin the process to develop a custom assay that is tailored to meet their specific host cell and manufacturing process needs. During the entire drug development process, and especially during this decision, we are partners with the manufacturer and provide our expertise to help them make the best bioprocess quality control and testing-related decisions.
If a drug manufacturer continues with an off-the-shelf assay from development to validation and approval, they will generally stay with the incumbent kit provider due to the extensive validation they have conducted. For custom assay development, our 
16


Table of Contents

main competitors are BioGenes, Rockland Immunochemicals, Inc., and some CDMOs and CROs with custom assay development capabilities. The trend in recent years has been for CDMOs, CROs and large biopharmaceutical companies to focus on core competencies and outsource host cell protein assays or qualify off-the-shelf kits when possible.
Protein Detection
In the protein detection market, we compete against large life sciences manufacturers and niche tissue staining offerings. We compete in the research segment of this market against large life sciences manufacturers such as Thermo Fisher and Abcam plc, who compete across the value chain offering primary and secondary antibody detection, visual detection and labeling, slide processes and visualization and analysis. Additionally, we compete against niche tissue staining offerings such as Enzo and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. We are differentiated by our deep visual detection and labeling experience, our Vector Laboratories brand’s sterling reputation established over more than 40 years, and the desire of our research customers to replicate past findings, many of which were completed using Vector Laboratories products.
Licenses and Collaborations
ProteinSimple Supply and Distribution Agreement
On August 12, 2019, we (through Cygnus Technologies) entered into a Supply and Distribution Agreement with ProteinSimple (the “ProteinSimple Agreement”) for the supply of bioprocess impurity assays to be assembled in assay cartridges for use in automated analyzer instruments.

We are obligated to pay a low four-figure annual license maintenance fee and royalties in the range of 5% to 10% on net sales of licensed products.
We must pay royalties to LSU until the expiration of the last to expire licensed patents. We are entitled to terminate the LSU Patent License Agreement for convenience at any time on at least sixty (60) days’ written notice, subject to paying in full all amounts due up to the date of termination and cessation of any exercise of the licensed rights thereafter. LSU may terminate the license for our uncured failure to make payments or our uncured material breach.
AmberGen Agreement
We (through Glen Research) entered into an Agreement with AmberGen, Inc. (“AmberGen”), dated May 11, 2000 (the “AmberGen Agreement”) under which AmberGen has appointed us the exclusive distributor of AmberGen’s proprietary photocleavable product offered under the name PC Phosphoramidite on a worldwide basis. We are limited to selling the product for research use only and are required to use good faith efforts to discontinue distribution to buyers making use of the product than purposes other than laboratory research.
We are entitled under the AmberGen Agreement to purchase product from AmberGen at AmberGen’s cost to manufacture the product. On a monthly basis, we are required to remit to AmberGen 50% of the gross profits on product sales for which payments were received in the preceding month.
The AmberGen Agreement was initially in effect for a five-year term but is now in a series of automatic one-year renewal terms. Either party may terminate the AmberGen Agreement on six months’ written notice or immediately for material breach of the other party or, subject to a cure period, for certain bankruptcy-related events.
BTI Biosearch Dyes Agreement
We (through Glen Research) are a party to a Commercial Supply and License Agreement with Biosearch Technologies, Inc. (“BTI”), dated June 29, 2004, as amended on November 8, 2004 (the “BTI Biosearch Dyes Agreement”), under which BTI agrees to supply us with certain BTI dyes and we are granted a worldwide, non-exclusive license to sell certain BTI dyes and to use BTI’s product-related trademarks to do so.

The rights granted do not include sales to customers for use in human in vitro or clinical diagnosis. We are required to pay a per unit price for the licensed BTI products.
The BTI Biosearch Dyes Agreement was originally in effect for a term of two years and is now in a series of annual year-to-year renewals. Either party has the right to opt-out of such renewals upon 90 days’ notice prior to the next renewal. Either party can terminate the agreement for convenience at any time on six months’ written notice. Either party can terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency.
Manufacturing and Supply
We occupy facilities in San Diego, California, Burlingame, California, Southport, North Carolina and Sterling, Virginia. Except for our Sterling facility, all our facilities are engaged in the manufacture of reagents.
Our San Diego facility, in particular, was designed and built by us in conjunction with the building owner to contain fully functional chemical and biological manufacturing operations from material receiving to product distribution and has its own loading dock, manufacturing gas delivery system, solvent delivery and waste system, ISO 8 and ISO 7 designated customer manufacturing suites and integrated building management systems for required site control. 
We continue to invest in our San Diego facility with recent expansions allowing for the manufacture of plasmid DNA and creation of ISO Class 8 and ISO Class 7 clean rooms providing for an expansion of the scale at which we can manufacture CleanCap® and NTPs, supported by a pilot plant for development of large scale manufacturing processes. This investment has 
18


Table of Contents

allowed us to substantially increase our capacity for nucleic acid production and specifically CleanCap® meeting the growing demand from our customers without interruption or constraints.
Our Southport and Burlingame operations are engaged in the manufacture and processing of antibody, ELISA kits and related reagents. The facilities incorporate laboratory, manufacturing, bottling, shipping and waste handling capabilities. Our Sterling facility was designed to perform quality control, aliquoting, packaging and shipping and houses the appropriate space and systems.
Our supply chain relies on a network of specialized suppliers and transportation companies. We regularly review our supply chain for supplier quality and risks related to concentration of supply and we take appropriate action to manage these potential risks.
Government Regulation
We provide products used for basic research or as raw materials used by biopharmaceutical customers for further processing, and active pharmaceutical ingredients used for preclinical and clinical studies. The quality of our products is critical to researchers looking to develop novel vaccines and therapies and for biopharmaceutical customers who use our products as raw materials or who are engaged in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Biopharmaceutical customers are subject to extensive regulations by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and similar regulatory authorities in other countries for conducting clinical trials and commercializing products for therapeutic, vaccine or diagnostic use. This regulatory scrutiny results in our customers imposing rigorous quality requirements on us as their supplier through supplier qualification processes and customer contracts.
Our nucleic acid and biologics safety testing segments produce materials used in research and biopharmaceutical production, clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products. We produce materials in support of our customers’ manufacturing businesses and to fulfill their validation requirements, as applicable. These customer activities are subject to regulation and consequently require these businesses to be inspected by the FDA and other national regulatory agencies under their respective cGMP regulations. These regulations result in our customers imposing quality requirements on us for the manufacture of our products, and maintain records of our manufacturing, testing and control activities. In addition, the specific activities of some of our businesses require us to hold specialized licenses for the manufacture, distribution and/or marketing of particular products.
All of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation, as appropriate under federal, state and local laws relating to:
•the surface and air transportation of chemicals, biological reagents and hazardous materials;
•the handling, use, storage and disposal of chemicals (including toxic substances), biological reagents and hazardous waste;
•the procurement, handling, use, storage and disposal of biological products for research purposes;
•the safety and health of employees and visitors to our facilities; and
•protection of the environment and general public.
Regulatory compliance programs at each of our businesses are managed by a dedicated group responsible for regulatory affairs and compliance, including the use of outside consultants. Our compliance programs are also managed by quality management systems, such as vendor supplier programs and training programs. Within each business, we have established Quality Management Systems (“QMS”) responsible for risk based internal audit programs to manage regulatory requirements and client quality expectations. Our QMS program ensures that management has proper oversight of regulatory compliance and quality assurance, inclusive of reviews of our system practices to ensure that appropriate quality controls are in place and that a robust audit strategy confirms requirements for compliance and quality assurance.
Research Products
Our products and operations may be subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, or local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, clearance, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-market monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical drugs. Certain of our products are currently marketed as research use only (“RUO”).
We believe that our products that are marketed as RUO products are exempt from compliance with GMP regulations under the FDCA. RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance on products labeled RUO, which, among other things, reaffirmed that a company may not make any clinical or diagnostic claims about an RUO product. The FDA will 
19


Table of Contents

also evaluate the totality of the circumstances to determine if the product is intended for diagnostic purposes. If the FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our products labeled and marketed for RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical products that will require clearance or approval prior to commercialization.
We do not make claims related to safety or effectiveness and they are not intended for diagnostic or clinical use. However, the quality of our products is critical to meeting customer needs, and we therefore voluntarily follow the quality standards outlined by the International Organization for Standardization for quality management systems (ISO 9001:2015) for the design, development, manufacture, and distribution of our products. Some biopharmaceutical customers desire extra requirements including quality parameters and product specifications, which are outlined in customer-specific quality agreements. These products are further processed and validated by customers for their applications. Customers qualify us as part of their quality system requirements, which can include a supplier questionnaire and on-site audits. Customers requalify us on a regular basis to ensure our quality system, processes and facilities continue to meet their needs and we are meeting requirements outlined in relevant customer agreements.
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“APIs”) for Clinical Trials
We provide APIs to customers for use in preclinical studies through and including clinical trials. We hold a drug manufacturing license with the California Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health for manufacture of APIs for clinical use and are subject to inspection to maintain licensure. Manufacture of APIs for use in clinical trials is regulated under § 501(a)(2)(B) of the FDCA, but is not subject to the current GMP regulations in 21 CFR § 211 by operation of 21 CFR § 210. We follow the principles detailed in the International Council for Harmonisation (“ICH”) Q7, Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (Section 19, APIs For Use in Clinical Trials) in order to comply with the applicable requirements of the FDCA, and the comparable GMP principles for Europe; European Community, Part II, Basic Requirements for Active Substances Used as Starting Materials (Section 19, APIs For Use in Clinical Trials). APIs are provided to customers under customer contracts that outline quality standards and product specifications. As products advance through the clinical phases, requirements become more stringent and we work with customers to define and agree on requirements and risks associated with their product.
Customers’ biopharmaceutical products early in their development have a high failure rate and often do not advance through the clinical stages to commercialization. Our customers are required to follow regulatory pathways that are not always known, which may cause additional unforeseen requirements placed on us as their contract manufacturer and delays in advancing to the next stage of product development. We also provide novel compounds for cell and gene therapy applications, which result in additional challenges for our customers attempting to obtain regulatory approval given that this field is relatively new and regulations are evolving. Customer clinical trials rely on approval from institutional review boards (“IRBs”) and patient and volunteer enrollment, which makes timelines unpredictable for advancing to the next stage in product development. Preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted by our customers are also expensive and data may be negative or inconclusive causing customers to abandon projects that were expected to continue. Regulatory requirements in both the United States and abroad are always evolving and compliance with future laws may require significant investment to ensure compliance.
Other Regulatory Requirements
Select agent and toxin. We have one product classified as a select agent and toxin. Pursuant to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) have established regulatory requirements for the possession, use, and transfer of biological agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, animal and plant health, and the safety of animal and plant products for their intended use. These requirements can be found at 42 CFR Part 73 (HHS), 7 CFR Part 33 1 (USDA-PPQ), and 9 CFR Part 121 (USDA-VS). The possession, use and transfer of the relevant biological agent and toxin in quantities greater than 1.0 gram is governed by the regulations of 42 CFR Part 73 (HHS), Possession, Use and Transfer of Select Agents and Toxins. Vector Laboratories is registered with the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) for these activities, is subject to inspection by the CDC and maintains an approved biosecurity plan. The regulations include specific requirements for safety (e.g. handling), security (e.g. access control, inventory control) and emergency response (e.g. addressing spills during manufacture or broken containers).
Environmental laws and regulations. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. There have been no material effects upon our earnings or competitive position resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment. Our capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2019 and 2020 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2021.

PCT patent applications are not eligible to become an issued patent until, among other things, we file one or more national stage patent applications within, depending on the country, 30 to 32 months of the PCT application’s priority date in the countries in which we seek patent protection. Moreover, we may own provisional patent applications in the future, and provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of one or more of related provisional patent applications. If we do not timely file any national stage patent applications or non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our PCT patent applications or provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in such patent applications. While we intend to timely file national stage patent applications relating to our PCT patent applications and non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage.
Individual issued patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.
Trademarks. Our trademark portfolio is designed to protect the brands of our current and future products and includes U.S. trademark registrations for our company name, Maravai, subsidiary names Cygnus® and TriLink® and various product names, such as CleanCap®.

Trade Secrets. We also rely on trade secrets, including know-how, unpatented technology and other proprietary information, to strengthen our competitive position. We have determined that certain technologies, such as the production of antibodies for biologics safety testing, are better kept as trade secrets, rather than pursuing patent protection. To prevent disclosure of trade secrets to others, it is our policy to enter into nondisclosure, invention assignment and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to trade secrets, such as our employees, collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our intellectual property or provide any competitive advantage. We cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future patent applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our products or technology. Our intellectual property rights may be invalidated, held unenforceable, circumvented, narrowed or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Furthermore, it may be difficult to protect our trade secrets. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, they may be inadequate and can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for violations of such measures. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Moreover, our invention assignment agreements with employees, collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties may not be self-executing or otherwise provide meaningful protection for our intellectual property rights. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, third parties, including our competitors, may be able to use our technologies to produce and market products that compete with us and erode our competitive advantage. For more information regarding risks related to intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.”
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had over 410 full-time employees. Among our employees, 41% identify as female and 59% identify as male. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and none of our employees has entered into a collective bargaining agreement with us. We offer a highly competitive compensation and benefits program to attract and retain top talent.
Our talented employees drive our mission and share core values that both stem from and define our culture, which plays an invaluable role in our execution at all levels in our organization. Our culture is based on these shared core values which we believe contribute to our success and the continued growth of the organization. Our core values are used in candidate screening and in employee evaluations to help reinforce their importance in our organization:
•Adaptability. We stay agile, ready to shift or change our approach when challenges arise and open to new ideas and responsibilities.
•Open Communication. We focus on open source sharing with our focus on constant improvement as individuals and as an organization.
•Quality Mindset. We strive to eliminate errors with accurate work as a priority and seek opportunities to improve products/services.
