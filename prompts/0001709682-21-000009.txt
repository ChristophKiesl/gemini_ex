Nesco Overview
Nesco is one of the largest specialty equipment rental providers to the growing electric utility transmission and distribution (“T&D”), telecom and rail industries in North America. Nesco offers its specialized equipment to a diverse customer base for the maintenance, repair, upgrade and installation of critical infrastructure assets including electric lines, telecommunications networks and rail systems. 
With a young, coast-to-coast rental fleet of more than 4,500 units as of December 31, 2020, Nesco has a diverse specialty fleet offering that includes insulated and non-insulated bucket trucks, digger derricks, line equipment, cranes, pressure diggers and underground equipment, with all-terrain options such as all-wheel drive, track mounting and rail mounting. Nesco’s rental fleet has an average unit age of approximately 4.0 years at December 31, 2020 compared to an average expected useful life of 15 to 25 years. The long useful life of Nesco’s equipment assets is a key driver of attractive asset economics. Nesco expects that a combination of highly attractive asset economics and long rental periods will continue to drive strong profit margins. In addition to renting its fleet, Nesco opportunistically sells both new and used specialty equipment, which fosters strong customer relationships, facilitates fleet management and strengthens supplier relationships.
Through its parts, tools and accessories, or PTA segment, Nesco provides its customers a total job-site solution, offering a range of parts, tools and accessories for rent or sale to fully equip their equipment and crews for activity in the field. Nesco’s large PTA inventory includes stringing blocks, augers, insulated hotline tools, hoist and rigging equipment and grounding clamps. Nesco’s comprehensive PTA offering expands opportunities to serve its equipment rental and sales customers through the convenience of a single vendor for all of their specialty equipment and PTA needs.
Nesco has an extensive geographic footprint which allows it to supply equipment and services to major electric utility T&D, telecom and rail customers throughout the U.S. and Canada. Nesco has over 60 locations, including third party facilities. This expansive footprint allows Nesco to opportunistically position its fleet in high-demand regions and across multiple end-markets, which drives high fleet utilization and results in superior customer connectivity. Nesco serves a diverse base of more than 2,000 customers as of December 31, 2020, including many of the top national and regional electric utilities, telecoms, railroads and related contractors.
Nesco’s three primary end-markets (electric utility T&D, telecom and rail) present large and compelling opportunities. Investment spend in these end-markets has exceeded the rate of GDP growth and shown resiliency through the economic cycle. Continued growth is supported by multiple important and transformative long-term trends. The electric utility market is in the early years of a secular upcycle, driven by utilities’ investment to replace or strengthen an aging electric grid, to integrate growing gas and renewable generation mandated by regulation and to meet the expanded demand from electric vehicles and electric heating with a growing focus on decarbonization. The 5G upgrade cycle is driving a new wave of telecom infrastructure spending. Urban congestion and increased freight transportation needs have driven a nationwide investment in improving rail infrastructure with many major projects approved and under development across the U.S. See “End-Market Overview” for additional detail.
Demand for Nesco’s equipment expanded from 2016 to 2019, as demonstrated by high levels of fleet utilization over this period. Prior to the Capitol Merger, Nesco’s ability to invest in its fleet to meet growing end-market demand was limited by the Company’s capital structure. As a result, Nesco turned away rental opportunities due to lack of fleet availability. With a strengthened capital structure following the consummation of the merger with Capitol Investment Corp. IV (“Capitol”), Nesco was able to make a significant investment into its fleet in 2019 to capture existing unmet demand as well as expected continued growth in demand from its end-markets. 
Pending Acquisition of Custom Truck
On December 3, 2020, Nesco Holdings, Inc., Nesco Holdings II, Inc., certain affiliates of The Blackstone Group (“Blackstone”) and other direct and indirect equity holders of Custom Truck One Source, L.P. (“Custom Truck”), Blackstone Capital Partners VI-NQ L.P., and PE One Source Holdings, LLC (“PE One Source”) entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which Nesco Holdings II, Inc. agreed to acquire 100% of the limited partnership interests of Custom Truck and 100% of the limited liability company interests of Custom Truck’s general partner (the “Acquisition”). Upon 
consummation of the Acquisition, the equity interest holders of Custom Truck will receive a base purchase price of $1,475.0 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments, indebtedness and transaction expenses of Custom Truck as of the closing date, as well as an adjustment on the basis of the target original equipment cost of the rental fleet inventory owned by Custom Truck as of the closing date, if any. As further described below, the purchase price for the Acquisition will be financed through borrowings under a new asset-based revolving credit facility (the “New ABL Facility”), proceeds from the Subscription and the Supplemental Equity Financing, the rollover of certain equity interests of Blackstone and certain members of the management of Custom Truck whereby the sellers will receive 20,000,000 shares of Nesco common stock at closing, cash on hand, and proceeds from the private placement of senior secured high-yield notes.
In connection with entering into the Purchase Agreement, Nesco entered into the Debt Commitment Letter pursuant to which certain lenders have agreed to provide a portion of the financing necessary to fund the consideration to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The financing is anticipated to consist of the following: (i) an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $750.0 million, $400.0 million of which shall be available on the closing date to finance the purchase price or, when determined, for working capital adjustments payable under the Purchase Agreement; and (ii) an issuance of senior secured notes (the “Notes,” the issuance of Notes, together with the incurrence of the new asset-based revolving credit facility, the “Debt Financing”) yielding approximately $1,000.0 million in gross cash proceeds and/or to the extent that the issuance of the Notes yields less than $1,000.0 million in gross cash proceeds or such cash proceeds are otherwise unavailable to consummate the Acquisition, loans under a senior secured bridge facility yielding up to approximately $1,000.0 million in gross cash proceeds (less the gross cash proceeds received from the Notes and available for use, if any).
The acquisition is expected to be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with Nesco as the accounting acquirer of Custom Truck. In identifying Nesco as the accounting acquirer, management considered the structure of the transaction and other actions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, including the composition of purchase consideration that will be issued to the selling equity holders of Custom Truck (consisting of cash from Nesco and Nesco common stock). Nesco also considered the relative outstanding share ownership and the composition of the combined company board following completion of the Acquisition. ASC 805 requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. 
Also on December 3, 2020, Nesco entered into the Common Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with PE One Source, an entity controlled by Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC (“Platinum”), in respect of the subscription relating to the issuance and sale to Platinum of (i) Nesco common stock, for an aggregate purchase price in the range of $700.0 million to $763.0 million, with the specific amount to be calculated in accordance with the Investment Agreement based upon the total equity funding required to fund the consideration to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) additional shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of not more than $100.0 million, if necessary, in connection with the “Supplemental Equity Financing.” The shares of common stock issued and sold to Platinum have a purchase price of $5.00 per share. Nesco has also entered into subscription agreements in respect of the sale of 28,000,000 shares of common stock in a private placement at a price per share of $5.00 for aggregate proceeds of $140.0 million (the “Supplemental Equity Financing”). 
Company History
Nesco was founded in 1988 as a family-owned equipment sales and rental company in Bluffton, Indiana, focused on the electric utility market. Following its acquisition by Energy Capital Partners (“ECP”) in early 2014, Nesco expanded and diversified its operations with the launch of the PTA business in late 2015 and the entry into the telecom and rail markets in 2016. The PTA business allowed Nesco to cross-sell a complementary product offering to its existing customer base. The expansion into the telecom and rail industries represented a natural extension given that a significant portion of Nesco’s equipment has applications across the electric utility T&D, rail and telecom end-markets. Nesco’s telecom and rail expansion was facilitated by Nesco’s acquisition of V&H Leasing Services, a rail equipment rental business, in 2016. The acquisitions of Bethea Tool and Equipment Company (“Bethea”) in 2017 and N&L Line Equipment (“N&L”) in 2018 further enhanced the PTA segment and positioned it for nationwide expansion. Bethea added manufacturing capacity of stringing blocks, the most significant product within the PTA portfolio. N&L added certified expertise in dielectric testing and manufacturing of certified live-line tools. In November 2019, Nesco closed the acquisition of Truck Utilities, Inc. (“Truck Utilities”), expanding Nesco’s presence in the Upper Midwest and bringing with it a young, underutilized fleet as well as upfit and service capabilities.
Merger with Capitol
On April 7, 2019, NESCO Holdings I, Inc. (which was the ultimate parent holding company prior to the transaction described below) (“Holdings I”) entered into a definitive agreement with Capitol, whereby the parties agreed to merge (the “Capitol Merger”), resulting in Nesco becoming a publicly listed company.
Capitol was originally incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands on May 1, 2017 as a blank check company under the name Capitol Investment Corp. IV to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more businesses or entities.
On July 31, 2019, we completed the Capitol Merger whereby Holdings I, became our wholly owned subsidiary and the entity (along with its subsidiaries) through which we operate our business. In connection with the Capitol Merger, Capitol domesticated as a Delaware corporation and changed its name to Nesco Holdings, Inc.
Segments
Nesco operates in two segments:
Equipment Rental and Sales. The Equipment Rental and Sales (“ERS”) segment principally provides specialty equipment rental solutions to customers including electric utilities, telecom operators, railroad operators and related contractors. These customers use Nesco’s equipment in performing maintenance, repair, upgrade and installation services on critical infrastructure assets. Nesco also sells new and used equipment through this segment.
Parts, Tools and Accessories. The PTA segment principally offers customers sale and rental solutions for parts, tools and accessories to complement Nesco’s specialty equipment fleet. Our PTA segment also includes maintenance, repair and upfit services of new and used heavy-duty trucks and cranes. Customers include equipment rental customers, industry contractors and select distributors.
End-Market Overview
Nesco’s core end-markets are electric utility T&D, telecom and rail.
General End-Market Trends
Nesco’s end-markets have demonstrated limited correlation with GDP growth and resiliency through the recent economic cycle, with 0.52 correlation to GDP from 2001 to 2019 compared to the construction end-market’s 0.70 correlation with GDP in the same period. For additional information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview of Markets and Related Industry Performance.” 
The North American market has experienced a secular shift from equipment ownership to rental. Rental penetration of the broader equipment fleet in North America increased from 42% in 2009 to 57% in 2019 and is expected to reach 65% by the mid-2020s. In comparison, other developed markets recorded higher rental penetration rates in 2017, including Europe at 65%, Japan at 80% and the U.K. at 80%, demonstrating the future potential of the North American market. Nesco believes that customers’ growing preference for equipment rental is driven by several factors including the avoidance of significant capital outlay, improved asset utilization, reduced storage and maintenance, access to a wider range of modern productive equipment, dedicated customer care and operational efficiencies.
Electric Utility T&D End-Market
Maintaining safe and effective transmission and distribution lines is critical to national infrastructure, as they carry the electricity that powers the nation. Transmission lines carry high voltage electricity long distances, while distribution lines carry electricity from local transformers to houses and businesses. Nesco’s specialty equipment is used in the maintenance and repair of live lines and installation of new lines. Capital expenditure spend in the electric utility transmission and distribution end-market is approximately $70 billion annually. This spend is driven by a number of attractive dynamics, demonstrating that the U.S. is likely in the very early stages of a multi-year electric utility T&D spending cycle.
Aging and Underinvested Electric Utility T&D Infrastructure. Electricity delivery in the U.S. depends on an aging and complex patchwork system of power generation facilities, transmission grids, local distribution lines and substations. Most electric utility T&D lines were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s with a 50-year life expectancy and were not originally engineered to meet today’s load demands. Today, approximately 40% to 50% of existing electric utility T&D infrastructure is at or beyond its

engineered life. Due in part to this aging infrastructure, costly electric emergency incidents and disturbances have increased more than sevenfold since 2000. Multiple costly fires have also been caused by aging and undermaintained transmission and distribution lines. The prevention of additional incidents associated with the continued operations of aging electric utility T&D infrastructure is expected to continue to drive increasing levels of maintenance and repair and replacement spend by utilities.
Changing Generation Landscape. The ongoing transition from coal to gas and renewables continues to drive changes in the generation landscape and transmission project development. Twenty-nine states and Washington, D.C. have adopted renewable portfolio standards, which mandate that a certain percentage — most states target 10% to 45% — of electricity sold by a utility must come from renewable sources. Approximately 786 gigawatts of new renewables and natural gas-fired generating capacity is expected to be added through 2050. As a result, significant spend for new transmission lines will be required to interconnect these new sources of power with the electrical grid.
Increased Focus on Decarbonization. With an increased societal focus on decarbonization, major fossil fuel driven sectors are shifting towards electrification. The electrification of vehicles, heating technology and industrial processes is expected to drive a significant increase in electricity demand and require a transmission investment of up to $90 billion by 2030.
Increased Outsourcing by Utilities. Utilities are increasingly turning to specialized third-party contractors to fulfill construction and maintenance needs. This outsourcing trend is driven by the challenge of an aging workforce and desire to shift the management and responsibilities of non-core activities to external service providers. Outsourcing is a favorable trend for Nesco, given its rental penetration among electric utility T&D contractors who prefer to rent due to lower initial capital outlay, increased flexibility, improved asset utilization and productivity and significantly reduced storage and maintenance costs.
Nesco’s longstanding relationships, national scale and diverse fleet of specialty rental equipment makes Nesco a key supplier to many companies in the electric utility T&D end-market. Approximately 75.8% and 76.4% of Nesco’s revenue was generated from the electric utility T&D end-market for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively.
Telecom End-Market
Telecommunications infrastructure, including telecom cells, towers and wirelines, are the backbone of telephonic interaction and the transportation of mobile data. Nesco provides the specialty equipment required to maintain and install telecom cells, towers and communication lines. Construction spend on telecommunications infrastructure is approximately $80 billion annually. This spend is expected to grow throughout the next decade due largely to the advent of 5G technology.
Rapid technological advancements, including advanced digital and video service offerings, continue to increase demand for greater wireline and wireless network capacity and reliability. Data traffic is at an all-time high and is expected to substantially increase in the future. United States data traffic is expected to grow at a 21% Compound Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) from 2017 to 2022. In response to this demand, Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc., T-Mobile US and Sprint Corporation (the “Big 4 U.S. Telecom Operators”) are planning to increase speed and capacity through the deployment of 5G technology.
5G technology will require the installation of numerous higher bandwidth small cells to “densify” wireless networks and enhance performance. This is because small cells only deliver coverage within approximately a quarter mile of their location, compared to approximately five miles for the existing 4G and predecessor macro cells. As a result, approximately 20 times more small cells will need to be installed in order to provide the same level of coverage as the existing macro cells.
The spend required by the Big 4 U.S. Telecom Operators to deploy 5G technology is expected to grow at a 40% CAGR from 2019 to 2023, continuing into 2030 with total 2019 to 2030 spend of approximately $240 billion.
Emerging wireless technologies are also driving significant wireline deployments. A complementary wireline investment cycle is underway to facilitate the deployment of fully converged wireless and wireline networks. Continued recurring maintenance will be required on existing wireline infrastructure and new 5G infrastructure.

Approximately 13.6% and 12.9% of Nesco’s revenue was generated from the telecom end-market in both the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively.
Rail End-Market
Freight and commuter rail are responsible for transporting products and people across the nation. Nesco’s rail mounted equipment is used for a variety of tasks including the installation of new rail and maintenance of the existing rail lines. The hi-rail equipment is utilized in projects for both installation and repair of track, electric lines, signal crossings and signs. The equipment is also often used for working on older infrastructure such as repairing bridges and terminals with more antiquated track and systems that are in need of upgrades with more modern systems like Positive Train Control (“PTC”) and others. The six largest public railroads spend more than $10 billion annually in capital expenditures, which is expected to continue to grow as freight demands increase. In addition to freight rail, spend on active commuter rail projects is significant with a growing pipeline.
Freight Rail.  Freight rail, one of the most cost-effective, energy-efficient modes of transport, carries about 40% of intercity freight as measured by ton-miles, more than any other mode of transportation. Total U.S. freight movements are expected to rise from around 18.0 billion tons in 2015 to around 25.3 billion tons in 2045 — a 41% increase. Nesco’s North American customers are principally Class I railroads and related contractors. Class I railroads operate in 44 states across the U.S. and account for 94% of freight rail revenues in North America.
Commuter Rail. Trends such as population growth, increasing urbanization, a focus on sustainability, environmental awareness and increasing highway congestion are expected to drive continued investment in commuter rail. Furthermore, as a result of years of insufficient funding, transit systems across the U.S. are struggling to cope with aging infrastructure, creating a massive and increasing backlog. The most recent federal estimate quantifies the backlog of projects required to attain a “state of good repair”, meaning public transit is repaired to an age within its average service life, at $90 billion — projected to grow to $122 billion by 2032. In August 2018, the U.S. Senate approved a fiscal-year 2019 appropriations bill that provides $16.1 billion for public transit and intercity passenger rail. Also in 2018, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s board adopted the Twenty-Eight by ’28 plan, which calls for completing 28 transportation projects at an estimated cost of $26 billion ahead of the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympics in Los Angeles.
Approximately 7.3% and 5.2% of Nesco’s revenue was generated from the rail end-market in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively.
Other End-Markets
Approximately 3.2% and 5.5% of Nesco’s revenue was generated from other end-markets in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, primarily from lighting and signage.

Competitive Strengths
Nesco believes that the following competitive strengths have been instrumental in its success and position Nesco for continued growth:
Market Leader Across Compelling End-Markets. We believe Nesco is a leader in each of the electric utility T&D, telecom and rail end-markets that Nesco serves with a fleet of more than 4,500 units of specialty equipment. Nesco has established this position by leveraging its expansive fleet, national sales and service network, longstanding customer relationships and operational expertise. All three end-markets are in the early years of a secular upcycle that is expected to persist for years to come. Nesco is well positioned to benefit from this projected growth.
Comprehensive Product Offering. Nesco has a broad product offering, including both a wide array of specialized rental equipment and a diverse range of ancillary parts, tools and accessories. Nesco believes that its diverse and comprehensive offering make it a specialty equipment provider of choice for its customers. Nesco believes its “one stop shop” value proposition sets Nesco apart from its competitors and strengthens customer relationships.
Expansive Geographic Footprint. Nesco’s geographic presence spans the United States and Canada with a network of more than 60 locations, including third party facilities. Nesco’s strategically allocated fleet and wide-reaching service capabilities allow it to quickly respond to both equipment and service requests from customers. The Company’s broad reach also represents a competitive advantage in serving customers with nationwide operations who may prefer the convenience of interacting with a limited number of equipment providers.
Established Customer Relationships and Industry Expertise. Nesco has longstanding relationships with its large and diverse group of customers. The Company has built strong expertise of the equipment and product requirements in its end-markets and works closely with its customers to determine their needs by projects. Nesco’s top ten customers have an average of an 19.6-year tenure with the Company. These established relationships represent a competitive advantage for Nesco.
Strong Financial Profile. Robust growing demand for Nesco’s equipment and strong asset-level returns enabled the Company to achieve a 13% revenue CAGR and an 11% Adjusted EBITDA CAGR from 2016 to 2020. Following the consummation of the Capitol Merger, our financial flexibility was improved to pursue strategic growth opportunities through investments in the fleet, expansion of the PTA business and selective strategic activity, while still maintaining prudent capital management. Nesco will also benefit from the use of certain attractive tax attributes, including a federal net operating loss carryforwards of $363.0 million and a state net operating losses carryforward of nearly $223.2 million, as of December 31, 2020.
Growth Strategies
Nesco intends to maintain its leading market position and drive continued revenue and earnings growth by pursuing the following strategies:
Invest in Fleet to Meet Growing Excess Demand. As a result of increasing demand from customers and a lack of equipment availability in Nesco’s fleet, the Company had to turn away more than 6,000 rental opportunities from 2017 to 2019. Nesco had limited ability to invest in its fleet during this period due to capital structure constraints. The number of rental opportunities that Nesco was unable to service due to a lack of product availability grew from 810 rental opportunities in 2015 to 1,999 rental opportunities in 2019 indicating a growing need for increased capital investment. Nesco tracks information on rental opportunities, including the reasons for opportunities not serviced, in its customer relationship management system.
With a strengthened capital structure, Nesco made a significant investment in its fleet in 2019, growing the fleet size by approximately 700 additional units. Nesco expects to address the existing and growing end-market demand with a targeted investment in product lines that have demonstrated the greatest excess demand, highest utilization and shortest payback periods. Nesco’s investments in its fleet will allow the Company to leverage its highly attractive unit economics, with unlevered internal rates of return of approximately 30%.
Increase Customer Penetration in Parts, Tools and Accessories. Since its launch in 2015, the parts, tools and accessories business has demonstrated significant growth, indicating the strong appeal of the product offering to Nesco’s customer base. PTA revenue as a percentage of equipment rental revenue increased from 17% in 2018, when only two locations were opened with a limited product offering at each of those locations, to 22% in 2020, excluding Truck Utilities, after Nesco opened four full service locations and a warehouse facility and added certified test and repair services to all of is full service locations. Nesco believes 
PTA revenue as a percentage of equipment rental revenue demonstrates the level of cross-sell of the PTA segment into its existing customer base and believes there is ample opportunity to increase this percentage over time.
Following the acquisitions of Bethea and N&L in 2017 and 2018, Nesco became well positioned to expand the PTA segment. N&L and Bethea added manufacturing capabilities of key PTA products, including stringing blocks and hotline tools, both of which are long-lived assets that represent the largest share of PTA rentals. N&L also added certified test and repair capabilities. Management believes the integration of these two operations provides Nesco a cost and expertise advantage compared to competitors.
Nesco increased the number of PTA full-service locations and warehouses from two in 2018 to eight by the end of 2020. Each full-service location provides certified test and repair services and an expanded product offering of both insulated and non-insulated tools.
Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. Nesco has successfully sourced, executed and integrated seven strategic acquisitions since 2012. These seven accretive acquisitions have bolstered Nesco’s market leadership, fleet diversity, end market reach, product offerings and geographic footprint. The companies were acquired for weighted average EBITDA multiples ranging from 4.0x to 5.5x, including realized synergies and 100% or more of the expected synergies were realized in each acquisition, demonstrating management’s ability to effectively source, execute and integrate acquisitions. Management is actively evaluating additional acquisition opportunities to allow Nesco to leverage its national platform and act as a preferred consolidator in a fragmented industry with many regional and local players.
On December 3, 2020, Nesco announced entering into agreements to acquire Custom Truck. Nesco expects the combination with Custom Truck will create a leading, one-stop-shop provider of specialty rental equipment serving highly attractive and growing infrastructure end-markets, including transmission and distribution, the 5G revolution build-out and critical rail and other national infrastructure initiatives. With complementary business lines, customer bases and capabilities, the combination is expected to yield significant benefits from increased scale, breadth of product and service offerings and expanded geographic coverage. Following closing, we expect that the combined company will have a more attractive financial profile with significantly reduced leverage and enhanced liquidity providing flexibility to address anticipated demand in the large and growing addressable market in which it operates.
Customers Nesco serves a large base of more than 2,000 customers, including many of the top national and regional electric utilities, telecoms, railroads and related contractors.
Rental Contracts In excess of 95% of new rental orders use Nesco’s standard rental agreement, pre-negotiated master lease or national account agreements. The initial duration of Nesco’s rentals is 28 days or one month. Thereafter, the contract is automatically renewed in increments of 28 days or one month until the customer returns the equipment. Customers are billed on a monthly basis. The average rental duration of Nesco’s rental portfolio was approximately 13 months as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. In addition to the monthly rental rates, customers are responsible for the costs of delivery and return to Nesco’s service locations, preventative maintenance and consumables, and any loss or damage beyond normal wear and tear. Nesco’s rentals require customers to maintain liability and property insurance covering the units during the rental term and to indemnify Nesco from losses caused by the negligence of the customer, their employees or contractors. Nesco also provides rental customers the opportunity to enter into Rental Purchase Option (“RPO”) contracts, when requested, which allow the customer to earn credit towards the purchase of the equipment based on the rental payments made.
Fleet Management Nesco employs a disciplined and strategic approach to fleet management and optimization. The fleet management process includes the development of an annual plan for procurement, submission of purchase orders with key suppliers, monitoring and tracking maintenance and repair requirements and end of rental life decisions regarding remount or sale for each unit in the fleet. Nesco utilizes a third-party web-based fleet management information system for enhanced visibility into the transportation and service phases of the rental cycle, enabling it to effectively manage service cost, uptime and utilization. The system provides Nesco’s sales and operations teams with remote access to real-time information, enabling fleet optimization and improving responsiveness. Nesco actively tracks utilization for each unit in its fleet and type to forecast availability and inform fleet investment decisions, while sales representatives and management closely follow developing projects and remain in constant communication with customers to forecast their equipment needs.
Nesco’s dedication to maintaining its fleet in like-new condition provides customers with more reliable, readily available equipment. Nesco’s expansive geographic footprint enables it to quickly turn around newly off-rent equipment which supports high utilization levels. Fleet maintenance that occurs in a service facility is executed either at a Nesco operated service location, or a third-party outsourced location. Fleet maintenance that occurs in the field is executed either by a Nesco employed technician or third-party field service technician. Major overhaul and repair jobs are typically performed by Nesco’s highly skilled internal 
service team. Third-party service providers typically perform routine maintenance work, including standard checks as equipment comes off rent, but are equipped to handle larger overhaul and repair jobs as needed. This unique service network improves Nesco’s maintenance response time, equipment reliability and utilization levels while allowing it to minimize fixed costs.
As units approach the targeted end of rental lives, based upon expected increasing maintenance cost curves and customers’ preference for newer equipment, Nesco’s technical fleet management team will evaluate each individual unit for potential retention, remount on a new chassis or sale. Dynamic review of aged fleet to determine remount applicability on key product lines occurs as a first screen for each unit. Nesco will look to sell equipment if a unit is not suitable for remount. Nesco realizes attractive used equipment sale values, driven by Nesco’s significant purchasing power with suppliers, industry leading maintenance programs and lead times associated with new equipment orders. Generally, fleet sales are executed with long standing rental customers looking to satisfy permanent fleet needs.
Suppliers Nesco sources the specialty equipment and parts, tools and accessories it rents and sells from a limited number of middle market suppliers including Terex, S.D.P. Manufacturing and Versalift. Nesco is one of the largest customers for most of its key suppliers, making Nesco an important and highly strategic sales channel for OEMs. Management believes Nesco receives preferential pricing terms and production priority unavailable to smaller competitors. Nesco’s senior leadership maintains strong relationships with key suppliers. The Company maintains a resilient supply chain network by sourcing equipment product lines from multiple manufacturers, keeping the market competitive and eliminating risk of disruptions from a single supplier.
Competition Nesco’s competitors include local, regional and national companies within the electric utility T&D, telecom or rail end-markets. The national competitors within the specialty equipment rental segment include Altec Industries, Custom Truck One Source and Danella Companies. In most cases, these competitors focus on a primary activity other than rental such as manufacturing, truck upfitting or construction services. The only national competitor within the comparable parts, tools and accessories segment is Wagner-Smith Equipment Co. Outside of Nesco, Nesco believes that no national provider has a comprehensive offering of both specialty equipment and adjacent parts, tools and accessories. In addition to national competitors, there are numerous local or regional competitors that serve Nesco’s target end-markets. These smaller competitors lack the scope of fleet, sales coverage, service coverage and PTA offering that is a part of Nesco’s customer value proposition. On December 3, 2020, Nesco announced entering into agreements to acquire Custom Truck.
Sales and Marketing
Sales 
Nesco operates with a nationwide direct sales team to address the specialized needs of its customer base and cultivate strategic partnerships with key customers in the industry. The more than 35-member sales organization is led by members of the senior management team including Presidents and Regional Vice Presidents.

Nesco’s field sales organization has developed “first-call” relationships with several of its largest customers while providing significant expertise in the technical nature of the equipment and projects.

Strategic Account Managers are responsible for establishing and managing these relationships along with direct involvement from senior leadership to create more contact and touch points between the key decision makers and Nesco.
Nesco divides the remainder of its sales organization into regional go-to market teams for the equipment rental and PTA segments consisting of Territory Managers supported by Inside Rental Representatives and Assistants. Territory Managers are responsible for developing new relationships and maintaining communication with key decision makers at customer organizations and working with employees at both the corporate office and on individual job sites to ensure customer satisfaction. After a rental opportunity is generated, Inside Rental Representatives and Assistants serve in a support role by working directly with customers to finalize orders, schedule delivery, coordinate payment and handle inbound requests. This direct communication helps expedite future orders with an industry leading turnaround time of 30 minutes on rental equipment availability and rate quotes.

Nesco utilizes targeted advertising, tradeshows, focused email distributions, a comprehensive equipment catalog and a company website for marketing its products and services. The rental catalog contains detailed technical information and diagrams for all Nesco products, while the website offers easy access to equipment specifications and rental listings.

materials with ten to twelve major marketing publications annually. In addition to print and online publications, Nesco participates in national and select regional trade shows, which represent important customer touch points for the sales team to both approach new customers and maintain strong relationships with existing customers.

Recruitment, training, and retention of employees is essential to the Nesco’s continued growth and fulfillment of customer needs. Nesco pays competitive wages and benefits, and other incentives intended to encourage safety, retention, and long-term 
employment. Employees are encouraged to participate in the Nesco’s 401(k) program, and Company-sponsored health, life, and dental plans. Nesco believes these factors aid in attracting, recruiting, and retaining employees in a competitive market.
