ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction



We are a blank check company incorporated on July 21, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this report as our initial business combination. 



The Registration Statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on November 17, 2021 (the “Initial Public Offering,” or “IPO”). On November 22, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 6,000,000 units (the “Units”) at $10.00 per Unit Each Unit consists of one share of common stock, $0.0001 par value (the “Common Stock”), one right to receive one-twentieth (1/20) of a share of Common Stock upon the consummation of an initial business combination and one redeemable warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase three-fourths (3/4) of a share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per whole share. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $60,000,000. The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 900,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. The Company incurred offering costs of $5,587,733, of which $2,587,500 was for deferred underwriting commissions. On November 22, 2021, the over-allotment option was exercised in full.



On November 22, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company completed the private sale (the “Private Placement”) of 193,889 units and 60,000 units, respectively (the “Private Units”) to Arisz Investments LLC, the Company’s sponsor (the “Sponsor”) and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, generating total proceeds of $2,538,886.



 The closing of the issuance and sale of the additional Units (the “Over-Allotment Option Units”) occurred on November 24, 2021. The total aggregate issuance by the Company of 900,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit resulted in total gross proceeds of $9,000,000. On November 24, 2021, simultaneously with the sale of the Over-Allotment Option Units, the Company consummated the private sale of an additional 13,500 Private Units and 9,000 Private Units to the sponsor and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, respectively, generating gross proceeds of $225,000. The Private Units were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.



A total of $69,000,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the Over-Allotment Option Units) and the Private Placements on November 22, 2021 and November 24, 2021, were placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), located in the United States and held as cash items or may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by us, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to our stockholders.



If we are unable to complete an initial business combination by February 22, 2024 subject to additional extension elected by the Sponsor (unless such date is further extended by a shareholder vote in accordance with our governing documents), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining holders of common stock and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Holders of rights or warrants will receive no proceeds in connection with the liquidation with respect to such rights or warrants, which will expire worthless. In connection with our redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares, each holder will receive an amount equal to (1) the number of public shares being converted by such public holder divided by the total number of public shares multiplied by (2) the amount then in the trust account (initially $10.00 per share), which includes the deferred underwriting commission, plus a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us or necessary to pay our taxes (subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors).

Merger Agreement



On January 21, 2022, Arisz entered into that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), by and between Arisz and Finfront Holding Company, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“BitFuFu”), pursuant to which (a) Arisz will form BitFuFu Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company, as its wholly owned subsidiary (“Purchaser”), (b) Purchaser will form Boundary Holding Company, a Cayman Islands exempted company, as its wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), (c) Arisz will be merged with and into Purchaser (the “Redomestication Merger”), with Purchaser surviving the Redomestication Merger, and (d) Merger Sub will be merged with and into BitFuFu (the “Acquisition Merger”), with BitFuFu surviving the Acquisition Merger as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Purchaser (collectively, the “Business Combination”). Following the Business Combination, Purchaser will be a publicly traded company listed on a stock exchange in the United States. On April 4, 2022, each of Arisz and BitFuFu entered into that certain Amendment to the Merger Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, the parties clarified certain Cayman Island corporate law matters by mutual agreement.



Finfront Holding Company operates under the trade name of “BitFuFu”, is a fast-growing digital asset mining service and world-leading cloud-mining service provider, dedicated to fostering a secure, compliant, and transparent blockchain infrastructure. BitFuFu provides a variety of stable and intelligent digital asset mining solutions, including one-stop cloud-mining services and miner hosting services to institutional customers and individual digital asset enthusiasts.



In consideration of the Acquisition Merger, Purchaser will issue 150,000,000 ordinary shares (the “Closing Payment Shares”) with a deemed price per share US$10.00 (“Aggregate Stock Consideration”) to the shareholders of BitFuFu. The Aggregate Stock Consideration consists of 7,500,000 Class A ordinary shares and 142,500,000 Class B ordinary shares of Purchaser.



The Merger Agreement originally provided that the closing of the Business Combination shall occur no later than July 31, 2022 (the “Outside Date”) and that the Outside Date may be extended upon the written agreement of Arisz and BitFuFu.



On July 14, 2022, each of Arisz, BitFuFu, the Purchaser and Arisz’s Sponsor (along with any assignee of Arisz’s Sponsor, the “Buyer”) entered into a backstop agreement (the “Backstop Agreement”) whereby, in connection with the Business Combination, the Buyer has agreed to subscribe for and purchase no less than US$1.25 million worth of shares of Arisz’s common stock par value $0.0001 per share, or Purchaser’s Class A ordinary shares.



On October 10, 2022, Arisz and BitFuFu entered into an amendment to the Merger Agreement to provide, among other things: 1) for a loan from BitFuFu to Arisz in the amount of $2,220,000 (the “Loan”) for the purpose of funding Arisz’s extension of the time to consummate a business combination and for working capital purposes, and 2) remove all existing restrictions on 400,000 shares issued to our initial stockholders that are currently subject to transfer restrictions, so that such shares are freely tradeable upon the Closing. The Loan was to be funded in three equal installments of $740,000 on each of October 26, 2022, January 26, 2023 and April 26, 2023.



On October 10, 2022, Arisz issued an unsecured promissory note to BitFuFu (the “BitFuFu Note”) for the amount of the Loan at an interest rate of 3.5% per annum and is due on October 26, 2023. Arisz may elect to issue a number of unregistered shares of its common stock, valued for these purposes at $10.00 per share, the aggregate value of which shall be equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Loan to the BitFuFu or its designee on or prior to the October 26, 2023 in lieu of paying all outstanding principal under this Note.



On October 13, 2022, the parties to the Backstop Agreement entered into a new backstop agreement substantially on the same terms as the Backstop Agreement with the only substantive additional terms being that: 1) the subscription amount is $2.0 million worth of shares and 2) the termination date is the earlier of: (i) the date agreed by the parties thereto in writing and (ii) the date that the Merger Agreement is terminated, on its terms.



On October 24, 2022, Arisz received $740,000, the first installment of the Loan, from BitFuFu.



On November 9, 2022, Arisz deposited $690,000 into the Trust Account (representing $0.10 per each share of redeemable common stock) to extend the time for Arisz to complete the Business Combination by three months until February 22, 2023.

On January 20, 2023, Arisz received $740,000, the second installment of the Loan, from BitFuFu.



On February 7, 2023, the Company notified the trustee of its intent to extend the time available to the Company to consummate a business combination from February 22, 2023 to May 22, 2023 (the “February 2023 Extension”). The February 2023 Extension was the second and last of up to two three-month extensions permitted under Arisz’s governing documents. On February 9, 2023, Arisz deposited $690,000 into the Trust Account (representing $0.10 per each share of redeemable common stock) to extend the time for Arisz to complete the Business Combination by three months until May 22, 2023.



On April 24, 2023, Arisz and BitFuFu entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Merger Agreement to provide, among other things: 1) to reduce the amount of the Loan from $2,220,000 to $1,930,000 for the purpose of funding Arisz’s extension of the time to consummate a business combination and for working capital purposes and 2) that the third installment of the loan will be in the amount of $450,000. On April 25, 2023, Arisz received $450,000, the third installment of the Loan, from BitFuFu.



On May 11, 2023, Arisz held a special meeting of stockholders to consider, among other things, proposals to amend Arisz’s charter in order to extend the time it has to complete its initial business combination up to nine (9) times with each extension allowing for an additional one (1) month period from May 22, 2023 to February 22, 2024, provided that Arisz contributes to the Trust Account $120,000 for each one-month extension, paid on a month-to-month and as-needed basis. At the special meeting, the requisite number of stockholders voted in favor of these proposals.



In connection with the special meeting, 3,745,635 shares of Common Stock were tendered for redemption. As a result, approximately $39.18 million (approximately $10.46 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders, without taking into account additional allocation of payments to cover any tax obligation of Arisz, such as franchise taxes, but not including any excise tax, since that date.



In connection with the special meeting, in each of May, June, July, August, September, October and November 2023, Arisz timely deposited $120,000 into Arisz’s Trust Account, thereby extending the date by which an initial business combination may be consummated. As of the date hereof, Arisz has until January 22, 2024 to consummate its initial business combination, unless the Sponsor elects to further extend, to as late as February 22, 2024.



On July 28, 2023, Arisz and BitFuFu entered into Amendment No. 4 to the Merger Agreement (“Amendment No. 4”) to provide, among other things: (1) that the Outside Date for the completion of the Corporation’s business combination, as defined therein be extended from August 1, 2023 to November 17, 2024 and (2) for an amendment to the loan installment of $360,000 to be extended on each of August 2, 2023, November 2, 2023, February 2, 2024, May 2, 2024 and August 2, 2024 to be used to cover the extension costs, and the remaining balance of each loan installment to be used for working capital. In accordance therewith, on July 28, 2023, Arisz and BitFuFu amended and restated the BitFuFu Note.



We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete the Business Combination will be successful.

Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees



We currently have two officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary, in the exercise of their respective business judgement, to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. We do not have an employment agreement with any member of our management team.



For additional discussion of the general development of our business, see our final prospectus on Form 424B4 filed with the SEC on November 19, 2021 along with our other filings made with the SEC.
