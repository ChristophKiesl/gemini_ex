ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are a less-lethal defense technology company, specializing in innovative next generation solutions for security situations that do not require the use of lethal force. Our mantra is “Live Safe,” and our core mission is to empower people to actively embrace life. We fulfill our mission by developing easy to use self-defense tools that allow people to live safely and by developing non-lethal alternatives to firearms and lethal munitions for law enforcement that can put a stop to unnecessary loss of human lives and facilitate trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. We have two main product lines: (i) our Byrna® line of handheld personal security devices for use by civilians and private security without the need for a background check or firearms license and (ii) our legacy less-lethal SDI® branded munitions line for 40MM rifled launchers utilized by law enforcement, correctional services and military markets.
 
Our primary focus is our Byrna line of products, launched in 2019, which we sell directly to U.S. consumers through our Byrna® e-commerce site, as well as to dealers and distributors primarily in the United States and South Africa. The core product in the Byrna line is the Byrna HD, a compact, ergonomically designed, handheld personal security device with the size and form factor of a compact handgun. It is easy to use, has virtually no recoil, and is designed to fire accurately with an effective range of 60 feet. The Byrna HD utilizes several of our proprietary patents and more than 60 custom designed parts. It comes with multiple easily reloadable magazines that can hold five .68 caliber rounds, including highly effective chemical irritant projectiles designed to burn an assailant’s eyes and affect the respiratory system upon contact, impact projectiles that can be used for self-defense or training, and inert rounds for training. The Byrna HD is fitted with a picatinny rail that allows owners to mount accessories, including laser sights and or flashlights, so that even novices can fire with a high degree of accuracy. It is designed to provide a less-lethal and highly effective alternative to a firearm, effective at a much safer stand-off distance than pepper spray or stun guns. A kinetic version of our base Byrna HD kit, which does not come with chemical irritant projectiles, is available for self-defense in states and municipalities that prohibit chemical irritant projectiles.
 
The flagship product in our less lethal munitions line is the SDI® branded BIP®, a blunt impact kinetic energy round designed for 40mm rifled launchers used in the law enforcement, correctional services and military markets. The BIP’s patented technology involves an internal energy absorption system, as well as a collapsible nose which “mushrooms” upon impact. The technology spreads the effect of the BIP’s impact over a larger surface area than competing products, affecting more sensory nerves and increasing perceived pain. At the same time, it absorbs a portion of the kinetic energy reducing the risk of serious injury. The BIP is also highly accurate through its design’s utilization of ballistic technologies that allow for consistent in-flight stability throughout an almost flat trajectory. Our BIP rounds have repeatedly shown effectiveness and reliability at ranges up to 164 feet (50 meters).
 
Strategic Focus and Products
 
We believe that the Byrna HD fills a perceived need in both the civilian and professional markets. It provides ordinary civilians - homeowners and renters, RV owners and campers, truckers, real estate agents, parents and grandparents, and anyone whose day-to-day travels expose them to the threat of a would be assailant with an effective less-lethal tool to reduce their exposure to risk and help ensure the safety of their person, property and loved ones. It also provides corrections officers, peace officers, and private security professionals, including those not licensed to carry a firearm, with an effective, less-lethal option in their arsenals. Moreover, though not initially designed for or marketed to law enforcement, the Byrna HD has attracted interest from both domestic and international law enforcement. As a result, the Company recently began selling the Byrna HD to law enforcement officers and has developed a training program for law enforcement on use of the Byrna HD. We are in the process of designing Byrna launchers specifically designed to meet law enforcement needs, as well as a number of other planned enhancements and next gen products.
 
We believe that the market response to the Byrna HD supports management’s belief in the product and the less-lethal market. Beginning in June 2020, demand has exceeded supply. A challenge going forward is sourcing ammunition and accessories, as our suppliers of those products have not been able to meet our customers’ increased demands. See “Marketing and Sales” and “Backlog,” below for additional information.
 
We believe the BIP® is among the best 40mm kinetic energy impact rounds currently on the market. However, in 2017 we concluded that the customer acquisition cost associated with selling the 40mm projectiles was uneconomical due to the extremely fragmented nature of the law enforcement market in the United States, the expense of performing required live fire demonstrations, and perceived resistance to changing suppliers or products. As a result, we have not devoted significant resources to the sale and marketing of the 40MM projectiles over the last several years, focusing our resources instead on the development and launch of the Byrna line. During this period, we continued to manufacture and sell BIP rounds to existing and new customers who contact us through our website.
 
Marketing and Sales 
 
Through late 2019, our efforts to create brand awareness and market our Byrna line of products to customers were limited as we worked to improve the product and the production process. In early fiscal 2020, we began to test various promotional specials, ran banner ads, and sought to direct traffic to our e-commerce store through the use of social influencers, blogs, and other digital marketing tools. At the end of February 2020, we hired a director of sales and marketing who expanded our use of digital marketing tools, implemented a nationwide reseller and distribution network of brick and mortar outlets, and engaged third-party marketing firms to market our products to industry leading companies in the firearms, outdoor and sporting goods channels. We also hired an executive vice president of international sales and marketing responsible for the development of global sales and the creation of a global distribution network for the Byrna HD. Plans to market our Byrna line of products at trade shows, conventions, state fairs and other live events were put on hold due to the pandemic, but our e-commerce store traffic and sales have grown during this period in keeping with the trend towards online shopping.

In June 2020 the Byrna HD was featured on a national news program. This increased our brand recognition, which we believe led to a substantial increase in orders and of web traffic to our e-commerce store. This increased demand, coupled with pandemic related disruptions to Byrna’s supply chain and a severe reduction in commercial air traffic which hampered our ability to ship finished product from our manufacturing facility in South Africa to our U.S. distribution center resulted in a significant backlog of orders during the third quarter, which persisted through the end of the fiscal year. See “Backlog,” below. In order to catch up with the backlog and focus on production and customer satisfaction, we paused all marketing efforts through the end of the fiscal year (and into the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2021). We hired a Chief Supply Chain Officer and dramatically expanded our roster of vendors. In September of 2020 the Company opened a second manufacturing facility in Ft. Wayne Indiana. As a result of these efforts, the Company was able to increase production from 100 units a day to more than 850 units a day. The Company continues to explore other ways to address the ongoing interruptions to the supply chain, particularly for third party manufactured accessories and ammunitions. We are focused on controlling and mitigating the effects of disruptions to our operations caused by the worldwide pandemic, while prioritizing the health and safety of our workforce.
 
Subsequent to the fiscal year ended November 30, 2020, we have divided the sales and marketing roles and hired a new Chief Marketing Officer with extensive experience in digital advertising and product promotion to analyze our historic sales and marketing data and develop a comprehensive state of the art marketing program. During 2020, the Company hired R.J. Boatman as Chief Governmental Affairs Officer. Mr. Boatman, who was co-developer and former Operations Director of the nation’s first Center for Safe and Secure Schools at the Harris County Department of Education and the former Executive Director of the Texas Safe Schools Alliance, is developing a program to address school safety using the Byrna Personal Security Device. While management is excited about the potential growth in sales that may be achieved through these new marketing initiatives, we cannot make any projections of the likelihood of its success, particularly given the ongoing risks posed by the pandemic to our production and distribution operations.
 
Manufacturing, Suppliers and Distribution
 
The component parts of the Byrna HD and magazines are sourced from Southeast Asia, the United States, South Africa, China, Europe, and Mexico, and our CO2 cartridges are imported from Japan. Through the first half of the fiscal year ended November 30, 2020, the Byrna HD and magazines were assembled by our South African subsidiary, Roboro, which was acquired by Byrna South Africa effective May 5, 2020 and subsequently merged into Byrna South Africa. Beginning in June 2020, as a result of the increased demand for our products as well as pandemic related increases in the difficulty and expense associated with shipping finished goods from South Africa, we expanded our manufacturing operations in South Africa, and accelerated plans to expand our U.S. distribution center and open a second manufacturing facility in the U.S. The expanded distribution center went online in late July 2020, and we began manufacturing Byrna HD launchers in the U.S in early October.
 
Our Byrna HD chemical irritant and inert projectiles and tactical holsters are manufactured in South Africa. Our kinetic projectiles and other accessories are manufactured in the U.S. The suppliers of our non-proprietary accessories including Crimson Trace products and concealed holsters are domestic, although they may import component products and materials.
 
Development, supply and manufacturing of our 40mm less-lethal projectiles have been conducted with one manufacturer in the United States since 2012. The current manufacturing agreement terminates in August 2021 with an automatic extension for additional one-year terms if neither party has given written notice of termination at least 60 days prior to the end of the then-current term.
 
Backlog 
 
As of the end of the fiscal year ended November 30, 2020 our expanded supply chain and increased production capacity enabled us to reduce our previous backlog, shipping approximately $11.0 million in orders in the fourth quarter. At the fiscal year-end, we continued to have a backlog of approximately $7.0 million worth of orders, primarily due to new orders and ongoing pandemic related delays in the supply chain, particularly for third party manufactured ammunition and accessories. We continue to take steps to address these shortages. We have reduced delays in fulfillment of Byrna HD launcher orders from over 10 weeks as of November 30, 2020 to 5 weeks at the date of filing this Report. However, industry wide shortages of certain materials, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our manufacturers of our third-party produced ammunition and accessories continue to result in back-orders for Byrna ammunition and accessories. Future shortages, implementation of pandemic or new testing protocols, supply chain interruptions, or illness outbreaks at our facilities or among our key executives could interfere with production or distribution of launchers or other operations. See Item 1A of this Report, “Risk Factors” below.

Research and Development
 
We conduct research and development activities to enhance existing products and develop new products in our newly established R&D Center in Andover Massachusetts (co-located with Byrna’s corporate headquarters). We are actively researching and developing possible improvements to existing products and potential new products, including an extended version (the Byrna XL), a dedicated Law Enforcement version (the Byrna LE), a smaller and more compact version (the Byrna CP) and, a professional edition which will fire shaped projectiles (the Byrna PE) as well as long guns for law enforcement and correction services. The Company is also working on new less-lethal munitions for the Byrna product line including fully biodegradable rounds.
Intellectual Property
 
The Company holds fifty granted or pending patent applications worldwide. Of these patent applications:
 

● | two are pending international patent applications in terms of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (the “PCT”) have been filed in respect of the Byrna HD personal security device, and rights to file patent applications in all 153 contracting states of the PCT are reserved; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | thirty pertain to the shaped aerodynamic less-lethal gas propelled projectile, with patents granted in the U.S., Australia, China, Hong-Kong, Israel and 23 member states of the European patent convention, with only the Canadian patent application still pending; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a further five patent applications (four pending, one granted) have been filed in the U.S. and South Africa in respect of darts connectable to the shaped aerodynamic projectile for use in animal husbandry, and to a shotgun wad for enabling the shaped projectile to be encapsulated in a 12-gauge shotgun cartridge and fired from a 12-gauge shotgun; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | four patents have been granted in the United States, two in Israel and one each in Canada and India for the Company’s so called Blunt Impact Projectile (“BIP”). The Company has abandoned its wireless electronic patents as not economically viable and also has determined not to pursue the BIP patents in India which will be allowed to lapse in order to focus on the more successful and commercially viable Byrna line. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to the patent applications listed, the Company owns a further twenty-one granted/pending design patent applications worldwide. The design patent applications pertain to the specific design embodiments of the shaped aerodynamic projectiles, and various adaptations thereof, and to internal components and features of the Byrna HD personal security device. Design rights in the projectiles have been pursued in the USA, Europe, Australia, Israel, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and South Africa.
 
Competition
 
In the home and personal security markets our Byrna line competes with established manufacturers of stun guns, including Taser products, and manufacturers of other handheld CO2 powered launchers of chemical irritant projectiles, such as United Tactical Systems, which sells Pepperball brand launchers to law enforcement and consumers, and Kore Outdoors, the parent of Mission Less Lethal, which sells a modified paintball gun for use with chemical irritant rounds to consumers directly and through the resellers Salt Supply and Sabre as well as to domestic and international law enforcement agencies and the military. These companies benefit from historic brand recognition. We believe the Byrna HD is competitively priced and competitive in terms of quality, appearance, features, performance, and reliability, but we need to continue to develop brand awareness in order to stay competitive in each of these areas.
 
We compete for 40mm business with numerous companies in the defense technology industry, including companies with substantially more financial resources than we have, that offer similar products, including, but not limited to, Safariland Group, Combined Systems, Inc. and Pacem Defense. While we believe our BIP product to be excellent in terms of safety and effectiveness, the economic impracticability of a dedicated sales force to market to law enforcement, and our lack of a broad suite of law enforcement products or an integrated software subscription product has stymied market penetration to date.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
The manufacture, sale, and purchase of weapons, ammunitions, firearms, and explosives are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws. We are also subject to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”), and various state and international agencies that control the manufacture, export, import, distribution and sale of ammunition and explosives. Such regulations may adversely affect demand for our products by imposing limitations that increase the costs or limit the availability of our products. In order to manufacture, sell, import and export its 40mm products the Company maintains a Federal Explosives License 20, a Federal Explosives License 23, and a Federal Firearms License 10. The Byrna HD is a new product and may be subject to future legislation or regulation. Because it uses CO2, rather than gunpowder or other explosive to launch projectiles, the Byrna HD is not currently a “firearm” regulated by the ATF. It is, however, subject to certain state and local regulations related to “pepper spray” or “tear gas” devices. Re-characterization of the Byrna HD as a firearm or other changes to or new interpretations of existing regulations could impact our ability to manufacture or sell the Byrna HD and its projectiles, or limit their market, which could impact our cost of sales and demand for Byrna products. Similarly changes in laws related to the domestic or international use of chemical irritants by civilians or law enforcement could impact both our cost of sales and the size of the reachable market.

We are subject, both directly and indirectly, to the adverse impact of existing and potential future government regulation of our products, technology, operations and markets. For example, the development, production, (re-)exportation, importation, and transfer of our products and technology is subject to U.S. and foreign export control, sanctions, customs, import and anti-boycott laws and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations (the “EAR”) (collectively, “Trade Control Laws”). If one or more of our products or technology, or the parts and components we buy from others, is or becomes subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (the “ITAR”) or national security controls or other controls under the EAR, this could significantly impact our operations, for example by severely limiting our ability to sell, (re-)export, or otherwise transfer our products and technology, or to release controlled technology to foreign person employees or others in the United States or abroad. We may not be able to obtain licenses and other authorizations required under the applicable Trade Control Laws. The failure to satisfy the requirements under the Trade Control Laws, including the failure or inability to obtain necessary licenses or qualify for license exceptions, could delay or prevent the development, production, (re-)export, import, and/or in-country transfer of our products and technology, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.
 
Failure by us, our employees, or others working on our behalf to comply with the applicable Trade Control Laws could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including fines, suspension, debarment from bidding for or performing government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We transact with suppliers and others who are exposed to similar risks. Violations of the Trade Control Laws or other applicable laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our products, technology, brand, growth efforts, employees, and business.
 
In addition, our failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations may result in the limitation of our growth or business activities and could result in the revocation of licenses necessary for our business. The importation of materials of and components we use in manufacturing our products and export of finished goods are also subject to extensive federal and international laws and regulations. The handling of our technical data and the international sale of our products may also be regulated by the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. These agencies can impose civil and criminal penalties, including denying us from exporting our products, for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 
We believe that existing federal, state, and local legislation relating to the regulation of firearms and ammunition do not have a material adverse effect on our sales of products. However, the regulation of firearms and ammunition may become more restrictive in the future, and any such developments might have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.
 
Employees
 
As of November 30, 2020, we had approximately 180 employees, including 23 part-time employees. We believe that our employee relations are good, and that our human capital meets the needs of our business.
Corporate History 
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on March 1, 2005 under the name Security Devices International Inc. On February 26, 2020, we filed an amendment to our certificate incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware changing our name, effective March 4, 2020, to Byrna Technologies Inc. During the fiscal year ended November 30, 2020, we had two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Security Devices International Canada Corp (“SDICC”) and Byrna South Africa (Pty) Ltd. SDICC was dissolved effective December 19, 2019.
 
On May 5, 2020, the Company consummated the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Roboro Industries Pty Ltd., a South African private company (“Roboro”). As a result, Roboro became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company utilizes Roboro exclusively as a manufacturing and assembly supplier for its products.
