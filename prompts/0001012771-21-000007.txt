ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
FBL Financial Group, Inc. (we or the Company), majority owned by the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, an Iowa non-profit corporation (IFBF), primarily sells individual life insurance and annuity products through its subsidiary, Farm Bureau Life Insurance Company (Farm Bureau Life). Farm Bureau Life’s distribution force markets under the consumer brand name Farm Bureau Financial Services. In addition, in the state of Colorado, we offer life and annuity products through Greenfields Life Insurance Company (Greenfields). As of December 31, 2020, these distribution channels consisted of 1,614 exclusive agents and agency managers, who sell our products in the Midwestern and Western sections of the United States. Helping complete the financial services offering, advisors offer wealth management and financial planning services.
The Company was incorporated in Iowa in October 1993. Its life insurance subsidiary, Farm Bureau Life, began operations in 1945 and Greenfields, a subsidiary of Farm Bureau Life, was launched in 2013. FBL Wealth Management, LLC began operations in 2019. Other subsidiaries provide support services to our affiliated companies. In addition, we manage all aspects of two Farm Bureau affiliated property-casualty insurance companies (Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Company and Western Agricultural Insurance Company), which operate predominately in eight states in the Midwest and West. 
Merger Agreement
On January 11, 2021, the Company announced that it reached an agreement with Farm Bureau Property & Casualty Insurance Company, an Iowa domiciled stock property and casualty insurance company (FBPCIC), pursuant to which FBPCIC will acquire all of the outstanding Class A common shares, without par value, and Class B common shares, without par value (collectively, the Common Shares), of the Company that are not currently owned or controlled by FBPCIC or IFBF, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement), by and among the Company, FBPCIC, and 5400 Merger Sub, Inc., an Iowa corporation (Merger Sub). IFBF and FBPCIC currently own approximately 61% of the outstanding Common Shares. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger (the Merger). Pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, each outstanding Common Share of the Company (other than shares held by the Company in treasury or by any wholly-owned Company subsidiary, or held by Merger Sub or FBPCIC, or held by holders who have properly exercised dissenters’ rights under applicable Iowa law) will be converted into the right to receive $56.00 per Common Share in cash, without interest and less any required withholding taxes.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain specified closing conditions, including approval by the Company’s shareholders as described below, expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, clearance by the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Iowa and approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The obtaining of financing is not a condition to the obligations of FBPCIC or Merger Sub to effect the Merger. The closing of the Merger is subject to a non-waivable condition that the Merger Agreement be adopted by the affirmative vote of (i) holders of at least a majority of all outstanding Class A common shares and Series B preferred shares, voting together as a single class, (ii) holders of at least a majority of all outstanding Class B common shares and (iii) holders of at least a majority of all outstanding Common Shares held by all of the holders of outstanding Common Shares (excluding IFBF and its affiliates, FBPCIC and its affiliates, and the directors and officers of IFBF, FBPCIC and each of their respective affiliates), in each case, entitled to vote on such matter at a meeting of shareholders duly called and held for such purpose. In addition, FBPCIC’s obligation to consummate the Merger is subject to the condition that no more than 7% of the Common Shares outstanding as of the effective time of the Merger (other than the Common Shares held by FBPCIC, IFBF, certain of their affiliates, their respective subsidiaries, the directors and officers of the foregoing persons and any holders of Common Shares which have failed to perfect, have effectively withdrawn or which otherwise have lost their rights to appraisal under Iowa law) shall have properly demanded and not withdrawn appraisal rights under Iowa law in connection with the Merger, as further described in the Merger Agreement.

Business Strategy
Our core business strategies leverage areas where we have competitive advantages. Our exclusive agent distribution channel enables deep customer engagement and long-term customer relationships. We benefit from close ties to the unique needs of the agricultural market and affinity with the Farm Bureau brand, and our cross-sell culture results in industry leading cross-sell rates. 
Our agents sell property-casualty, life insurance and investment products. Having multi-line agents enhances our ability to develop a more comprehensive relationship with our customers and increases our ability to cross-sell our life insurance, annuity products and wealth management services to the pool of Farm Bureau property-casualty customers.
Our multi-line exclusive agent distribution channel is our foundation and we are defined by our service to the Farm Bureau niche marketplace. We capitalize on the Farm Bureau brand to grow our business and build upon our agricultural and rural market leadership. We focus on consistently improving customer experience and needs-based selling, including a branded review program called SuperCheck. This review program is a free service that helps our customers identify gaps in their insurance coverages and financial needs. We have a broad portfolio of life insurance, annuity and wealth management products so that we have products available to satisfy the needs of our agents and customers. 
Because of their multi-line nature, our agents focus on cross-selling life insurance products to customers who already own a property-casualty policy issued by our property-casualty company partners. For example, in the eight-state region where we manage the affiliated property-casualty insurance companies and related field force (Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota and Utah), 24% of Farm Bureau Financial Services property-casualty policyholders also own a Farm Bureau Life annuity or life product. We are considered among the best-in-industry in cross-sell rates. This percentage is and has historically been higher than the industry average for multi-line exclusive agents, which is 12% according to the most recent research by the Life Insurance and Market Research Association (LIMRA). We believe there is further opportunity for growth from cross-selling as 72% of Farm Bureau members in the eight-state region have a Farm Bureau Financial Services property-casualty insurance product, while only 21% of Farm Bureau members in the eight-state region have a life insurance product with us.
We provide our agents with marketing and sales materials, training and a high level of field management and sales support. Additionally, the field sales support team includes Regional Financial Consultants who work as a resource to help agents with life and annuity sales.
Our sales model is designed so that our agents are entrepreneurial business owners with a retail financial services business. Under this model, our agents have sales and service associates who assist them and provide a variety of support for insurance sales and client/members. 
This business strategy and sales model results in deep customer engagement and long-term customer relationships. Our agents are often viewed as the go-to person for all the insurance needs of their customers. As a result, while we underwrite the majority of the life and annuity products available for sale by our agents, we broker products sold by other carriers when we do not have the expertise, ratings or scale to compete efficiently in the marketplace. Examples of brokered products include long-term care insurance, health insurance and last survivor life policies. We earn fees from the sale of brokered products, a portion of which is passed on to the agents as commissions for the underlying sales. 
In 2018 we began investing in a wealth management strategy which allows us to offer an open architecture mutual fund platform, a fee based investment management platform and financial planning. Prior to that time, we had a limited number of agents who were Investment Advisor Representatives (IARs) and offered fee-based financial planning. We have expanded the advisory services offered by our IARs and added a new role known as the Farm Bureau wealth management advisor. These wealth management advisors have the unique opportunity to partner with our Farm Bureau Financial Services agents for referrals to serve our existing client/members with financial advisory services. Our wealth management services allow our agents to add more value, enhance the customer experience and further strengthen the agent/customer relationship. As of December 31, 2020, we had 36 Farm Bureau wealth management advisors appointed. We intend to continue to add Farm Bureau wealth management advisors who fit our culture and service orientation. We expect that this will ultimately add a diversified earnings stream to FBL Financial Group given the fee-based nature of wealth management. This is a long-term strategy that we expect to invest in and grow over time.
Marketing and Distribution
Market Area
Sales through our distribution channels are currently conducted in 15 states, which we characterize as follows: multi-line states (we own the Farm Bureau affiliated life company and manage the Farm Bureau affiliated property-casualty companies) - Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, South Dakota and Utah; and life partner states (we own the Farm Bureau affiliated life company but non-owned/non-managed Farm Bureau affiliated property-casualty companies manage the exclusive multi-line agents) - Colorado, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Wyoming. 
Our target market is Farm Bureau members and “Middle America.” We traditionally have been very strong in rural and small-town markets and also have a presence in small and mid-metro markets. This target market represents a relatively financially conservative and stable customer base. The financial needs of our target market tend to focus on security, insurance needs and retirement savings. 
Affiliation with Farm Bureau Organizations
Many of our customers are members of Farm Bureau organizations affiliated with the American Farm Bureau Federation (American Farm Bureau). The American Farm Bureau is the nation’s largest grassroots farm and ranch organization and has a current membership of 5.8 million member families. In order to market insurance products in a given state using the “Farm 
Bureau” and “FB” designations, related trademarks and service marks, a company must have an agreement with the state’s Farm Bureau organization. Generally, these marketing rights have only been granted to companies owned by or closely affiliated with Farm Bureau organizations. For each of the states in our Farm Bureau marketing territory, which excludes Colorado, we have the right to use the “Farm Bureau” name and “FB” logo for marketing life insurance and investment products. There are approximately 712,000 member families in the states where we have rights to use the Farm Bureau name, brand and logo. 
All of the state Farm Bureau organizations in our marketing area are associated with the American Farm Bureau. The primary goal of the American Farm Bureau is to be the unified national voice of agriculture, working through its grassroots organization to enhance and strengthen the lives of rural Americans and to build strong, prosperous agricultural communities. There are currently Farm Bureau organizations in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, each with their own distinctive mission and goals. Within each state, Farm Bureau is organized at the county level. Farm Bureau programs may include policy development, government relations activities, leadership development and training, communications outreach and training, market education, commodity conferences and young farmer activities. Member services provided by Farm Bureau vary by state but often include programs such as risk management, alternative energy development, farm transition workshops, rural entrepreneurial seminars, scholarships and grants and guidance on enhancing profitability. Other benefits of membership include newspaper and magazine subscriptions, as well as savings in areas such as health care, travel, entertainment, farm equipment and automobile rebates. In addition, members have access to accidental death insurance, banking services, computerized farm accounting services, electronic information networks, health care insurance or benefit plans, property-casualty insurance and financial services.
The American Farm Bureau may terminate our right to use the “Farm Bureau” and “FB” designations in our states (i) in the event of a material breach of the trademark license that we do not cure within 60 days, (ii) immediately in the event of termination by the American Farm Bureau of the state Farm Bureau’s membership in the American Farm Bureau or (iii) in the event of a material breach of the state Farm Bureau organization’s membership agreement with the American Farm Bureau, including by reason of the failure of the state Farm Bureau to cause us to adhere to the American Farm Bureau’s policies. 
We have royalty agreements with each state Farm Bureau organization in our Farm Bureau marketing territory giving us the right to use the Farm Bureau and FB designations in that particular state. Each state Farm Bureau organization in our Farm Bureau territory could terminate our right to use the Farm Bureau designations in that particular state without cause at the conclusion of the royalty agreements. The royalties paid to a particular state Farm Bureau organization are based on the sale of our products in the respective state. For 2020, royalty expense totaled approximately $2.3 million. 
Our relationship with Farm Bureau organizations provides a number of advantages. Farm Bureau organizations in our marketing territory tend to be well known and long established, have active memberships and provide a number of member benefits other than financial services. The strength of these organizations provides enhanced prestige and brand awareness for our products and increased access to Farm Bureau members, which results in a competitive advantage for us. 
Our life insurance and investment products are available for sale to both Farm Bureau members and non-members. Property-casualty products sold by the property-casualty insurance companies affiliated with Farm Bureau are available for sale to Farm Bureau members. Annual Farm Bureau memberships in our marketing territory average $58 and are available to individuals, families, partnerships and corporations.
We have service agreements with all of our property-casualty company partners in our marketing area, pursuant to which the property-casualty companies provide certain services, which include recruiting and training the shared agency force that sells both property-casualty products for that company and life products for us. The service agreements have expiration dates through December 31, 2029. In 2020, we paid $8.4 million for the services provided under these agreements. 
Our Advisory Committee, which consists of executives of the property-casualty insurance company partners in our marketing territory, assists us in our relationships with the property-casualty organizations and the Farm Bureau organization leaders in their respective states. The Advisory Committee meets on a regular basis to coordinate efforts and issues involving the agency force and other matters. The Advisory Committee is an important contributor to our success in marketing products through our distribution system.

Agency Force
Our agency force is one of our most important competitive advantages as the agents are able to develop long term personal relationships through a deep understanding of their customers’ needs. Our priority is to ensure that we have best-in-class distribution systems and support, including agent recruiting and retention, training and leadership. Our agents are independent contractors and exclusive agents. We have a written contract with each member of our agency force. The contract covers a number of topics including privacy, compensation payments and reserving our ownership of customer lists. 
In the multi-line states where we manage the Farm Bureau affiliated property-casualty companies, our agents are supervised by agency managers employed by FBPCIC. There are 953 agents and managers in our multi-line states. These agents market a full range of our life insurance and annuity products. They also market products for the property-casualty companies that we manage. These agents are supported by 1,185 sales associates who assist them and provide a variety of support in the sales process. We are responsible for product and sales training for all lines of business in our multi-line states.
In our life partner states, our life insurance and annuity products are marketed by agents that we share with our property-casualty company partners in that state. There are 661 agents and managers in our life partner states. These agents market our life and annuity products and market the property-casualty products of that state’s affiliated property-casualty company. We are responsible for training the agency force in life insurance products and sales methods in our life partner states.
Sales activities of our agents focus on personal contact and on cross-selling life and annuity products to the existing property-casualty customers. The Farm Bureau name recognition and access to Farm Bureau membership provides opportunities for additional customers, cross-selling of additional insurance products and increased retention. 
The focus of agency managers is to recruit, train, supervise and retain agents to achieve high production levels of profitable business. Agency manager compensation is comprised of 1) overwrite commissions, which vary according to the productivity level and persistency of business of the agents managed and 2) a reward related to the attainment of sales goals. In some growth markets where the agent population is small, we have a compensation program comprised of salary and overwrite commissions. These managers are expected to transition to full overwrite commissions as the agency grows population. This compensation structure aligns with the requirements of the agency manager role and offers a financial incentive that aligns with the strategic priorities of growing both agency scale and productivity. 
We structure our agents’ life products compensation system to encourage production and persistency. Agents receive commissions for new life insurance and annuity sales and service fees on premium payments in subsequent years. Production bonuses are paid based on the premium level of new life business written in the prior 12 months and the persistency of the business written by the agent. Persistency is a common measure used in life insurance, which measures the quality and the consistent payment of premiums and is included in calculating the bonus to either increase or decrease (or even eliminate) the agent’s production bonus. We are willing to pay added incentives for higher volumes of business only as long as the business is profitable. Production bonuses allow agents to increase their compensation significantly. 
We have a variety of incentives and recognition programs to focus agents on production of quality life insurance business. Some recognition programs and incentives are jointly conducted with the property-casualty companies. These programs provide significant incentives for the most productive agents. Approximately 12% of our agents and agency managers qualify for our primary annual incentive trip. Agent recruiting, training, financing and compensation programs are designed to develop a productive agent for the long term. 
In order to increase an agent’s opportunity for success and increase retention, we offer a developing agent program in which the agent completes a training program that can take up to four months and achieves certain production minimums on a part-time basis before being contracted as a full-time agent. This program gives us and the agent an opportunity to assess whether the candidate is expected to have a successful long-term career as our agent. The developing agent program, along with new agent financing, centralized training, a quality recruiting/selection process and a strong field leadership team are designed to strengthen our distribution and improve agent retention. Our four-year agency force retention rate for 2020 was approximately 20%. 
Business Segments
We analyze operations by reviewing financial information regarding our primary products that are aggregated into the Annuity and Life Insurance product segments. In addition, our Corporate and Other segment includes our developing wealth management business along with various support operations, corporate capital, brokered insurance and investment products and closed blocks of variable insurance products no longer underwritten by the Company.
See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Segment Information” included in Item 7 for additional information regarding our financial results by operating segment. Included in the following discussion of our segments are details regarding premiums. We use premiums collected to measure the productivity of our exclusive agents. Premiums collected is not a measure used in financial statements prepared according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements also includes a discussion of the most comparable GAAP financial measures and, as applicable, a reconciliation to such GAAP measures. 
Annuity Segment
We sell a variety of traditional annuity products through our exclusive agency force. The Annuity segment primarily consists of fixed rate and indexed annuities and supplementary contracts (some of which involve life contingencies). Traditional annuities provide for tax-deferred savings and supplementary contracts provide for the systematic repayment of funds that accumulate interest.

Total Annuity | $ | 182,317 | | | $ | 251,971 | | $ | 285,438

Annuity premiums collected decreased in 2020 and 2019, compared to prior periods, due to decreased sales of our fixed rate deferred and indexed annuity products, as sales were negatively impacted by crediting and cap rate reductions in response to declining market and portfolio yields. The amount of traditional annuity premiums collected is highly dependent upon the relationship between the current crediting rates on our products and the perceived security of our products compared to those of competing products. Traditional annuity premiums collected in our Farm Bureau market territory in 2020 were concentrated primarily in the states of Iowa (31%), Kansas (23%) and Nebraska (8%). 
Fixed Rate Annuities
We offer annuities that are marketed to individuals in anticipation of retirement. We offer traditional annuities in the form of flexible premium deferred annuities (FPDA) that allow policyholders to make contributions over a number of periods. For traditional annuity products, policyholder account balances are credited interest at rates that we determine subject to a guaranteed minimum. The annuitant may elect to take the proceeds of the annuity either in a single payment or in a series of payments for life, for a fixed number of years, for a fixed amount, or a combination of these options.
In addition to FPDAs, we also market single premium deferred annuities (SPDA) and single premium immediate annuity (SPIA) products, which feature a single premium paid when the contract is issued. Benefit payments and the surrender charge structure on SPDA contracts are similar to other fixed rate annuities. Benefit payments on SPIAs begin immediately after the issuance of the contract. 
Approximately 45% of our existing individual traditional annuity business, based on account balances, is held in qualified retirement plans. For deferred annuity products, in order to encourage persistency, a surrender charge is imposed against the policyholder’s account balance for early termination of the annuity contract within a specified period after its effective date. The surrender charge structure varies by product, but typically starts at 6% to 10% and decreases 1% to 2% per year until it reaches 0%.

We invest the premiums we receive from fixed rate annuities. The assets reside in our general account. Acquisition costs are paid from the general account as they arise. The difference between the yield we earn on our investment portfolio and the interest we credit on our fixed rate annuities is known as the spread. The spread is a major driver of the profitability for all of our traditional annuity products.
Interest Crediting Policy
We have a rate setting committee that meets monthly, or more frequently if required, to review and establish current period interest rates based upon existing and anticipated investment opportunities. This applies to new sales and to annuity products after an initial guaranteed period. We examine earnings on assets by portfolio. We then establish rates based on each product’s target spread and competitive market conditions at the time. Most of our annuity contracts have guaranteed minimum crediting rates. These rates range from 1.00% to 5.50%, with a weighted average guaranteed crediting rate of 2.09% at December 31, 2020 and 2.11% at December 31, 2019. The average interest rate guarantees on annuity contracts issued during 2020 was 1.00%.
Indexed Annuities 
With an indexed annuity, the policyholder may choose from a traditional fixed rate strategy or an indexed strategy, with the underlying index being the S&P 500®. The product requires crediting of interest and a reset of the index annually. The computation of the index credit is based upon either a point-to-point calculation (i.e., the gain in the index from the beginning of the contract year to the next reset date) or a monthly averaging of the index during the period, subject to a cap. This product allows contract holders to re-allocate funds among the indexed accounts and a traditional fixed rate strategy at the end of each reset period. It includes a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit rider. If activated by the policyholder, the rider provides a minimum amount that is available for withdrawal at specified withdrawal rates even if the accumulated value goes to zero. There is an additional annual charge for the activated rider. 
A new indexed annuity was introduced in 2020. This new product is a single premium deferred indexed annuity featuring a 2-year point-to-point strategy and a fixed rate interest account with a 6-year schedule of surrender charges. Initial premium goes into the fixed account until the initial sweep date. During the surrender charge period, all of the account value is allocated
to the 2-year point-to-point indexed strategy, which offers capped returns linked to the S&P 500 index. The product credits interest and resets the index biennially. This product has a bailout withdrawal feature under which the contract holder may elect to surrender the contract without surrender charges if renewal cap rates are set below a bailout cap rate established at issue.
The indexed annuity contract value is equal to the premiums paid less partial withdrawals and rider charges taken from the contract plus interest credited to the fixed portion of the contract and index credits on the indexed portion of the contract. The minimum guaranteed contract values are equal to 87.5% of the premium collected, adjusted for withdrawals and rider charges, plus interest credited annually at the standard nonforfeiture rate, which is currently 1.0%. If there were little or no indexed credits over the life of an indexed annuity, we would incur expenses to increase the account value to the minimum guaranteed contract values. 
Indexed annuity premiums are invested in our general account similar to fixed rate annuities. A portion of the investments are used to purchase call options on the S&P 500 to fund the index credits on the accounts. New call options are purchased at each reset date. The cost of the call options is managed through the terms of the indexed annuities, which permit changes to caps, subject to minimum guarantees. Our spread is also influenced by the aggregate call option costs. Additionally, if we are not successful in matching the terms of the call options with the terms of the indexed annuities, the call option proceeds could vary from the indexed credits, thus increasing or reducing aggregate call option costs and causing spreads to widen or tighten.
Withdrawal Rates
Withdrawal rates (excluding death benefits) for our individual deferred annuities were 4.6% for 2020, 5.7% for 2019 and 5.3% for 2018. The individual annuity withdrawal rate decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, partially due to the suspension of required minimum distributions by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The individual annuity withdrawal rate increased in 2019, compared to 2018, due to certain policies reaching the end of their interest rate guarantee period and the competitiveness of our current crediting rates relative to other financial institutions.

Life premiums collected were higher in 2020 and 2019 compared to the prior years due to increased sales of universal life and term life policies. These increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of whole life. Life insurance premiums collected in our market territory in 2020 were concentrated primarily in the states of Iowa (24%), Kansas (14%) and Oklahoma (9%). 
Traditional Life Insurance
We offer whole life insurance, which provides benefits for the life of the insured. Whole life insurance provides level premiums and a level death benefit and requires payments in excess of mortality costs in early years to offset increasing mortality costs in later years. We currently offer a non-participating whole life insurance product. Prior to May 2019, we offered participating whole life insurance. Under the terms of the participating whole life policies, policyholders have a right to participate in the overall performance of the participating life block to the extent determined by Farm Bureau Life, generally through annual dividends. Participating business accounted for 24% of direct life premiums collected from policyholders during 2020 and represented 9% of life insurance in force at December 31, 2020. 
We also market nonparticipating term insurance policies that provide life insurance protection for a specified period. Term insurance is mortality based and generally has no cash value. However, we also offer a return of premium term product, which returns a percentage of premiums after a set number of years. For a portion of our business, we may change the premium scales at any time but may not increase rates above guaranteed levels. In addition to our level face amount term products, we also offer an increasing face amount term product. Our increasing term life insurance product allows for scheduled increases of 20% of the initial face amount on the first five anniversaries. Premiums during the specified period increase as the face amount of the policy increases. 
Universal Life Insurance
Our universal life policies provide permanent life insurance protection which allows the customer to pre-fund future insurance costs and accumulate savings on a tax-deferred basis. Premiums received, less policy assessments for administration expenses and mortality costs, are credited to the policyholder’s account balance. Interest is credited to the cash value at rates that we periodically set. 
Our indexed universal life insurance product provides life insurance protection with flexible premium payments and provides a death benefit with cash accumulation. The premium is paid into a holding account and once it is fully funded with a year’s worth of policy charges, the excess value is transferred into an indexed segment or a fixed account, according to the selected allocation. The fixed and holding accounts are credited interest at a rate declared by the Company. The value in the indexed segment earns interest based on the percentage change in the S&P 500. A quarterly review is conducted to determine whether the holding account contains 12 months’ worth of policy charges. We purchase one-year call options on the S&P 500 to fund the indexed segment credits. Interest on each of the indexed segments is credited annually on a point-to-point basis. After any annual earned interest is credited to an indexed segment, the money is transferred back to the holding account where it can become eligible for a new indexed segment. Positive interest credit is subject to a cap. If the ending index value is less than the initial index value, the interest credit will be zero. 
At the end of 2020 we discontinued new sales of a universal life with secondary guarantee product that provided life insurance protection with flexible premium payments and fully guaranteed interest, cost of insurance charges and other expenses. The policy was structured to remain in force for the guaranteed period even if the surrender value of the policy was zero, as long as the planned premiums were paid on time. 
Underwriting 
We follow formal underwriting standards and procedures designed to properly assess and quantify life insurance risks before issuing policies to individuals. To implement these procedures, we employ an underwriting staff of 9 underwriters who have an average of 15 years of experience in the insurance industry. We also utilize technology and automation to provide additional data to improve future risk selection.
Our underwriters review each application, which is prepared under the supervision of our agents, and supported by any required testing and records: blood or urine testing, paramedical/physicians’ examinations, motor vehicle, pharmacological reports, inspection reports, data elements and medical records. We generally begin employing paramedical exams, blood and urine testing (including HIV antibody testing) whenever the applicant is at least 18 and at face amounts of at least $500,000. Additional underwriting requirements and inspection reports are required as either the face amount or the age of the proposed insured increases. Based on available information, we may adjust the mortality charge or decline coverage completely.
In 2017, we began an accelerated underwriting program on a pilot basis. This program was a non-medical underwriting approach that included a variety of data sources as part of the evaluation process. This pilot program was available only for ages 18 to 59 and for face amounts of $100,000 to $250,000. Based on what we learned from this pilot program, we made various refinements to this process and in September of 2020, we introduced a formal accelerated underwriting program. This program is available for ages 18-60 and for face amounts of $100,000 to $500,000. This process incorporates application information and motor vehicle, pharmacological and other data elements. 
Generally, tobacco use by a life insurance applicant within the preceding one-year period results in a substantially higher mortality charge. In accordance with industry practice, material misrepresentation on a policy application can result in the cancellation of the policy upon the return of any premiums paid. In 2018, we introduced a new life insurance underwriting rating for smokeless tobacco users. Previously, customers who used chewing tobacco were classified under the smokers’ rate. 
During 2020, we adjusted and refined our underwriting guidelines due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These include the expansion of requirements for policy delivery, allowance of video conferencing, scrutiny of recent travel and restrictions on underwriting policies involving applicants with a positive COVID-19 test. We continue to review and update these guidelines as appropriate. 
Interest Crediting and Participating Dividend Policy
The interest crediting policy for our life insurance products is the same as for our traditional annuity products in the Annuity segment. See “Interest Crediting Policy” under the Annuity Segment discussion. We pay dividends, credit interest and determine other nonguaranteed elements on the individual insurance policies depending on the type of product. Some elements, such as dividends, are generally declared for a year at a time. Interest rates and other nonguaranteed elements are determined based on experience as it emerges and with regard to competitive factors. Weighted average contractual credited rates on our universal life contracts were 3.18% in 2020, 3.31% in 2019 and 3.38% in 2018. Our universal life contracts have guaranteed minimum crediting rates that range from 1.00% to 4.50%, with a weighted average guaranteed crediting rate of 3.36% at December 31, 2020 and 3.42% at December 31, 2019.

Policyholder dividends are paid as declared on participating policies. Policyholder dividend scales are generally established annually and are based on the performance of assets supporting these policies, the mortality experience of the policies, expense levels and other factors. Our participating business does not have minimum guaranteed dividend rates.

Corporate and Other Segment
The Corporate and Other segment includes (i) wealth management services; (ii) advisory services for the management of investments for other companies; (iii) a management fee for managing the affiliated property-casualty companies; (iv) marketing and distribution services for the sale of mutual funds and insurance products not issued by us; (v) leasing services with affiliates; (vi) closed blocks of variable annuity, variable life and accident and health products; (vii) interest expense and (viii) investments and related investment income not specifically allocated to our product segments. 
Wealth management services include the offering of financial planning, investment advisory and full-service brokerage services. We offer a personal and comprehensive approach to wealth management and have access to a broad selection of investment products and retail mutual funds. Revenues are primarily derived from fee-based advisory services and commissions from sales of mutual funds, debt and equity securities. 
We previously issued our own variable products, but in 2010 discontinued underwriting new sales. The existing in force business remains on our books and we continue to administer this business. Variable premiums collected from prior sales were $45.0 million in 2020, $48.0 million in 2019 and $50.0 million in 2018.
Reinsurance
We reinsure a portion of our life insurance exposure with unaffiliated insurance companies under traditional indemnity reinsurance agreements. New sales of life products are reinsured above prescribed limits and do not require the reinsurer’s prior approval within certain guidelines. We do not use financial or surplus relief reinsurance. We enter into indemnity reinsurance arrangements to assist in diversifying our risks and to limit our maximum loss on risks that exceed our policy retention limits. Our current maximum retention limit on an insured life is $1.0 million. 
Reinsurance contracts do not fully discharge our obligation to pay claims on the reinsured business. As the ceding insurer, we remain responsible for policy claims to the extent the reinsurer fails to pay claims. No reinsurer of business ceded by us has failed to pay any material policy claims (either individually or in the aggregate) with respect to our ceded business. We continually evaluate the financial strength of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk. If for any reason reinsurance coverages would need to be replaced, we believe that replacement coverages from financially responsible reinsurers would be available.

Ratings and Competition
Financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. Insurer financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to meet its financial obligations to policyholders and contract holders. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an issuer’s ability to repay its indebtedness. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency, and therefore, no assurance can be given that a rating will be maintained. 
As of the date of this filing, Farm Bureau Life’s A.M. Best financial strength rating is “A” (Excellent) with a stable outlook and its long-term issuer credit rating is “a+” with a stable outlook. FBL Financial Group’s A.M. Best long-term issuer credit rating is “bbb+” with a stable outlook.
A.M. Best has 16 financial strength ratings assigned to insurance companies, which currently range from A++ (Superior) to S (Suspended). A.M. Best’s issuer credit ratings range from aaa (exceptional) to d (in default). A “+” or “-“ may be appended to ratings from aa to ccc to indicate relative position within a category. A rating of bbb- or above is considered investment grade. As of the date of this filing, A.M. Best has the life/annuity industry on a negative rating outlook. 
We operate in a highly competitive industry. Insurers compete based primarily upon price, service level and the financial strength of the company. The operating results of companies in the insurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations due to competition, economic conditions, interest rates, investment performance, maintenance of insurance ratings from rating agencies and other factors. We believe our ability to compete with other insurance companies is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to attract and retain agents to market our insurance products, our ability to develop competitive and profitable products and our ability to maintain good or better ratings from rating agencies. In connection with the development and sale of our products, we encounter significant competition from other insurance companies and other financial institutions, such as banks and broker/dealers, many of which have financial resources substantially greater than ours.
Regulation
All segments of our business are highly regulated. See Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Human Capital Resources
At December 31, 2020, FBL Financial Group had 1,754 full-time employees. They, along with approximately 135 part-time and temporary staff, work from ten corporate offices in eight states. A majority of our employees, including the executive officers, also provide services to FBPCIC and other affiliates pursuant to management agreements. None of our employees are members of a collective bargaining unit. 
FBL’s ability to attract, develop, and retain employees is critical to our growth and success. The stated purpose of our organization is: “We protect livelihoods and futures.” Six corporate values ― integrity, accountability, service, teamwork, leadership, and passion ― are foundational to this purpose. 
We offer comprehensive benefits to our employees, including maternity, paternity and adoption leave, adoption assistance, health, dental, vision and disability insurance, company-paid life insurance, a company match 401(k) retirement savings plan and paid volunteer time off (VTO). 
We also provide opportunities for personal and professional advancement: education and training, tuition reimbursement, mentorship, leadership development, and health and wellness programs. Our corporate headquarters includes a wellness facility, medical clinic, cafeteria and childcare center. To assess and improve employee retention and engagement, we annually survey employees and take actions to address areas of employee concern.
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 we transitioned to a mostly work-from-home environment, increased cleaning protocols in all locations, initiated regular communication reminders about health and safety procedures and established new physical distancing procedures for employees working onsite.
