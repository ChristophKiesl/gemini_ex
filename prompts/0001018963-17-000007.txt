Our Business
ATI is a global manufacturer of technically advanced specialty materials and complex components. Over 50% of our sales are to the aerospace & defense market, particularly jet engines, and we have a strong presence in the oil & gas, electrical energy, medical, automotive, and other industrial markets. ATI is a market leader in manufacturing differentiated specialty alloys and forgings that require our unique manufacturing and precision machining capabilities and our innovative new product development competence. ATI produces nickel-based alloys and superalloys, titanium and titanium-based alloys, specialty alloys, stainless steels, and zirconium and other related alloys in many mill product forms. Our capabilities range from alloy development, to melting and hot-working, through highly engineered finished components. We are also a leader in producing nickel-based alloy and titanium-based alloy powders for use in next-generation jet engine forgings and 3D-printed products. 
We operate in two business segments: High Performance Materials & Components (HPMC), and Flat Rolled Products (FRP). Our HPMC segment produces, converts and distributes a wide range of high performance materials, including titanium and titanium-based alloys, nickel- and cobalt-based alloys and superalloys, zirconium and related alloys including hafnium and niobium, advanced powder alloys and other specialty materials, in long product forms such as ingot, billet, bar, rod, wire, shapes and rectangles, and seamless tubes, plus precision forgings, castings, components and machined parts. These products are designed for the high performance requirements of major end markets such as aerospace & defense, oil & gas, electrical energy, and medical. Our FRP segment produces, converts and distributes stainless steel, nickel-based alloys, specialty alloys, and titanium and titanium-based alloys, in a variety of product forms including plate, sheet, engineered strip, and Precision Rolled Strip products. The major end markets for our flat-rolled products are oil & gas, automotive, food processing equipment and appliances, construction and mining, electronics, communication equipment and computers, and aerospace & defense.
ATI’s strategic vision is to be an aligned and integrated specialty materials and components company. Our strategies target the products and global growth markets that require and value ATI’s technical and manufacturing capability leadership. These differentiated products serve key global markets including aerospace & defense, oil & gas, electrical energy, medical and automotive, and sales to these key global markets represented 80% of total 2016 sales.
More than 50% of ATI’s 2016 sales, and 75% of the HPMC segment’s 2016 sales, are to the aerospace & defense market, led by products for commercial aerospace jet engines. Through acquisitions, alloy development, internal growth strategies, and long-term supply agreements on current and next-generation aero-engines and airframes, we are well positioned with a fully qualified asset base to meet the expected multi-year growth in demand from the commercial aerospace market. Our HPMC segment’s isothermal and hot-die forge press utilization continues to improve to meet aerospace demand growth, including new market share gains.
Strategic end use markets for our products include:
Aerospace & Defense. We are a world leader in the production of premium titanium-based alloys, nickel-based and cobalt-based alloys and superalloys, and vacuum-melted specialty alloys used in the manufacture of components for both commercial and military jet engines, as well as replacement parts for those engines. We also produce titanium-based alloys, vacuum-melted specialty alloys, and high-strength stainless alloys for use in commercial and military airframes, airframe components and missiles.
Titanium and titanium-based alloys are critical metals in aerospace and defense applications. They possess an extraordinary combination of properties, including superior strength-to-weight ratio, elevated temperature resistance, low coefficient of thermal expansion, and extreme corrosion resistance. These metals are used to produce jet engine components such as blades, vanes, discs, and casings, and airframe components such as structural members, landing gear, hydraulic systems, and fasteners. The latest and next-generation airframes and jet engines use increasing amounts of titanium and titanium alloys in component parts in order to minimize weight and maximize fuel efficiency.
Our nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty alloys are also widely used in aerospace and defense applications. Nickel-based alloys and superalloys remain extremely strong at high temperatures and resist degradation under extreme 
 3

conditions. Typical aerospace applications for nickel-based alloys and superalloys and advanced powder alloys include jet engine shafts, discs, blades, vanes, rings and casings. The next generation and future-generation jet engines use new generations of nickel-based superalloys and advanced powder alloys in large part due to increased fuel efficiency requirements that require hotter-burning engines. Our specialty alloys include vacuum-melted maraging steels used in the manufacture of aircraft landing gear and structural components, as well as jet engine components.
Our titanium-based alloy, nickel-based alloy, and specialty alloy precision forgings are used for components for jet engines, structural components for aircraft, helicopters, launch vehicles, and other demanding applications. We are a world leader in isothermal and hot-die forging technologies for advanced aerospace components.  We produce highly sophisticated components that have differing mechanical properties in different parts of the same piece for greater resistance to fatigue and temperature effects. ATI provides a full range of post-forging inspection, machining and finishing services with the certified quality needed to meet demanding application requirements.  ATI has the technology, equipment and know-how to cast titanium parts in some of the largest sizes and most complex shapes currently being manufactured for aerospace applications. ATI’s advanced manufacturing capabilities offer OEMs the freedom to design components with intricate geometries, cored passageways, cast-in features and sculpted surfaces.  
ATI’s powder metal technology delivers extreme alloy compositions and refined microstructures that offer increased performance and longer useful lives in high-temperature aerospace environments.  Powder metal technology boosts the efficiency of jet engines. Powder delivers the most uniform grain structure achievable, in near-net shapes. We are expanding our powder metal production capacity in Bakers, NC to better serve these markets, and we expect to qualify these assets with key strategic customers and increase our sales of these products in 2017.
We continuously seek to develop innovative new alloys to better serve the needs of this end use market. For example, ATI 718Plus® nickel-based superalloy, Rene 65 near-powder superalloy, and our powder alloys have won significant share in the current and next-generation jet engines.
Oil & Gas. The environments in which oil and gas can be found in commercial quantities have become more challenging, involving deep offshore wells, high pressure and high temperature conditions in sour wells and unconventional sources, such as shale oil and gas, and oil sands. Challenging offshore environments are in deepwater remote locations that are further off the continental shelf, including arctic and tropical locations, often one mile or more below the water’s surface, and up to two miles below the ocean floor. The requirements for equipment that can operate for up to 30 years in these environments are fulfilled by the specialty materials that we produce.
Both of our business segments produce specialty materials that are critical to the oil and gas industry. Our specialty materials, including titanium and titanium-based alloys, nickel-based alloys, zirconium alloys, stainless and duplex alloys and other specialty alloys have the strength, wear corrosion-resistant properties necessary for difficult environments. 
Our Datalloy2® and DatalloyHP™ specialty stainless is used for non-magnetic drill collars that enable the most advanced directional and horizontal drilling techniques to be guided to the exact position desired for the reservoir. We have developed a family of duplex alloys, including ATI 2003® and ATI 2102® lean duplex alloys, for use in subsea and deepwater oil and gas applications. Several of our strip, plate and cast products are NORSOK qualified. The NORSOK standards are developed by the Norwegian petroleum industry and are intended to identify materials used in oil and gas applications that are safe and cost-effective.
Electrical Energy. Our specialty materials are widely used in the global electrical power generation and distribution industry. We believe energy needs and environmental policies and the electrification of developing countries will continue to drive demand for our specialty materials and products for use in this industry.
For electrical power generation, our specialty materials, including corrosion-resistant alloys (CRAs), are used in coal, nuclear, and natural gas applications. In coal-fired plants, our CRAs are used for pipe, tube, and heat exchanger applications in water systems in addition to pollution control scrubbers. Our CRAs are also used in water systems, fuel cladding components, and process equipment for nuclear power plants. For nuclear power plants, we are an industry pioneer in producing reactor-grade zirconium and hafnium alloys used in nuclear fuel cladding and structural components. We are a technology leader for large diameter nickel-based superalloys used in natural gas land-based turbines for power generation. For alternative energy generation, our alloys are used for solar, fuel cell and geothermal applications. 
Medical. ATI’s advanced specialty materials are used in medical device products that save and enhance the quality of lives.
Our zirconium-niobium, titanium- and cobalt-based alloys are used for knees, hips and other prosthetic devices. These replacement devices offer the potential of lasting much longer than previous implant options.

Our biocompatible nickel-titanium shape memory alloy is used for stents to support collapsed or clogged blood vessels. Reduced in diameter for insertion, these stents expand to the original tube-like shape due to the metal’s superelasticity. Our ultra fine diameter (0.002 inch/0.051 mm) titanium wire is used for screens to prevent blood clots from entering critical areas of the body. In addition, our titanium bar and wire are used to make surgical screws for bone repairs.
Manufacturers of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices rely on our niobium superconducting wire to help produce electromagnetic fields that allow physicians to safely scan the body’s soft tissue. 
Automotive. For automobiles, nickel-based alloys, stainless steel and other ATI specialty materials are the choice for powertrain and structural parts, exhaust system and emission control parts, gaskets, air bag inflator housings, windshield wipers and blades, fuel systems, fasteners, hose clamps, gaskets and other components. Stainless steel is also used on exterior trim for its bright appearance and for internal components for its corrosion resistance.
ATI’s advanced nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys in flat-rolled products are used primarily in engine and exhaust applications in the automotive market.  Global demand is expected to grow for our high-value precision and engineered strip for automotive applications such as gaskets, hose clamps, and turbo chargers.  As automotive engine operating temperatures get hotter as a result of turbochargers, we bring our expertise in aerospace alloys to the automotive market, and our alloy mix continues to trend favorably.  Our HRPF provides the capability to produce these high-value alloys in wider and longer coils.  
We also provide a variety of heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant automotive exhaust alloys.  Again, in this application we focus on those exhaust applications that are closer to the engine where exhaust temperatures are highest and corrosion resistance is most severe.
Business Segments
Our two business segments accounted for the following percentages of total revenues of $3.13 billion, $3.72 billion, and $4.22 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
High Performance Materials & Components | 62 | % | | 53 | % | 48 | %
Flat Rolled Products | 38 | % | | 47 | % | 52 | %

Information with respect to our business segments is presented below and in Note 16 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
High Performance Materials & Components Segment
Our HPMC segment produces, converts and distributes a wide range of high performance materials, including titanium and titanium-based alloys, nickel- and cobalt-based alloys and superalloys, zirconium and related alloys including hafnium and niobium, advanced powder alloys and other specialty materials, in long product forms such as ingot, billet, bar, rod, wire, shapes and rectangles, and seamless tubes, plus precision forgings and castings, components and machined parts. These products are designed for the high performance requirements of such major end markets as aerospace & defense (jet engines and airframes), oil & gas, electrical energy, and medical. We are integrated across these alloy systems in melt, remelt, mill product forging, finishing, investment casting, and machining processes. Most of the products in this segment are sold directly to end-use customers, and a significant portion of our HPMC segment products are sold under multi-year agreements. 
75% of the HPMC segment’s 2016 revenues were derived from the aerospace & defense market. Demand for our products is driven primarily by the commercial aerospace cycle. Large aircraft and jet engines are manufactured by a small number of companies, such as The Boeing Company, Airbus S.A.S. (an Airbus Group company), Bombardier Aerospace (a division of Bombardier Inc.), and Embraer (Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica S.A.) for airframes, and GE Aviation (a division of General Electric Company), Rolls-Royce plc, Pratt & Whitney (a division of United Technologies Corporation), Snecma (SAFRAN Group), and various joint ventures that manufacture jet engines. These companies and their suppliers form a substantial part of our customer base in this business segment. The loss of one or more of our customers in the aerospace & defense market could have a material adverse effect on ATI’s results of operations and financial condition.
Principal competitors in the HPMC segment include Berkshire Hathaway Inc., for nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty steel alloys, titanium and titanium-based alloys, precision forgings and investment castings through its recent acquisition of Precision Castparts Corporation and subsidiaries; Arconic Inc., for titanium and titanium-based alloys and precision forgings through its recent acquisitions of RTI International Metals, Inc. and Firth Rixson; Carpenter Technology Corporation for nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty steel alloys; VSMPO-AVISMA for titanium and titanium-based alloys; and Aubert & Duval for precision forgings.

Flat Rolled Products Segment
Our FRP segment produces, converts and distributes stainless steel, nickel-based alloys, specialty alloys, and titanium and titanium-based alloys, in a variety of product forms including plate, sheet, engineered strip, and Precision Rolled Strip® products. The major end markets for our flat-rolled products are oil & gas, automotive, aerospace & defense, food processing equipment and appliances, construction and mining, electronics, communication equipment and computers. The operations in this segment are ATI Flat Rolled Products and the Chinese joint venture company known as Shanghai STAL Precision Stainless Steel Company Limited (STAL), in which we hold a 60% interest. Segment results also include our 50% interest in the industrial titanium joint venture known as Uniti LLC. 
Stainless steel, nickel-based alloys and titanium sheet products are used in a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications. In 2016, approximately 65% by volume of our stainless sheet products were sold to independent service centers, which have slitting, cutting or other processing facilities, with the remainder sold directly to end-use customers.
Engineered strip and very thin Precision Rolled Strip products, which are under 0.015 inches thick, are used by customers to fabricate a variety of products primarily in the automotive, construction, and electronics markets. In 2016, approximately 90% by volume of our engineered strip and Precision Rolled Strip products were sold directly to end-use customers or through our own distribution network, with the remainder sold to independent service centers.
Stainless steel, nickel-based alloy and titanium plate products are primarily used in aerospace, corrosion and industrial markets. In 2016, approximately one-half by volume of our plate products were sold to independent service centers, with the remainder sold directly to end-use customers.
Competition in the Flat Rolled Products segment includes domestic stainless steel competitors AK Steel Corporation, North American Stainless, and Outokumpu Stainless USA, LLC, as well as imports from numerous foreign producers, including Aperam, based in Europe. Competitors for nickel-based alloys and superalloys and specialty steel alloys include Haynes International and VDM Metals GmbH. 
Significant global overcapacity for stainless steel flat-rolled products has intensified the price competition in this segment over the last several years. Some of our foreign competitors are either directly or indirectly subsidized by governments. In 1999, the United States imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on dumped and subsidized imports of stainless steel sheet and strip in coils and stainless steel plate in coils from companies in ten foreign countries. The anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders were reviewed in 2011 by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission to determine whether the orders should remain in place for another five years. The agencies decided that eight such orders against five countries will continue in effect. In July 2016, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission initiated a third review of the eight orders. The four orders covering imports of stainless steel plate in coils from three countries were continued for an additional five years in December 2016. A determination concerning continuation of the four orders covering imports of stainless steel sheet and strip in coils from three countries is expected in the third quarter of 2017.
Additionally, in February 2016, ATI and the three domestic stainless steel competitors filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions concurrently with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S International Trade Commission, charging that unfairly traded imports of stainless steel sheet and strip from the People’s Republic of China are causing material injury to the domestic stainless steel industry. In February 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued its final determinations, calculating antidumping duties ranging from 64% and 77% percent and countervailing duties ranging from 76% and 191%. These duties are generally applied in combination. The U.S. International Trade Commission is scheduled to announce its final determination in early March 2017. The antidumping duties and subsidy margins are expected to act as a significant deterrent to the illegal dumping of Chinese government-subsidized imports of stainless steel sheet and strip into the U.S. market. We continue to monitor imports from foreign producers for appropriate action.
Raw Materials and Supplies
Substantially all raw materials and supplies required in the manufacture of our products are available from more than one supplier and the sources and availability of raw materials essential to our businesses are currently adequate. The principal raw materials we use in the production of our specialty materials are scrap (including iron-, nickel-, chromium-, titanium-, and molybdenum-bearing scrap), nickel, titanium sponge, zirconium sand and sponge, ferrochromium, ferrosilicon, molybdenum and molybdenum alloys, manganese and manganese alloys, cobalt, niobium, vanadium and other alloying materials.
Purchase prices of certain principal raw materials have been volatile. As a result, our operating results may be subject to significant fluctuation. We use raw materials surcharge and index mechanisms to offset the impact of changes in raw material costs; however, competitive factors in the marketplace may limit our ability to institute such mechanisms, and there can be a delay between the change in the price of raw materials and the impact of such mechanisms. For example, in 2016 we used 
 6

approximately 80 million pounds of nickel; therefore a hypothetical change of a $1.00 per pound increase in nickel prices would result in increased costs of approximately $80 million. We also used approximately 300 million pounds of ferrous scrap in the production of our flat-rolled products; a hypothetical change of a $0.01 per pound increase would result in increased costs of approximately $3 million. 
In August 2016, we announced the indefinite idling of our Rowley, UT titanium sponge production in the HPMC segment, which was completed in December 2016. Over the last several years, significant global capacity has been added to produce titanium sponge, which is a key raw material used to produce ATI’s titanium products. In addition, demand for industrial-grade titanium products from global markets continues to be weak. As a result of these factors, titanium sponge, including aerospace quality sponge, can now be purchased from qualified global producers under long-term supply agreements at prices lower than the production costs at ATI’s titanium sponge facility in Rowley, UT. ATI has entered into long-term cost competitive supply agreements with several producers of premium-grade and standard-grade titanium sponge. The lower cost titanium sponge purchased under these supply agreements will replace the titanium sponge produced at the Rowley facility. 
Other raw materials, such as nickel, cobalt, and ferrochromium, are available to us and our specialty materials industry competitors primarily from foreign sources. Some of these foreign sources are located in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions, which could disrupt supplies or affect the price of these materials.
We purchase our nickel requirements principally from producers in Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia, and the Dominican Republic. Zirconium raw materials are primarily purchased from the United States and China. Cobalt is purchased primarily from producers in Canada. More than 80% of the world’s reserves of ferrochromium are located in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Albania, and Kazakhstan. Niobium is purchased primarily from producers in Brazil. We also purchase titanium sponge from sources in Kazakhstan and Japan.
Export Sales and Foreign Operations
Direct international sales represented approximately 41% of our total annual sales in 2016, 42% of our total sales in 2015, and 38% of our total sales in 2014. These figures include direct export sales by our U.S.-based operations to customers in foreign countries, which accounted for approximately 31% of our total sales in 2016, 33% of our total sales in 2015, and 28% of our total sales in 2014. Our overseas sales, marketing and distribution efforts are aided by our international marketing and distribution offices, ATI Europe, ATI Europe Distribution, and ATI Asia, or by independent representatives at various locations throughout the world. We believe that at least 50% of ATI’s 2016 sales were driven by global markets when we consider exports of our customers. Direct sales by geographic area in 2016, and as a percentage of total sales, were as follows:

(In millions) | | 
United States | $ | 1,857.5 | | 59 | %
Europe | 639.7 | | 21 | % 
Asia | 418.9 | | 13 | % 
Canada | 97.6 | | 3 | % 
South America, Middle East and other | 120.9 | | 4 | % 
Total sales | $ | 3,134.6 | | 100 | %

Our HPMC segment has manufacturing capabilities for melting, remelting, forging and finishing nickel-based alloys and specialty alloys in the United Kingdom, and manufacturing capabilities for precision forging and machining in Poland, primarily serving the aerospace, construction and transportation markets. Within our FRP segment, our STAL joint venture in the People’s Republic of China produces Precision Rolled Strip products, which enables us to offer these products more effectively to markets in China and other Asian countries. Our Uniti LLC joint venture allows us to offer titanium products to industrial markets more effectively worldwide.
Backlog, Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our backlog of confirmed orders was approximately $1.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2015. We expect that approximately 85% of confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2016 will be filled during the year ending December 31, 2017. Backlog of confirmed orders of our HPMC segment was approximately $1.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2015. We expect that approximately 83% of the confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2016 for this segment will be filled during the year ending December 31, 2017. Backlog of confirmed orders of our FRP segment was approximately $0.1 billion at December 31, 2016 and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2015. We expect that all of the confirmed orders on hand at December 31, 2016 for this segment will be filled during the year ending December 31, 2017.
 7

Generally, our sales and operations are not seasonal. However, demand for our products is cyclical over longer periods because specialty materials customers operate in cyclical industries and are subject to changes in general economic conditions and other factors both external and internal to those industries.
Research, Development and Technical Services
We believe that our research and development capabilities give ATI an advantage in developing new products and manufacturing processes that contribute to the profitable growth potential of our businesses on a long-term basis. We conduct research and development at our various operating locations both for our own account and, on a limited basis, for customers on a contract basis. Research and development expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 included the following:

(In millions) | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Company-Funded: | | | | | 
High Performance Materials & Components | $ | 10.9 | | | $ | 10.0 | | $ | 12.9
Flat Rolled Products | 3.6 | | | 4.0 | | | 4.3 
Corporate | 0.2 | | | 0.2 | | | 0.2 
 | 14.7 | | | 14.2 | | | 17.4
Customer-Funded: | | | | | 
High Performance Materials & Components | 2.2 | | | 1.5 | | | 2.7 
Total Research and Development | $ | 16.9 | | | $ | 15.7 | | $ | 20.1

Our research, development and technical service activities are closely interrelated and are directed toward cost reduction and process improvement, process control, quality assurance and control, system development, the development of new manufacturing methods, the improvement of existing manufacturing methods, the improvement of existing products, and the development of new products.
We own hundreds of United States patents, many of which are also filed under the patent laws of other nations. Although these patents, as well as our numerous trademarks, technical information, license agreements, and other intellectual property, have been and are expected to be of value, we believe that the loss of any single such item or technically related group of such items would not materially affect the conduct of our business.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants, and disposal of wastes, and which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. We could incur substantial cleanup costs, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non-compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities. We are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of our current and former sites as well as third party sites.
We consider environmental compliance to be an integral part of our operations. We have a comprehensive environmental management and reporting program that focuses on compliance with applicable federal, state, regional and local environmental laws and regulations. Each operating company has an environmental management system that includes mechanisms for regularly evaluating environmental compliance and managing changes in business operations while assessing environmental impact.
Our Corporate Guidelines for Business Conduct and Ethics address compliance with environmental laws as well as employment and workplace safety laws, and also describe our commitment to equal opportunity and fair treatment of employees. We continued to focus on safety across ATI’s operations during 2016. Our 2016 OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate was 2.11 and our Lost Time Case Rate was 0.44, which we believe to be competitive with world-class performance for our industry.
Employees
We have approximately 8,500 full-time employees, of which approximately 15% are located outside the United States. Approximately 40% of our workforce is covered by various collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), predominantly with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied & Industrial Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC (USW). On March 4, 2016, ATI announced that it had reached a four-year labor agreement with the USW 
 8

covering USW-represented employees of its ATI Flat Rolled Products business unit and at two locations in the HPMC business segment. The Company has CBAs with approximately 800 full-time employees that expire in 2017.
