Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 We engage in the discovery and clinical development of innovative medicines for patients suffering from severe, rare diseases using our knowledge of Physiocrine biology, a newly discovered set of physiological pathways.  Through our research efforts, we believe that Physiocrines evolved over billions of years to promote homeostasis in complex organisms.  We have evidence to support that some of these proteins evolved to govern and orchestrate the mammalian immune system. We believe immune imbalance is underappreciated in many disease types and may ultimately be responsible for much of the pathophysiology associated with a number of important genetic and immunology based diseases. 
 By focusing on immune pathways in disease, we believe our therapeutic candidates have the potential to restore patients to a healthier state, achieve homeostatic balance and ultimately lead to improved clinical outcomes. To date, our discovery efforts have generated three immunology-based investigational innovative therapeutic programs in three different therapeutic areas:
  
• | Resolaris: We internally discovered and developed Resolaris, our first Physiocrine-based therapeutic candidate, based on a protein naturally secreted from muscle that acts on T-cells at the tissue level to promote healthier muscle. We believe this may translate into an innovative therapeutic for rare genetic myopathies with an immune component (e.g. T-cells in the patients’ muscle), including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Resolaris also represents an example of our first therapeutic modality - natural protein therapy – adding back a pathway that is insufficiently produced by the human body to counteract disease. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stalaris: Our scientists successfully engineered the first fusion protein with a Physiocrine, Stalaris, to provide designed properties to enhance the immuno-modulatory aspects of a Physiocrine in vivo. We plan to develop Stalaris as a potential therapeutic for patients with rare pulmonary diseases with an immune component, including interstitial lung disease. This fusion protein, which utilizes the Fc region of an antibody, also potentially represents a novel Fc-Physiocrine platform for future Physiocrine-based therapies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Project ORCA: Our third program, represents a third therapeutic modality distinct from Resolaris or Stalaris. It also diversifies our pipeline by addressing severe diseases in a therapeutic area that differs from those of our first two programs. We use code name “Project ORCA” for this preclinical research program. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe therapies that can harness the power of the immune system represent an important frontier of transformational medicines. All of our current programs focus on modulating the immune system in an effort to create better clinical outcomes for patients. Our preclinical work increases our confidence that certain Physiocrines can be used to modulate immune cell activity, especially activated T-cells. Based on our clinical results to date, we believe Resolaris has a favorable safety and tolerability profile with no observed signs of general immunosuppression, which could give Resolaris a competitive advantage over current immunosuppressive agents (e.g. steroids). We have also observed promising signals of clinical activity in patients treated with Resolaris in our clinical studies, including improved muscle strength in certain patients, which we find encouraging to our therapeutic hypothesis. 
 Discoveries of new physiological pathways have been responsible for profound advancements in the field of medicine resulting in better patient outcomes and disruptive advantages for the industry’s therapeutic development pipeline. Such discoveries include homeostatic pathways, which gave rise to agonists such as insulin and erythropoietin, as well as antagonists to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the complement pathways.  
 Our expansive Physiocrine patent estate provides us with potential product protection as we pioneer this new and important area of human biology. To protect our industry unique pipeline based on our proprietary new biology, we have built an intellectual property estate comprising over 175 issued patents or allowed patent applications that are owned or exclusively licensed by us, including over 300 potential Physiocrine-based protein compositions. We believe it is in the best interest of our stakeholders, including patients, caregivers, and our stockholders, to advance one or more of our three current programs based on Physiocrine biology with the expertise of or funding from appropriate strategic partners. 
 Strategy
 We aim to capitalize on Physiocrine biology to develop novel, first-in-class medicines with industry unique mechanisms to treat patients with severe, rare diseases where immunology is important to the disease process. Key elements of our strategy include the following:

• | Leverage our leadership position in new pathways in immunology based on Physiocrine biology. As we continue to research and identify programs based on our understanding of immunology and Physiocrine biology, we are unraveling the depth of this new biology in relation to T-cells and the molecular basis for orchestrating T-cells and other immune cell activity.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Build a diverse biologics platform in immunology. We continue to deepen our expertise in protein production and develop biologic programs in three therapeutic modalities: 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. | Physiocrine natural protein therapy, as exemplified by Resolaris;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Fc- Physiocrine fusion protein therapy, as exemplified by Stalaris; and
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | A third therapeutic modality, in preclinical development, as exemplified by Project ORCA.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilize our expertise in industry unique mechanisms and build our pipeline. With our therapeutically diverse pipeline, we can follow the science to create maximum value for the benefit of patients and may parlay different programs in business relationships to enable a diversity of commercialization channels, as well as potentially provide additional funding opportunities to partners outside of equity financings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand upon our knowledge and clinical experience with the Resokine pathway to address severe conditions characterized by immune imbalance. With Resolaris and Stalaris, we intend to target patients across diseases of different etiology with the commonality of immune imbalance at the level of the tissue. We believe that a protein therapeutic that promotes homeostasis without immunosuppression would have a unique and valuable competitive advantage across multiple disease settings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our exclusive worldwide commercial rights to our product candidates to form meaningful strategic partnerships to enhance our future development and commercial efforts. We aim to independently develop and commercialize our product candidates in areas that create value while balancing resource considerations. In parallel, we will pursue and evaluate, and may selectively form business relationships, to strategically accelerate and advance our programs through the expertise of or funding from the appropriate partners.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our intellectual property position in Physiocrine biology. We intend to leverage our leadership position in this field to broaden our intellectual property positions in both the programs we advance and programs in development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a world class organization oriented to patients and focused on rigorous scientific, clinical and industrial advancements. We continue to assemble a world class team with industry-recognized expertise in biology, medicine and the commercialization of innovative and important therapeutics. We intend to expand our relationships with key opinion leaders, patient advocacy groups and other business partners, and to solicit input from payors and others in the healthcare industry, to identify and develop our product opportunities and to design our development programs in order to maximize the availability of our product candidates to patients.

Harnessing the Power of Immunology with Physiocrine Biology 
 Overview 
 Physiocrines are proteins derived from the extracellular signaling regions or alternatively spliced variants of tRNA synthetases that modulate a range of cellular activities to maintain homeostasis. The term Physiocrines; physio for life and crine for specific activity, includes tRNA synthetase gene derived proteins which mediate nontranslational, extracellular functions. tRNA synthetases were once generally thought to only play a role in protein synthesis by catalyzing the aminoacylation of tRNAs to their respective amino acids. In 1999, Paul Schimmel, Ph.D. and colleagues discovered that a protein derived from one of the genes for tRNA synthetases could act as an extracellular modulator of angiogenesis. Since then, we and other researchers have verified that tRNA synthetase gene products may have a number of functional roles outside of protein synthesis mediated by extracellular signaling regions and multiple splice variants of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. Those functional roles include immune modulation.
 aTyr Pharma was founded based on the therapeutic potential of these extracellular regions of tRNA synthetases to restore health to tissues out of balance. 
 For over four billion years, the core function and structure of tRNA synthetases for protein synthesis remain primarily unchanged in most organisms. However, as organisms became more complex, changes in DNA sequences appeared in tRNA synthetase genes.  These DNA mutations resulted in additional protein domains that are predicted to have important functions outside of protein synthesis. When released, we reason Physiocrines exert homeostatic and developmental control in many cell types, tissues, and organs and have been shown to play a role in regulation of glucose metabolism, organogenesis, angiogenesis, inflammation, cell death, stress responses that may lead to tumorigenesis, modulation of the immune response, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling, as well as interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and p53 signalling. 
 The Promise of Physiocrine-Based Medicines in Promoting Homeostasis
 Homeostasis, or the coordinated regulation of tissues within the body, enables overall health and survival of an organism.  For the complicated lives of multicellular organisms that have multiple organ systems, homeostasis represents a primal set of processes to enable life and combat damage and disease. Disruption of homeostasis can lead to disease and death. The concept of homeostasis was first described in 1865 by the French physiologist Claude Bernard, and Walter Cannon later coined the term. In the 150 years since this discovery, many proteins associated with homeostatic pathways have been discovered, ranging from insulin to erythropoietin.
 5

Using our knowledge of bioinformatics, sequencing, proteomics and structural biology, we identified Physiocrines, a novel class of proteins that are present as biologically active signaling proteins derived from tRNA synthetase genes, an ancient gene family. We believe that Physiocrines are involved in orchestrating homeostatic activities to help the body restore diseased or damaged tissue to a healthier state. We observed that certain Physiocrines exhibit previously undescribed extracellular activities that are involved in restoring and regulating tissues to promote health. We believe that physiological perturbations, such as stress or changes in physiological state, alter or induce the release of Physiocrines from cells or platelets in the human body. 
 We expressed and purified over 200 Physiocrine regions across the family of 20 tRNA synthetase genes and evaluated these purified Physiocrines in numerous cell-based assays to determine their activity in several important human physiological pathways. Some of the data were published in July 2014 in Science, with the data categorized according to important areas of biology. This research revealed that there are approximately 100 Physiocrines with demonstrated activity in various cell-based assays related to immunological pathways. The specific regulatory capability of Physiocrines makes this class of proteins potential candidates for multiple therapeutic applications including rare diseases with an immune component, auto-immune disorders, neuro-degeneration, fibrosis and oncology.
 Understanding and Harnessing Immunology Systems with Physiocrine Biology
 We focus on understanding immunological pathways, using our knowledge of Physiocrine biology, to develop therapies for severe disease where we can achieve a transformative impact on a patient’s life. We selected immunology as our initial area of focus for the following reasons:

• | We believe immunology plays a significant role in most diseases, including rare genetic diseases;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A number of Physiocrines have been shown to be differentially expressed by cells important for immune function;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A large number of Physiocrine pathways appear to relate to immunology;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Approximately 100 Physiocrines have demonstrated activity in various cell-based assays related to immunological pathways; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential therapeutic applications include rare diseases with an immune component, auto-immune disorders, neuro-degeneration, fibrosis and oncology.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We focus on modulators of immune processes for indications that represent severe, rare diseases, particularly genetically based diseases, because:
  
• | Our scientific understanding of Physiocrines as potential immuno-modulators that intersected with multiple rare diseases;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Patients with rare genetic diseases often face challenges related to the responses of their immune system to changes in tissues that are caused by their genetic mutations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pathological immuno-phenotypes in rare diseases present an opportunity for us to therapeutically intervene with greater impact.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Advantages of Physiocrine-Based Therapeutics
 We believe that Physiocrines modulate the immune system and control or reduce tissue damage while maintaining the immune system’s activity against exogenous pathogen based insults, and may possess the following advantages over most current immunological based drugs:
  
• | As proteins designed by nature to control the immune system, Physiocrines may provide a unique mechanism to improve patient outcomes through their activity in either a single pathway or multiple pathways;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Physiocrines possess the potential to control the immune system across multiple pathways at the level of an immune cell, rather than lowering the levels of a single immune protein;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Physiocrines may potentially act as agonists at the level of the immune cell to reduce pro-inflammatory effects and induce resolution of inappropriate immune activity or inflammation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The therapeutic effects of Physiocrines may persist even after the Physiocrines have been cleared from circulation; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Resolaris, our first Physiocrine-based therapeutic candidate, has not demonstrated signs of general immunosuppression in the clinic, which represents a potential competitive advantage as compared to other immune agents that are often broadly immunosuppressive.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Resokine Pathway – Modulating the Immune System
 Overview of the Resokine Pathway
 Our scientists were the first to discover the Resokine pathway (reso for restoring tissue health and kine for activity related to cytokines), an extracellular pathway involving human skeletal muscle tissue and arising from the activity of various regions of the protein histidine aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (HARS) encoded by its gene. We believe the Resokine pathway (i) is a homeostatic pathway that controls the set point of T-cells in the immune system to ensure appropriate control of immune responses, and (ii) may play an important role in muscle and lung health. We believe the Resokine pathway is characterized by:

• | A series of Physiocrine proteins arising from a single gene, HARS;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Balancing of the immune responses to promote homeostasis; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disruptions or insufficiencies in the Resokine pathway in relation to disease perturbations at the level of the tissue lead to inappropriate immune responses contributing to disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identification of the Resokine Pathway through In Vivo Screening Approaches
 Our scientists discovered the Resokine pathway in human skeletal muscle using our in vivo screening systems in models of severe inflammation, combined with our knowledge of the effects of antibody binding to a specific tRNA synthetase in a population of patients with a particular rare myopathy and interstitial lung disease (ILD). The Resokine pathway encompasses physiological activities, including potential immuno-modulatory and other muscle health activities, arising from various Physiocrine regions of HARS.  Animal studies and human pathophysiological data have shown that antibody-based blockade of the Resokine pathway may lead to muscle tissue deterioration and immune cell invasion.
 First Demonstration of a Splice Variant of HARS as an Immuno-modulator 
 We conducted in vivo screening activities of a splice variant from HARS, which we refer to as the immuno-modulatory domain or iMod domain, that we identified in our deep sequencing studies. For our studies of the iMod domain, we selected a rodent model of severe immune cell activity or inflammation induced by the administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, or TNBS, in which the inflammation is thought to be driven by excessive T-cell involvement in the gut, leading to the death of the study animals. Animals administered the iMod domain survived longer than those given either the vehicle control phosphate buffer solution, or PBS, or an approved drug control (Budesonide) (p<0.01), demonstrating the potential activity of the iMod domain as an immuno-modulator of excessive T-cell involvement.
 Mechanism of Action
 The Resokine pathway includes interactions with activated T-cells. Our scientists continue to elucidate the role of the Resokine pathway in affecting the level of activation of T-cells stimulated by CD3 and CD28. Our first two product candidates, Resolaris and Stalaris, harness the Resokine pathway and interact with T-cells to ‘place a brake’ on T-cell activation.
 In vitro T-cell modulation experiments have demonstrated that at 100 pM Resolaris results in significant reduction of T-cell activation as shown by reduced expression of T-cell activation markers. Resolaris appears to work on activated T-cells by conferring characteristics closer to that of resting T-cells.

 Evidence of the Role of the Resokine Pathway in Rare Muscle and Lung Diseases
 In 1983, Matthews and Bernstein published in Nature the observation that patients with a rare myopathy possessed antibodies to a single tRNA synthetase, HARS. Since then, it has been observed that patients with auto-antibodies to HARS (but not antibodies to the other 19 tRNA synthetases in the same patients) can develop both a debilitating myopathy characterized by weakness and skeletal muscle loss, as well ILD, both of which are characterized by T-cell invasion into diseased tissues. Numerous research laboratories have verified the existence of human anti-HARS antibodies, also known as Jo-1 antibodies, as one of the manifestations of the auto-immune disease, anti-synthetase syndrome.
 Based on these observations, we chose to study the potential link between HARS antibodies and muscle disease in anti-synthetase syndrome patients with Jo-1 antibodies. Our scientists obtained serum samples from 18 of these patients to determine whether the Jo-1 antibodies specifically bound to the iMod domain. We determined that in each of the 18 Jo-1 antibody positive patients studied, a significant portion of Jo-1 antibody binding was to the iMod domain, compared to binding to other regions of HARS. We believe that in these patients, the binding of Jo-1 antibodies to the iMod domain blocked the immuno-modulatory properties of the iMod domain, therefore contributing to their myopathy and ILD. Independent laboratories have also observed in unrelated studies that the iMod domain is the primary antibody binding region in Jo-1 antibody patients with anti-synthetase syndrome.

Product Development Programs 
 Our Industry Unique Pipeline—A New Set of Potential Treatment Mechanisms for Patients
 We believe that, as the first and only company engaged in the clinical development of therapeutics based on Physiocrine biology, we are positioned to develop and commercialize a pipeline based on a novel class of protein therapeutics that modulate important physiological processes. These agents are protected by intellectual property rights that we own or exclusively license.  Below are summaries of our product development pipeline:

Programs | Development Status | Therapeutic Area 
-----------------+----------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------
Resolaris | Phase 1b/2 | Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) 
Phase 1b/2 | Early Onset Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy
Phase 1b/2 | Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) 
Under Evaluation | Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) 
Stalaris | Phase 1 in 2H 2017 | Interstitial Lung Disease with an Immune Component
Project ORCA | Preclinical | 3rd Therapeutic Area 

Resolaris – Natural Protein Therapy Candidate
 Overview
 We created Resolaris to serve as a potentially first-in-class intravenous protein therapeutic for the treatment of rare myopathies with an immune component. We derived Resolaris from a naturally occurring protein, HARS, which we believe possesses the potential to reset the immune system in diseased tissue to a more normal state without general immunosuppression. Resolaris is released in vitro by human skeletal muscle cells. Resolaris may provide therapeutic benefit to patients in rare myopathy indications characterized by excessive immune cell involvement, particularly a type of T-cell known as CD8-T-cells, and macrophages. Immune cell invasion can cause and exacerbate muscle damage and stress. For example, CD8-T-cells have been observed to contribute to muscle damage by the release of proteins that destroy or damage skeletal muscle cells.  
Resolaris
 Wild-type human histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HARS) slightly truncated
 To date, we have focused our clinical development of Resolaris on two broad types of rare genetic myopathies: FSHD and LGMD. DMD is another example of a rare myopathy with an immune component which might warrant clinical investigation.  These particular myopathies represent several distinct, genetic sub-type indications that we believe Resolaris has the potential to treat. In each of these indications, skeletal muscle tissue exhibits dysfunction and becomes subject to immune cell invasion, which contributes to loss of function and deterioration of muscle tissue. These patients generally present with three common characteristics:

• | expression of aberrant protein (in case of genetically based rare myopathies);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | immune cell invasion; and
--+--------------------------


• | muscle cell damage and deterioration.
--+--------------------------------------

The Role of Immuno-Modulation in Rare Genetic Myopathies with an Immune Component
 In normal muscle, muscle mass and function require a balance between muscle cell stress and damage and muscle cell regeneration and growth. The immune system helps maintain this balance by “cleaning up” damaged muscle cells after muscle damage and during the healing process. In rare myopathies, the balance is tipped to favor chronic pathophysiological muscle deterioration and persistent immune cell invasion. In genetically based rare myopathies, aberrant protein expression often occurs, as in the case of FSHD, LGMD, and DMD patients. In vivo rodent models of skeletal muscle deterioration and immune cell invasion have shown that Resolaris can combat both immune cell invasion into the muscle as well as muscle deterioration. 
 We intend to harness the body’s power to restore skeletal muscle after stress or damage in the development of Resolaris for rare myopathy patients who have limited or no approved treatment options. Resolaris may offer a potential multi-pharmacologic therapeutic, synergistically modulating multiple pathways important to muscle health. 
 About Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD)
 LGMD refers to a group of rare genetic myopathies, of which there are more than 20 different subtypes, none with approved therapies. These myopathies are uniformly progressive and characterized predominantly by proximal weakness affecting the pelvic and shoulder girdles and usually sparing the face. 
 LGMD2B, a recessively inherited LGMD, is often termed dysferlinopathy, given that the causative mutations reside within the dysferlin gene. Patients experience progressive debilitating muscle weakness and atrophy as well as immune cell invasion in the skeletal muscle. There are multiple lines of evidence supporting a prominent role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of LGMD2B. Patients with LGMD2B possess a dysregulated immune response, including immune cell infiltration into affected muscle, increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and altered cellular responses.
 Based on a prevalence rate of 1:20,000, we estimate that LGMD affects an estimated 16,000 patients in the U.S., approximately 3,000 of whom have LGMD2B. 
 The FDA granted Resolaris (ATYR1940) fast track designation for the treatment of LGMD2B and orphan drug designation for the treatment of LGMD.  The European Commission also granted orphan medicinal product designation for Resolaris (ATYR1940) for the treatment of LGMD.
 About Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD)
 FSHD is a rare genetic myopathy affecting an estimated 19,000 people in the United States for which there are no approved treatments. It is caused by a toxic gain of function in the DUX4 gene. The primary clinical phenotype of FSHD is debilitating skeletal muscle deterioration and weakness. The symptoms of FSHD often appear early in the face, shoulder blades, upper arms, lower legs and trunk, and can affect certain muscles while adjacent muscles remain healthy. In addition to muscle weakness, FSHD patients often experience debilitating fatigue and chronic pain. The disease is typically diagnosed by the presence of a characteristic pattern of muscle weakness and other clinical symptoms, as well as through genetic testing.
 While FSHD can manifest at any age, the onset of symptoms in many patients occurs before the age of 18.  We refer to this patient population as early onset FSHD.  Within the early onset population are individuals with symptom onset at less than five years of age, with progression in disease prior to age ten. These individuals have generally the most severe muscle symptoms and extra-muscular manifestations such as auditory deficits and retinal complications that may result in vision loss.  This sub-group of early onset patients are often referred to as having “infantile onset” FSHD. Estimates of prevalence vary; however, we believe the “infantile onset” FSHD population is approximately 1,000 in the U.S.  
 The FDA granted Resolaris (ATYR1940) fast track designation and orphan drug designation for the treatment of FSHD. The European Commission granted orphan medicinal product designation for Resolaris (ATYR1940) for the treatment of FSHD.
 About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)
 DMD is the most common fatal genetic disorder diagnosed in childhood, affecting approximately 1 in every 3,500 live male births (about 20,000 new cases each year worldwide). Because the Duchenne gene is found on the X-chromosome, it primarily affects boys across all races and cultures. DMD results in progressive loss of strength and is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for dystrophin. Because dystrophin is absent the muscle cells are easily damaged. The progressive muscle weakness leads to serious medical problems particularly issues related to the heart and lungs. Young men with DMD typically live into their late twenties. Although there are medical treatments that may help slow its progression, there is currently no cure for DMD in any of the over 50 genetic forms.
 Recently, the FDA approved deflazacort, a steroid which acts as an immunosuppressive, for the treatment of DMD. DMD patients are characterized by immune dysregulation including increases in CD8 T-cell infiltration, macrophage infiltration, matrix metallopeptidase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. However, deflazacort also has negative effects on muscle cell biology. We believe a treatment that can modulate the immune system without causing immunosuppression and negative effects on muscle cell biology could potentially provide a benefit to these patients above and beyond standard of care. 
 10

We are currently evaluating DMD as a potential RMIC indication for future investigation with Resolaris.
 Clinical Development 
 The following table summarizes our clinical trials to date:
  
Study ID / Status | Study Population | Number of Subjects | Phase | Study Design | Dosing Regimen | Dosing Duration 
-------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
ATYR1940-C-001 (“001 Study”) Completed | Healthy Subjects | 32 | 1 | Placebo Controlled, Randomized (3:1), Single Ascending Dose Safety Study | Single dose of 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg | Single dose with six subjects in each of the four dose cohorts
ATYR1940-C-002 (“002 Study”) Completed | Adult FSHD | 20 | 1b/2 | Placebo Controlled, Randomized (3:1), Multiple Ascending Dose Safety Study | Weekly doses of 0.3 mg/kg (Cohort 1) Weekly doses of 1.0 mg/kg (Cohort 2) Weekly doses of 3.0 mg/kg (Cohort 3) | 4 weeks (Cohorts 1 & 2) 12 weeks (Cohort 3) 
ATYR1940-C-003 (“003 Study”) Enrollment closed | Early Onset FSHD | 8 | 1b/2 | Open-Label, Intra-Patient Dose Escalation Study | Weekly doses starting at 0.3 mg/kg with potential dose escalation up to 3.0 mg/kg | 12 weeks Trial concluding in the first half of 2017 
ATYR1940-C-004 (“004 Study”) Completed | LGMD2B and FSHD | 18 | 1b/2 | Open-Label, Intra-Patient Dose Escalation Study | Weekly and twice weekly doses starting at 0.3 mg/kg with potential dose escalation up to 1.0 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg | 12 weeks 
ATYR1940-C-005 (“005 Study”) Enrollment closed | Adult FSHD from 002 Study | 9 | 1b/2 | Open-Label Safety Extension Study | Weekly doses of 3.0 mg/kg | Trial concluding in the first half of 2017 
ATYR1940-C-006 (“006 Study”) Enrollment closed | Adult LGMD2B, Adult FSHD, Early Onset FSHD from 003 & 004 Studies | 8 | 1b/2 | Open-Label Safety Extension Study | Weekly doses of 3.0 mg/kg | Trial concluding in the first half of 2017 

 The planning and design of our exploratory Phase 1b/2 trials were guided by principles related to safety and tolerability.  In particular, the trials were designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of Resolaris in patients with adult FSHD, adult LGMD2B or early onset FSHD (as set forth in the table above).  In addition, the studies also evaluated certain clinical assessments and the utility of exploratory pharmacodynamic (PD) markers (including MRI measurements to quantitate areas of potential muscle inflammation).  The studies were not powered to demonstrate statistically significant evidence of therapeutic utility or a specific activity endpoint.  
 As part of clinical assessments in these studies, manual muscle testing (MMT), a validated assessment tool that measures muscle strength, was performed across 14 selected muscle groups at different time points in the study. Muscles are scored individually and a composite score is calculated. Progression of disease leads to lower scores and a negative change from baseline. Conversely, improvement in muscle function is indicated by higher scores and a positive change from baseline. In addition, a validated patient reported outcome measure designed specifically for neuromuscular disease, the individualized neuromuscular quality of life (INQoL) questionnaire, was utilized. FSHD and LGMD2B are progressive muscle diseases and we expect that an increase in disease burden would be reflected in decreased MMT and increased INQoL measurements over time.  
 11

Adult Patients with LGMD2B
 Composite MMT scores increased over the course of the three month 004 Study for 78% of the LGMD2B patients (seven of nine). One patient could not complete the full MMT assessments at baseline and therefore the patient’s scores were not recorded. Overall, the LGMD2B patients had a mean increase of MMT scores from baseline of 6.2%.  Overall INQoL scores were relatively stable with approximately equal proportions of patients with decreases in disease burden compared to increases in disease burden.
Percentage Change From Baseline to Week 14 in Manual Muscle Test Composite Score by Patient (n=9*): 

Patients with Early Onset FSHD
 We are conducting an international, multi-center, open-label, intra-patient, placebo run-in, dose escalation Phase 1b/2 clinical trial (003 Study) designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and exploratory assessments of clinical activity of Resolaris at weekly doses of 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg in patients with early onset FSHD for a total of 12 weeks.
 We have completed the first stage of this trial and expect to announce top-line results and conclude the trial in the second quarter of 2017. 
 An interim data review was conducted for the first four early-onset FSHD patients that completed treatment with Resolaris (age range of 16 to 20). Patient’s INQoL scores were relatively stable with two patients demonstrating slight decreases in disease burden and one patient with an increase. The fourth patient did not have a baseline INQoL assessment and was excluded from the analysis. Muscle strength, as noted by MMT scores, increased over the course of the three month trial for 75% of the early onset patients (three of four). Overall, the early onset FSHD patients had a mean increase of MMT scores from baseline of 6.7%. 
 Adult Patients with FSHD
 We have conducted four trials which included adult FSHD patients, including our 002 Study, an international Phase 1b/2 placebo-controlled clinical trial; our 004 Study, an international Phase 1b/2 open-label, intra-patient, placebo run-in, dose escalation clinical trial, our 005 Study, a long-term safety extension clinical trial with patients rolling over from our 002 Study, and our 006 Study, a long-term safety extension clinical trial with patients rolling over from our 004 Study. 
 We announced data during 2016 from three separate clinical trials treating adult FSHD patients with Resolaris: our 002 Study, 004 Study and our 005 Study. While these were distinct trials under separate protocols and were not designed for comparability, based on data previously disclosed, an increase in MMT scores was observed in approximately 50% of patients across these three separate studies. In the placebo-controlled 002 trial, a trend in improvement in MMT scores for patients treated with Resolaris was observed compared with placebo patients, with a concentration of improved MMT scores in the upper limbs. For the eight FSHD patients in the 004 Study, the overall MMT scores were relatively stable with four of the eight patients presenting with a slight increase in their muscle strength. 
 In addition, disease burden, as measured by the INQoL assessment, was lower in a majority of FSHD patients treated with Resolaris across our three separate studies. Patients treated with Resolaris showed an improvement, as assessed by INQoL, compared with placebo, and we observed the greatest improvement in patients in Cohort 3 (3.0 mg/kg for 12 weeks) of the 002 Study, a placebo-controlled trial. Patients in Cohort 3 reported approximately 9.9% improvement in INQoL compared with approximately 15.6% worsening in the placebo group at week 14. Five out of the six patients dosed with Resolaris in Cohort 3 showed overall improvement in their INQoL score at week 14, versus zero out of two patients on placebo.

Biomarkers
 A number of exploratory PD markers and clinical assessments were conducted to better understand their utility in FSHD and LGMD2B.  Various exploratory biomarkers (including targeted muscle T2 and STIR MRI and various plasma proteins) did not generally establish sufficiently high or consistent levels or robust signals across a sufficient number of patients to determine test article effects. Peripheral cell based biomarkers will be assessed in the future using one or more mechanistic assays currently under development for agonists of the Resokine pathway and T-cell activity. Future trials will be designed using one or more of these mechanistic assays, as well as the option to assess local immune components in skeletal muscle directly with biopsies. Targeted muscle T2/STIR MRI will not be prioritized as a biomarker in the near-term.
 Long-Term Safety Extension Studies in Patients with Adult FSHD, Adult LGMD2B, and Early Onset FSHD (005 and 006 Studies)
 These ongoing international, multi-center, open-label extension clinical trials are designed to assess the long-term safety, effects on biomarkers and systemic exposure of Resolaris in patients with adult FSHD, adult LGMD2B, and early onset FSHD from our 002, 003 and 004 Studies. Patients receive weekly doses of 3.0 mg/kg on an ongoing basis. We provided an update from the 005 Study in December 2016 and plan to provide an update from the 006 Study in the middle of 2017. We are currently in the process of concluding both of these studies as we believe the studies have met their objectives to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of Resolaris in patients from our 002, 003 and 004 Studies.
 Safety and Tolerability Profile
 Our early clinical development plan for Resolaris evaluated three rare genetic myopathies: adult FSHD, early onset FSHD, and LGMD2B where there is no therapeutic standard of care. This allowed us to collect important information related to the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of our first Physiocrine in the clinic. Establishing a safety dossier in our Phase 1b/2 trials in treatment naïve patients was an important developmental milestone for us to achieve before evaluating whether to broaden our indication potential for Resolaris.
 As of December 31, 2016, 44 patients and 24 healthy volunteers have received Resolaris across all trials for a total drug exposure of 191 months. In those trials, Resolaris was well tolerated in all doses tested, across various age groups, and with long-term exposure. No serious adverse events were reported by the study investigators. A low incidence of adverse events were reported in these trials and all adverse events were mild-to-moderate in intensity. There were no observed signs of general immunosuppressive effects which is consistent with a homeostatic pathway working at the tissue level.
 A low level of anti-drug antibody assay signals were observed in these trials. These signals did not reach levels to trigger a neutralizing assay and did not result in clinical symptoms.
 Protocol discontinuations in these studies were primarily driven by mild-to-moderate transient infusion related reactions and elevations in a sponsor defined Jo-1 antibody level threshold. Discontinuation criteria in these trials related to infusion rate reactions and elevations in Jo-1 antibodies were implemented with a conservative approach as we gained understanding of this first Physiocrine in the clinic. 
 Stalaris – First Engineered Fusion Protein of a Physiocrine 
 Overview
To leverage our knowledge of the Resokine pathway, our scientists established a discovery program conducting a series of protein engineering experiments in vivo to enhance the activity of the iMod domain. The goal of the program was to develop a potential therapeutic that would retain only the N-terminal immuno-modulatory and fibro-modulatory activities of Resokine while enabling enhanced activity in vivo using a different dosing regime.  Fc fusion proteins have been successfully commercialized previously by others to enhance exposure of a naturally occurring protein while enabling biological activity. We explored this approach by fusing the immunoglobulin Fc with one iMod domain, which can form a dimer. Enbrel, Orencia and Zaltrap are commercialized examples of immunoglobulin Fc fusion proteins.
 13

Fc Fusion Platform
 Our Fc fusion experiments have delineated how to enhance the exposure of the iMod domain of Resokine while maintaining activity and have provided insights into the immuno-modulatory activity of the iMod domain. Initial experiments have indicated that Fc fusion proteins can increase exposure and maintain iMod domain activity.  Our efforts in this research program have led to the selection of our second product candidate, Stalaris. This fusion protein potentially represents a novel Fc-Physiocrine platform for future Physiocrine-based therapies.
 Currently we are producing our Stalaris molecules in E.coli by expression in inclusion bodies and refolding to recreate the native structure. This is in contrast to some other marketed Fc fusion therapeutics that are manufactured in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, although the FDA-approved commercial product Romiplostim (NPlate) is also expressed in E.coli and refolded. We are working with a third party manufacturer on the development and GMP manufacturing process for the production of Stalaris preclinical and clinical drug substance. 
 Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) and the Role of Immunology
 The Resokine pathway may play an important role in maintaining lung health. We believe the Resokine pathway plays a role in the regulation of tissue homeostasis with respect to immune cell invasion and residence, including in lung tissue. Jo-1 antibody patients often develop ILD, a pathophysiologic state that involves inflammation and fibrosis of the alveoli, distal airways and septal interstitium of the lungs, includes various patterns of lung pathology and is associated with markedly impaired lung function. We have observed that Jo-1 antibodies isolated from these patients bind to the iMod domain that we believe harbors immuno-modulatory activity.
 ILD develops in approximately 85% of anti-synthetase patients with Jo-1 antibodies to Resokine. It can include the presence of focal immune cell infiltrates and an acinar pattern of involvement on chest computed tomography (CT) scan, lymphocytic predominance on broncho-alveolar lavage and lymphocytic invasion of alveolar and interstitial lung tissues on biopsy, and can advance to fibrosis. The pathological patterns in Jo-1 antibody ILD include cellular and fibrotic forms of non-specific interstitial pneumonitis, usual interstitial pneumonitis and diffuse alveolar damage. The development of ILD in Jo-1 antibody patients, particularly the acute severe forms of the disease, portends high morbidity and mortality. Elevations in a number of circulating immune proteins are observed in Jo-1 antibody associated ILD including interferon (IFN)-inducible chemokines CXCL9, or MIG, and CXCL10 or IP-10, IL-8 and IL-6.
 ILD occurs in other settings such as rare genetic disorders, environmental exposures, as a side effect of certain therapeutics and as a manifestation of certain connective tissue disorders. Among these forms of ILD, we have identified several that result in severe and progressive lung disease and share immune-pathophysiology features that have the potential to be impacted by our demonstrated Stalaris activities. Examples of rare pulmonary diseases with an immune component include idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonias, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, bleomycin (the chemotherapeutic agent)-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and ILD in the setting of systemic sclerosis, or scleroderma, and sarcoidosis. 
 Preclinical Development 
 To test our hypothesis that augmenting the Resokine pathway with Stalaris has therapeutic potential in ILD, we have generated data in a mouse model of lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Stalaris has also shown promising therapeutic activity in this bleomycin-induced model (as set forth in the table below) which has been used previously in the development of therapeutics for different forms of ILD, including the drug pirfenidone, or Esbriet, which was approved by the FDA in October 2014 for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We noted that Stalaris administration attenuated the radiographic and histological manifestations of pathophysiology in this model when it was dosed therapeutically. These mouse Stalaris pharmacology data, along with data discussed above delineating our immuno-modulatory activity in other settings, provide preclinical evidence supporting our hypothesis that augmenting the Resokine pathway has therapeutic potential in ILD.

Bleomycin Rodent Model for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):  

Project ORCA - Third Biologics Program

 Based on our knowledge of Physiocrine biology, we have established a third biologics program from our research efforts, code name “Project ORCA,” currently in preclinical development. Project ORCA represents a third therapeutic modality distinct from Resolaris or Stalaris.  
Our Discovery Engine for Therapeutic Applications of Physiocrines in Immunology
 We plan to leverage our discovery engine to identify other Physiocrine pathways of interest and select additional potential product candidates for preclinical and clinical investigation in a variety of disease settings. The engine that drives our discovery efforts is based on our scientific investigation of Physiocrine pathways and their proteins, coupled with a process of identifying disease indications that may benefit from a Physiocrine therapeutic. Through a combination of deep sequencing and bioinformatics panning, augmented by proteomic analysis, we have identified over 300 naturally occurring Physiocrines. We then expressed and purified over 200 of these Physiocrines. Our strategy for identifying function and potential indications begins with developing a series of phenotypic assays for in vitro and in vivo evaluations of function. 
 A key step in the discovery engine requires mining data from rare disease patients and linking this to the data generated in our phenotypic profiling experiments either in vitro or in vivo models of immunology. We believe our strategy of understanding Physiocrine function by using in vivo experiments early and often while using patient data to focus this in vivo exploration has been validated by our Resolaris, Stalaris and Project ORCA programs. Additionally, we believe our discovery engine can be applied to other members of the Physiocrine family to help identify additional indications that may benefit from therapeutic intervention with Physiocrines.
 We believe the biology of Physiocrines presents a novel protein therapeutic development opportunity based on the modulation of important immunological pathways applicable to multiple diseases. This “pathway” approach or “physiology first” paradigm as we call it, which leverages the understanding of a basic physiological process, has been used successfully to create some of the most important therapeutics in such diverse areas as oncology and ophthalmology. Given the breadth of our discoveries, we currently focus on Physiocrine pathways related to immune and regeneration responses to explore for product candidates with rare disease applications.

Competition 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. We will face competition with respect to Resolaris and Stalaris and any other protein therapeutics we may develop or commercialize in the future from pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we may develop.
 Although we believe we are the only company engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutics based on Physiocrine pathways, we are aware of other companies that are developing products that could compete as treatments for our targeted indications, as described below.
 In the area of rare myopathies with an immune component, we expect to face competition from a number of companies, academic institutions and other organizations, including Sarepta Therapeutics, PTC Therapeutics, Inc., Marathon Pharmaceuticals, Santhera Pharmaceuticals, Italfarmaco S.p.A, Summit Therapeutics, Catabasis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., FibroGen, Inc., F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Bristol Myers Squibb, Milo Biotechnology, LLC, Nobelpharma Co. Ltd., Pfizer, Inc., and Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals, that are engaged in the clinical development of therapeutics to address muscle loss and muscle weakness in a variety of indications. More specifically, in the area of LGMD, we are aware of a number of academic institutions engaged in the clinical development of therapeutics, including Genethon, a not-for-profit research laboratory created by the Association Française contre les Myopathies, or French Muscular Dystrophy Association, which has completed an experimental Phase 1 clinical trial in LGMD2C using gene therapy; Nationwide Children’s Hospital, which is currently conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of an AAV vector to transport the alpha-sarcoglycan gene into muscles in LGMD2D; and NeuroGen Brain and Spine Institute in India, which is currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in an unspecified form of LGMD using stem cell therapy. In addition, Pfizer currently has a program Domagrozumab (PF-06252616) which is in Phase 1b/2 clinical trials for the treatment of LGMD2I as well as a Phase 2 program for DMD. In the area of FSHD, while there are currently no approved products for this disease, Acceleron Pharma Inc. is developing a clinical candidate, ACE-083, a locally acting protein therapeutic designed to increase muscle mass and strength in patients with neuromuscular disorders and other diseases characterized by a loss of muscle function, including FSHD in which it initiated a Phase 2 trial in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, Facio Therapies recently announced its plans to screen chemical libraries to identify chemical compounds that will boost the expression of proteins known to repress one of the causal genes responsible for FSHD. In the area of DMD, two therapies have been approved in the last 12 months: Exondys 51 from Sarepta and Emflaza from Marathon Pharmaceuticals. Marathon Pharmaceuticals and PTC Therapeutics, Inc. recently announced entering an asset purchase agreement whereby PTC Therapeutics, Inc. will acquire all rights to Emflaza. Exondys 51 is an antisense oligonucleotide indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. The approval is under accelerated approval based on an increase in dystrophin in skeletal muscle observed in some patients, but no clinical benefit has been established. Emflaza is a corticosteroid (deflazacort) indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients 5 years of age or older. 
 In the area of rare lung diseases with an immune component, notably ILD, we expect to face competition from pirfenidone, which is marketed by F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Shionogi Ltd. and Il Dong Pharmaceutical globally, as well as nintedanib, a small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitor marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim, both of which were approved by the FDA in October 2014. We are also aware of a number of companies engaged in the clinical development of therapeutics for lung diseases, including Astra Zeneca plc., Biogen Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, FibroGen, Inc., Asahi Kasei, Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A, Chugai, Promedior, Inc., Pliant Therapeutics, Inc. and Sanofi S.A.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We intend, where strategically appropriate, to build the commercial infrastructure in the United States and Europe necessary to effectively support the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of the first of such product candidates in a particular geographic market appears imminent. We may elect to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our products in selected geographic locations or for particular indications. 
 The commercial infrastructure for products directed at rare disease indications typically consists of a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by sales management, medical liaisons, internal sales support, an internal marketing group, and distribution support. One challenge unique to commercializing therapies for rare diseases is the difficulty in identifying eligible patients due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous disease populations. 
 Additional capabilities important to the marketing of therapeutics for rare diseases include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved.
 16

Manufacturing
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing and testing of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing or testing facilities for the clinical or commercial production of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, and contract research organizations, or CROS, is cost-efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional resources early in development. Although we rely on CDMOs and CROs, we have personnel with extensive biologics development and manufacturing experience to oversee such CDMOs and CROs.
 To date, our CDMOs and CROs have met our manufacturing requirements for clinical development and we expect that our current CDMOs and CROs are capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet our anticipated clinical development needs. 
 Resolaris
 Resolaris is expressed in recombinant bacteria, purified, formulated, filled and packaged for clinical use. For our Phase 1b/2 clinical trials conducted to date, the drug substance for Resolaris was manufactured in India by Syngene International Limited, or Syngene. We have a non-exclusive license to the host-cell line used to produce drug substance for Resolaris at Syngene. Resolaris drug product for such Phase 1b/2 clinical trials was manufactured by CDMOs in India and the United States.
 To meet our projected needs for future clinical trials and larger scale commercial manufacturing, we are working with Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies USA, Inc., or Fujifilm, and have completed the development, scale-up and GMP manufacturing process for the production of Resolaris drug substance. We have also successfully demonstrated comparability of the product manufactured at the different scales and sites. The host-cell line used to produce the drug substance for Resolaris at Fujifilm is in Fujifilm’s control.  We have an option to obtain a non-exclusive license for such host-cell line if we move production to another CDMO. The drug product process for Resolaris was also successfully scaled and transferred to a CDMO in Germany. 
 We contract with CROs to conduct labeling, as well as for the storage and distribution of Resolaris to clinical sites. Additionally, we have negotiated with additional storage and labelling CROs to enable the commercial storage and supply of Resolaris. 
 Stalaris
 Our second clinical candidate, Stalaris, is a Fc fusion molecule that is expressed in recombinant bacteria. Currently we are producing our Stalaris molecules in E.coli by expression in inclusion bodies and refolding to recreate the native structure. We are working with CDMOs in the United States on the development and GMP manufacturing process for the production of Stalaris preclinical and clinical drug substance and drug product. We have a non-exclusive license to the host-cell line used to produce drug substance for Stalaris. We intend to contract with CROs to conduct labeling, storage and distribution of Stalaris to clinical sites.
Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. We own, or have exclusive licenses to, over 175 issued patents or allowed patent applications with predicted expiration dates ranging from 2026 to 2034. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of Physiocrine therapeutics.
 A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, which is important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or our business could be harmed, possibly materially.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to new methods of treatment, therapeutics and additional new product forms thereof with new therapeutic or pharmacokinetic properties. Specifically, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering our protein therapeutics, next generation product forms and the use of these compositions in a variety of therapies.

The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or a foreign patent office to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such proceedings could result in us incurring substantial costs, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
 The patent portfolios for our most advanced programs are summarized below.
 Resolaris. Our Resolaris patent portfolio is comprised of a number of patent families and includes U.S. Patent No. 8,835,387, which issued on September 16, 2014 and is predicted to expire in 2033; and U.S. Patent No. 9,273,302, which issued on March 1, 2016 and is predicted to expire in 2033. This patent family is jointly owned by us and our 98% owned subsidiary, Pangu Biopharma. Patent applications in the same family as U.S. Patent No. 8,835,387 are pending in a variety of worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia and South Africa. The Resolaris patent portfolio also encompasses additional issued patents and pending patent applications that cover Resolaris and related proteins; these patents and patent applications are wholly owned by us. This second patent family includes U.S. Patent No. 9,127,268, which issued on September 8, 2015; European Patent No. 2509625, which granted on January 28, 2015; Japanese Patent No. 5819314, which granted on October 9, 2015; Chinese Patent No. ZL 201080061989.7, which granted on September 21, 2016; and Australian Patent No. 2010327926, which issued August 21, 2014, and related applications that are pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, China, Japan, and Hong Kong. Patents that issue from these applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2030 plus any patent term extension. Also included with the Resolaris patent portfolio are pending patent applications to specific methods of use of Resolaris and related proteins, and disease polymorphisms of HARS. These applications have been filed in the United States as U.S. provisional applications and in some cases under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT. U.S. provisional applications may be used to establish non-provisional U.S. applications, PCT applications and other national filings worldwide. PCT applications are eligible for filing in most worldwide jurisdictions, including the United States. If issued, these patents are predicted to expire between 2033 and 2034.
 Stalaris. Our Stalaris patent portfolio, includes derivatives of Resokine, including the iMod domain, related splice variants, and next-generation product forms with modified therapeutic activity or pharmacokinetic characteristics, is comprised of a number of patent families and includes U.S. Patent No. 8,404,242, and U.S. Patent No 8,753,638, which issued on March 26, 2013 and June 17, 2014, respectively, and are expected to expire in 2031 and 2030. Also included in this patent family are Japanese Patent No. 5756751, which granted on June 5, 2015; and Australian Patent No. 2010226726, which issued on October 16, 2014. This patent family is jointly owned by us and our 98% owned subsidiary, Pangu Biopharma, and includes pending applications in United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, China, Japan, and Hong Kong. Patents that issue from these applications, if any, are expected to expire in 2030, plus any patent term extension. The Stalaris patent family also includes patent applications filed on related splice variants of HARS. This patent family includes applications that are pending in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, China, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Russia and Hong Kong. This patent family is jointly owned by us and Pangu Biopharma. Also included within the Stalaris patent portfolio are pending applications to specific product forms of Stalaris, Resolaris and other HARS splice variants which include patent families to Fc fusion proteins, pegylated forms and variants with substituted D amino acids. These applications have been filed in the United States as U.S. provisional applications and in some cases under the PCT. If issued, these patents are predicted to expire between 2033 and 2034.
 Our pipeline of Physiocrines is covered by a series of 21 patent families, which covers all 20 human cytosolic tRNA synthetases. At least 19 Physiocrine patents are issued in the United States, and applications are pending to the corresponding Physiocrine polynucleotide sequences.  These cases are jointly owned by us and Pangu Biopharma, and include pending applications in the United States, Australia, Canada, India, Europe, China and Japan. Patents that issue from these applications, if any, would be expected to expire in 2031. Additional patent applications have also been separately filed on GARS (Glycyl-tRNA synthetase), DARS (Aspartyl-tRNA synthetase), YARS (tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase), and other tRNA synthetases, and any patents issuing from these patent applications would be expected to expire between 2026 and 2030. We have also exclusively in-licensed from TSRI, patents and patent applications related to YARS and specific monomeric forms of tRNA synthetases.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest date of filing the non-provisional patent application from which the patent issued.
 18

In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property.
 Research and License Agreements 
 The Scripps Research Institute 
 We are party to an amended and restated research funding and option agreement with The Scripps Research Institute, or TSRI. Under the agreement, we provide funding to TSRI to conduct certain research activities related to aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. The agreement renews automatically for successive 12 month periods starting on May 31 of each year unless we provide written notice of our desire to terminate the agreement at least 30 days prior to the end of the applicable 12-month period. Under the agreement, the parties agree to update the amount of annual funding for such successive 12-month periods as mutually agreed in good faith by the parties. We have the right to terminate the agreement at any time upon six months’ written notice, and TSRI has the right to terminate the agreement if we fail to make any payment under the agreement within ten days of being notified by TSRI that such payment is overdue.

Pangu Biopharma
 In October 2007, we formed our Hong Kong subsidiary, Pangu BioPharma Limited, or Pangu BioPharma, a company registered in Hong Kong, to collaborate with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, or HKUST, on the discovery and development of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase protein therapeutics. We hold 98% of the outstanding shares of Pangu BioPharma, and a subsidiary of HKUST holds the remaining outstanding shares. Beginning in July 2008, Pangu BioPharma, in collaboration with HKUST, entered into a series of three research grant agreements with the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to carry out research in the discovery and development of Physiocrines. In December 2016, Pangu BioPharma renewed its annual joint research agreement with a subsidiary of HKUST, under which Pangu BioPharma agrees to fund research to be performed in 2017 under the agreement by the subsidiary of HKUST with respect to development of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase protein therapeutics. Pangu BioPharma is the sole beneficial owner of all resulting intellectual property rights from the research performed under these agreements, subject to the right of HKUST’s subsidiary to use certain background intellectual property of HKUST in conducting the research and, in the event Pangu BioPharma applies for individual funding of any work under the research programs, compliance with the terms and conditions of any written agreement covering ownership of such funded works. Pangu BioPharma funds the annual research on a quarterly basis. Either party may terminate the agreement during the annual period upon an uncured breach of the agreement by the other party. We are also party to a license agreement with Pangu BioPharma, pursuant to which Pangu BioPharma has granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license (with a right to sublicense) in and to certain of Pangu BioPharma’s solely and jointly owned patent rights and know-how to research, develop, manufacture, use, import, export, distribute, offer for sale, sell and have sold products incorporating such patent rights and know-how for any therapeutic, prognostic or diagnostic use throughout the world.
Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, including federal, state, and local authorities, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, and export and import of pharmaceutical and biological products, such as those we are developing. Pricing of such products is also subject to regulation in many countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or biologic or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, or a new drug application, or NDA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or NDA to file the application for review;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20

 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA or NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA or NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans in clinical trials. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. The FDA may impose a clinical hold at any time during clinical trials and may impose a partial clinical hold that would limit trials, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to generate enough data to evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational new drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA or NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
 Sponsors must also report to the FDA, within certain timeframes, serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate.
 The clinical trial process can take three to ten years or more to complete, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Results from one trial are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials.
 21

A drug being studied in clinical trials may be made available to individual patients in certain circumstances.  Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the later of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the Cures Act or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug. Submission of a BLA or NDA to the FDA.
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA or NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs and NDAs is subject to an application user fee. For fiscal year 2017, the application user fee is $2,038,100, and the sponsor of an approved BLA or NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, set at $97,750 per product and $512,200 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. Applications for orphan drug products are exempted from the BLA and NDA user fees and may be exempted from product and establishment user fees, unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition.
 A BLA or NDA for a new molecular entity must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including trials initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational new drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 Once a BLA or NDA for a new molecular entity has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by the FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 The FDA’s Decision on a BLA or NDA
 The FDA evaluates a BLA to determine whether the data demonstrate that the biologic is safe, pure, and potent, or effective, and an NDA to determine whether the drug is safe and effective.  After the FDA evaluates the BLA or NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the product will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval and issue a denial. The FDA could also approve the BLA or NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. Such post-market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 22

Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of BLAs and NDAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that has potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of fast track designation are more frequent interactions with the FDA during development and testing, the eligibility for priority review, and rolling review, which is submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted. Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant the BLA or NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA or NDA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing trials or completion of ongoing trials after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established the new Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather preclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, and assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates, and expect to rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 23

 
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, untitled or warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or NDAs or supplements to approved BLAs or NDAs, or suspension or revocation of licenses or withdrawal of approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States.
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product is the first to receive FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.
 Pediatric Trials and Exclusivity
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended, BLAs and NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational new drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submissi
on of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs.  The requirements for pediatric data do not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the five-year and three-year non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a BLA or NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of FDA-requested pediatric trials are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection covering the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application relying on the BLA or NDA sponsor’s data.
 24

Patent Term Restoration
 Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or NDA, plus the time between the submission date and the approval of
 that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days of the product’s approval. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA or NDA.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHSA attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) eighteen months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) eighteen months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to an RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug. . . .”
 Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates that the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD and it assigns a therapeutic equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider an “AB” therapeutic equivalence rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of an “AB” rating often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.
 25

Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval.
 Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 European Union/Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. The cost of establishing a regulatory compliance system for numerous varying jurisdictions can be very significant. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and in other jurisdictions, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial authorization application, or CTA, must be submitted for each clinical protocol to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is accepted in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed.
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, the applicable regulatory requirements, and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The content of the BLA or NDA filed in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country.
 Countries that are part of the European Union, as well as countries outside of the European Union, have their own governing bodies, requirements, and processes with respect to the approval of pharmaceutical and biologic products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Authorization Procedures in the European Union
 Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.

The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines.

• | For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.

 In some cases, a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting a marketing authorization application. A PIP describes, among other things, proposed pediatric trials and their timing relative to clinical trials in adults.
 New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
 In the European Union, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which a generic application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 In the 
European Union, the European Commission, after reviewing the opinion of the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions that affect not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community, or when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of such products in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the products. Additionally, orphan drug designation is only available where no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected).
 In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity would not prevent the approval of a similar drug that is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

Exceptional Circumstances/Conditional Approval
 Orphan drugs or drugs with unmet medical needs may be eligible for European Union approval under exceptional circumstances or with conditional approval. Approval under exceptional circumstances may be applicable to orphan products and is used when an applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which the product is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific knowledge does not allow comprehensive information to be provided, or when it is medically unethical to collect such information. Conditional marketing authorization may be applicable to orphan medicinal products, medicinal products for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases, or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to recognized public threats. Conditional marketing authorization can be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs and in the interest of public health, provided the risk-benefit balance is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide the comprehensive clinical data, and unmet medical needs will be fulfilled. Conditional marketing authorization is subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually.
Accelerated Review
 Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third- party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
 The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Some of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, that while not a law, is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the Affordable Care Act that are repealed. Thus, the full impact of the Affordable Care Act, any law replacing elements of it, or the political uncertainty surrounding its repeal or replacement on our business remains unclear.  Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
 28

In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency laws, including the provision of the Affordable Care Act referred to as the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug and biologics manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership interests of physicians and their immediate family members;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Affordable Care Act broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Safeguards we implement to discourage improper payments or offers of payments by our employees, consultants, and others may be ineffective, and violations of the FCPA and similar laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities or proceedings against us, any of which would likely harm our reputation, business, financial condition and result of operations.
 29

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and imprisonment, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
