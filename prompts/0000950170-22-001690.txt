 Item 1. Business
 
Overview
 
On February 27, 2017, Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. II (Hennessy), a special purpose acquisition corporation, consummated the merger of Hennessy’s wholly-owned subsidiary with and into Daseke, Inc. (Daseke, the Company, we, us or our), with Daseke, Inc. surviving as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Hennessy (the Business Combination). Upon consummation of the Business Combination, Daseke, Inc. changed its name to Daseke Companies, Inc. and Hennessy changed its name to Daseke, Inc.
 
Daseke is a premier North American transportation solutions specialist dedicated to servicing challenging industrial end-markets through experienced people, a fleet of more than 4,500 tractors and 11,000 flatbed and specialized trailers, and has operations throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The Company also provides logistical planning and warehousing services to customers. The Company is subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and various state regulatory authorities in the United States. The Company is also subject to regulation by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications and various provincial regulatory authorities in Canada. The Company’s predecessor was incorporated in Delaware in 2008.
 
The Company believes it provides one of the most comprehensive transportation and logistics solutions offerings in the open-deck industry. The Company delivers a diverse offering of transportation and logistics solutions to approximately 5,300 customers across the continental United States, Canada and Mexico through two reportable segments: Flatbed Solutions and Specialized Solutions. The Flatbed Solutions segment focuses on delivering transportation and logistics solutions that principally require the use of flatbed and retractable-sided transportation equipment, and the Specialized Solutions segment focuses on delivering transportation and logistics solutions that require the use of specialized trailering transportation equipment. Excluding intercompany eliminations, the Flatbed Solutions segment generated approximately 44% of total segment revenue in 2021, and the Specialized Solutions segment generated approximately 56% of total revenue in 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the Flatbed Solutions segment operated 2,371 tractors and 4,207 trailers, and the Specialized Solutions segment operated 2,326 tractors and 7,059 trailers. In 2021, Daseke’s company and owner-operator drivers drove 405.5 million miles.
 
Both of the Company’s reportable segments operate highly flexible business models comprised of company-owned tractors and trailers and asset-light operations (which consist of owner-operator transportation, freight brokerage and logistics). The Company’s asset-based operations have the benefit of providing shippers with certainty of delivery and continuity of operations. Alternatively, the Company’s asset-light operations offer flexibility and scalability to meet customers’ dynamic needs and have lower capital expenditure requirements and fixed costs. In 2021, approximately 44% of the Company’s freight, logistics and brokerage revenue was derived from company-owned equipment and approximately 56% was derived from asset-light services.
 
Industry and Competition
 
Open-deck freight is defined as loads secured atop trailer decks without sides or a roof and is generally both complex and time-sensitive, which separates it from traditional dry-van freight. The open-deck industry is focused on different customers with different freight requirements than traditional dry-van and requires highly trained drivers and specialized equipment with the ability to handle uniquely shaped and overweight cargo. Specialized loads often require specific expertise to address the additional administrative paperwork, proper licenses and hauling permits, extensive coordination with local officials and escort vehicles.

Open-deck routes are frequently more irregular than dry-van routes due to the nature of the freight. Open-deck lanes stretch across the country, with particular density around corridors of significant lumber, steel and machinery production, notably in Texas, as well as the Southeast, Midwest, and West Coast regions of the United States.

The open-deck industry is highly competitive and fragmented. The Company competes primarily with other flatbed carriers and to a lesser extent, logistics companies, as well as railroads. The Company competes with other motor carriers for the services of drivers, independent contractors and management employees and with logistics companies for the services of third-party capacity providers and management employees. The Company believes that the principal differentiating factors in its business, relative to competition, are scale, North American footprint of operations, service, efficiency, pricing, the availability and configuration of equipment that satisfies customers’ needs, and its ability to provide comprehensive transportation solutions to customers.


Customers
 
The Company’s customers, many of whom are Fortune 500 companies, rely on it to transport mission-critical loads, making it an integral part of their supply chains. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has approximately 5,300 customers. The Company’s ability to dependably transport high-value, complex and time-sensitive loads as well as provide the value-added logistics services required to plan, transport and deliver loads has resulted in longstanding and established customer relationships. Several of our top customer relationships span more than 20 years on average at the Company’s operating divisions.
 
The Company’s customers represent a broad and attractive range of end markets. Examples of the freight the Company regularly transports include aircraft parts, manufacturing equipment, structural steel, pressure vessels, wind turbine blades, heavy machinery (construction, mining and agriculture), commercial glass, high security cargo, arms, ammunition and explosives (AA&E), lumber and building and construction materials. Because the Company’s customers are generally in the industrial and manufacturing sector, as is typical for open-deck services providers, the Company is not subject to the same consumer-driven demand as dry-van trucking companies, whose freight typically includes consumer goods and whose volume can peak during the holiday season.

In 2021, the Company’s Flatbed Solutions segment provided transportation and logistics solutions to approximately 2,500 customers, and the Company’s Specialized Solutions segment provided unique, value-added transportation and logistics solutions to approximately 3,300 customers. See Note 15 of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for information on its two reportable segments.
 
A material portion of the Company’s revenue is generated from its major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on its business. In 2021 and 2020, the Company’s top ten customers accounted for approximately 27% and 31%, respectively, of its revenue; in 2021, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company's revenue and in 2020, one customer represented approximately 10% of the Company’s revenue.
 
Revenue Equipment
 
As of December 31, 2021, the Company operated 2,623 company-owned tractors and also had under contract 2,074 tractors owned and operated by independent contractors. The Company also operated 11,266 trailers as of December 31, 2021. Growth of its tractor and trailer fleet is determined by market conditions and its experience and expectations regarding equipment utilization and driver recruitment and retention. In acquiring revenue equipment (tractors, trailers and trailer accessories), the Company considers a number of factors, including economy, price, rate, economic environment, technology, warranty terms, manufacturer support, driver comfort and resale value. The Company maintains strong relationships with its equipment vendors and the financial flexibility to react as market conditions dictate.
Human Capital
 
The success and growth of our business is driven by our employees. Our key human capital objectives are to attract, retain, and incentivize talented and experienced existing and future employees to manage and support our operations. We provide our employees compensation and benefit packages, which we believe are competitive within our industry as well as the local markets in which we operate. We understand that providing employees with the resources and support they need to live a healthy life is critical for sustaining a workplace of choice, and our compensation and benefit packages include access for our employees and their families to flexible and convenient health and wellness programs that support their physical, mental, and financial health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health. In response to COVID-19, we implemented safety measures at our various locations, which included remote working when practical, expanded health and safety policies, facility modifications, increased communications to employees regarding the impact of the COVID-19, physical distancing procedures, personal protective equipment, and cleaning supplies, increased cleaning protocols, expanding the use of virtual meetings, and minimizing non-essential travel.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 4,006 employees, which included 2,454 company drivers. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
 
We value providing opportunity to people regardless of background and strongly believe that diversity and inclusion make us stronger as a company. We reaffirm our commitment to equal employment opportunity for all people and comply with all applicable federal and state laws pertaining to equal employment opportunity. It is our philosophy to treat our employees and applicants fairly without regard to race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability, present, past, or future service in any branch of the uniformed services of the United States,
citizenship, sexual orientation or gender identity. Our management teams and all of our employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace.
 
The Company also contracts with owner-operator drivers to provide and operate tractors, which provide additional revenue equipment capacity. Independent contractors own or lease their own tractors and are responsible for all associated expenses, including financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance and highway use taxes. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 2,309 independent contractors, who accounted for approximately 45% of total miles in 2021.
 
The Company’s strategy for both company and owner-operator drivers is to (i) use safe and experienced drivers (the majority of driver positions hired require twelve months of over-the-road experience); (ii) promote retention with positive working conditions and a competitive compensation package in the case of company drivers and contracted rates in the case of owner-operator drivers; and (iii) foster a safety-first culture through screening, mandatory drug testing, continuous training, electronic logging system and rewards for accident-free driving. The Company also seeks to minimize turnover of company drivers by providing highly attractive tractors and focusing on providing upgraded nationwide facilities. As a result, at least one of the Company’s operating companies has been named to the Truckload Carriers Association’s 20 Best Fleets to Drive For® in North America each year since 2010.
 
Safety
 
The Company takes pride in its safety-focused culture and conducts mandatory intensive orientation for all of its drivers. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) requires that the Company perform drug and alcohol testing that meets DOT regulations, and its safety program includes pre-employment, random and post-accident drug testing and all other testing required by the DOT. The Company also equips its company tractors with critical-event recorders to help continually train drivers and widely deploys truck-mounted cameras, so that the Company can mitigate or reduce the severity of accidents and claims.
Risk Management
 
The primary safety-related risks associated with the Company’s business include damage to cargo hauled, physical damage to company equipment, damage to buildings and personal property, third-party personal injury and property damage and workers’ compensation. The Company regularly reviews insurance limits and retentions. The Company’s historic auto liability retention, in the majority of instances, was $0.5 million per occurrence. However, after setting up a risk retention group in 2021, our auto liability retention, has increased to $2.0 million per occurrence. In addition, the Company has secured excess liability coverage of up to $48.0 million per occurrence with retention limits of $7.0 million in aggregate.
 
To the extent under dispatch and in furtherance of the Company’s business, its owner-operators are covered by the Company’s liability coverage. However, each such owner-operator is responsible for physical damage to his or her own equipment, occupational accident coverage, workers' compensation, and liability exposure while the truck is used for non-company purposes.
 
Fuel
 
The Company actively manages its fuel purchasing network in an effort to maintain adequate fuel supplies and reduce its fuel costs. The Company purchases its fuel through a network of retail truck stops with which it has negotiated volume purchasing discounts. The Company seeks to reduce its fuel costs by routing its drivers to truck stops with which the Company has negotiated volume purchase discounts when fuel prices at such stops are lower than the bulk rate paid for fuel at the Company’s terminals. The Company stores fuel in aboveground and underground storage tanks at some of its facilities.
 
To help offset increases in fuel prices, the Company utilizes a fuel surcharge program designed to compensate the Company for fuel costs above a certain cost per gallon base. Generally, the Company receives fuel surcharges on the miles for which it is compensated by customers. However, in some cases, a customer may request an all-in freight rate without a separate contracted fuel surcharge. In those instances, the Company invoices the all-in freight rate to the customer and allocates an estimated portion of the freight revenue to fuel surcharge revenue. In addition to its fuel surcharge program, the Company believes the most effective protection against fuel cost increases is to maintain a fuel-efficient fleet by incorporating fuel efficiency measures. The Company does not currently use derivatives as a hedge against higher fuel costs.
 
Seasonality
 
In the transportation industry, results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern. The Company’s productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and end-user activity, and some shippers reduce their shipments during winter. At the same time, operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather, creating higher accident frequency, increased claims and higher equipment repair expenditures. The Company also may suffer from weather-related or other events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes and explosions, which may increase in frequency or intensity due to climate change.
Regulation
 
The Company’s operations are regulated and licensed by various federal, provincial, state, local and foreign government agencies in the United States and Canada. In the United States, the Company and its drivers must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT and the agencies within the states that regulate transportation, including those regulations relating to drug- and alcohol-testing and hours-of-service. Weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to government regulations. The Company also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions, environmental protection, drivers’ hours-of-service, driver eligibility requirements, on-board reporting of operations, collective bargaining, ergonomics and other matters affecting safety, insurance and operating methods. Other agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also regulate the Company’s equipment, operations, drivers and the environment. The Company conducts operations outside of the United States, and is subject to analogous governmental safety, fitness, weight and equipment regulations and environmental protection and operating standards. For example, in Canada, the Company must conduct its operations in various provinces pursuant to operating authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications in those provinces. The Company is also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which generally prohibits United States companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining favorable treatment. If the Company is not in compliance with the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), it may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could harm its reputation and have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Any investigation of any actual or alleged violations of such laws could also harm the Company’s reputation or have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
Transportation Regulations
    The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), imposes safety and fitness regulations on the Company and its drivers. In addition, the Company’s subsidiaries that act as property brokers have property broker licenses issued by the FMCSA.
    In June 2020, FMCSA revised its Hours-of-Service Rule, which addresses safety issues such as the maximum amount of time that drivers are permitted to be on duty to ensure that drivers stay awake and alert. The revised rule provided flexibility by requiring drivers to take 30-minute breaks after eight hours of consecutive driving time (rather than on-duty time) and the requirement can be satisfied by any non-driving period of 30 consecutive minutes. The revised rule also expands the driving window during adverse driving conditions by an additional two hours, updates the sleeper birth provision to provide more flexibility, and expands the short-haul exception that exempts certain drivers from the requirements when they operate within a 150 air-mile radius of their reporting location and do not exceed a 14-hour duty period.
    The FMCSA has adopted a data-driven Compliance, Safety and Accountability (the CSA) program as its safety enforcement and compliance model. The CSA program holds motor carries and drivers accountable for their role in safety by evaluating and ranking fleets and individual drivers on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program affects drivers because their safety performance and compliance impact their safety records and, while working for a carrier, will impact their carrier’s safety record. The methodology for determining a carrier’s DOT safety rating relies upon implementation of Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (BASIC) applicable to the on-road safety performance of the carrier’s drivers and certain of those rating results are provided on the FMCSA’s Carrier Safety Measurement System website. As a result, certain current and potential drivers may no longer be eligible to drive for the Company, the Company’s fleet could be ranked poorly as compared to its peer firms, and the Company’s safety rating could be adversely impacted. The occurrence of future deficiencies could affect driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment (in the case of company drivers) or contracts (in the case of owner-operator drivers) with other carriers, or could cause the Company’s customers to direct their business away from the Company and to carriers with better fleet safety rankings, either of which would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and productivity. Additionally, the Company may incur greater than expected expenses in its attempts to improve its scores as a result of such poor rankings. Those carriers and drivers identified under the CSA program as exhibiting poor BASIC scores are prioritized for interventions, such as warning letters and roadside investigations, either of which may adversely affect the Company’s results
of operations. To promote improvement in all CSA categories, including those both over and under the established scoring threshold, the Company has procedures in place to address areas where it has exceeded the thresholds and the Company continually reviews all safety-related policies, programs and procedures for their effectiveness and revises them, as necessary, to establish positive improvement. However, the Company cannot assure you these measures will be effective.
 
The methodology used to determine a carrier’s safety rating could be changed by the FMCSA and, as a result, the Company’s acceptable safety rating could be impaired. In particular, the FMCSA continues to utilize the three safety fitness rating scale—“satisfactory,” “conditional,” and “unsatisfactory”—to assess the safety fitness of motor carriers and the Company currently has a “satisfactory” FMCSA rating on 100% of its fleet. However, pursuant to a 2015 federal statutory mandate, the FMCSA commissioned the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct a study and report upon the CSA program and its underlying Safety Measurement System (SMS), which is the FMCSA’s process for identifying patterns of non-compliance and issuing safety-fitness determinations for motor carriers. In June 2017, the NAS published a report on the subject providing specific recommendations and concluding, among other things, that the FMCSA should explore a more formal statistical model to replace the current SMS process. In June 2018, the FMCSA posted its response to the NAS study in a report to Congress, concluding, among other things, that it would develop and test a new model, the Item Response Theory (IRT), which would replace the SMS process currently used. The FMCSA has completed small scale testing of the IRT model and is evaluating next steps to roll out the program. The FMCSA’s June 2018 response was audited by the DOT Inspector General to assess consistency with the NAS recommendations, and the agency extended its timeline for considering the IRT model as a potential replacement for the SMS to September 2020; the FMCSA did not meet that deadline and the anticipated timing to finalize its decision is unclear. In the event and to the extent that the FMCSA adopts the IRT model in replacement of the SMS or otherwise pursues rulemakings in the future that revise the methodology used to determine a carrier’s safety rating in a manner that incorporates more stringent standards, then it is possible that the Company and other motor carriers could be adversely affected, as compared to consideration of the current standards. If the Company were to receive an unsatisfactory CSA score, whether under the current SMS process, the IRT model, should it be finalized, and adopted, or as a result of some other safety-fitness determination, it could adversely affect the Company’s business as some of its existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating, and an unsatisfactory rating could negatively impact or restrict the Company’s operations.
 
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, federal, state and municipal authorities implemented and continue to implement various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. This could reduce the pool of qualified drivers, which could require the Company to increase driver compensation or owner-operator contracted rates, limit fleet growth or allow trucks to be non-productive. Consequently, it is possible that the Company may fail to meet the needs of customers or may incur increased expenses.
 
The FMCSA published a final rule in December 2015 mandating the use of Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs) for commercial motor vehicle drivers to measure their compliance with hours-of-service requirements by December 18, 2017. The 2015 ELD final rule generally applies to most motor carriers and drivers who are required to keep records of duty status, unless they qualify for an exception to the rule, and the rule also applies to drivers domiciled in Canada and Mexico. Starting December 16, 2019, all carriers and drivers subject to the 2015 final rule, including the Company, must use ELDs.
 
Environmental Regulations
 
The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the operation of fuel storage tanks, release of emissions from its vehicles (including engine idling) and facilities, and adverse impacts to the environment, including to the soil, groundwater and surface water. The Company has implemented programs designed to monitor and address identified environmental risks. Historically, the Company’s environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on its business or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. Additionally, certain of the Company’s operating companies are partners in the EPA’s SmartWay Transport Partnership, a voluntary program promoting energy efficiency and air quality. If the Company fails to comply with applicable environmental laws or regulations, the Company could be subject to costs and liabilities. Those costs and liabilities may include the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of its operations in a particular area. The occurrence of any one or more of such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and operating results.
 
The Company maintains bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at some of its terminals. The Company also has vehicle maintenance operations at certain of its facilities. The Company’s operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage into the environment, discharge of contaminants, environmental and natural resource damage, and unauthorized hazardous material spills, releases or disposal actions, among others. Some of the Company’s operations are at facilities where soil and groundwater contamination have occurred, and the Company or its predecessors have been responsible for remediating environmental contamination at some locations. In the past, the Company has also been responsible for the costs of cleanup of cargo and diesel fuel spills caused during its transportation operations, including as a result of
traffic accidents or other events. If the Company is found to be responsible for such contamination or spills, the Company could be subject to costs and liabilities, including costs for remediation, environmental and natural resource damages and penalties.
 
In October 2016, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) jointly published final Phase 2 standards for improving fuel efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from new on-road medium- and heavy-duty vehicles beginning for model year 2019 and extending through model year 2027. The Phase 2 standards build upon the Phase 1 standards, encouraging wider application of currently available technologies and the development of new and advanced cost-effective technologies through model year 2027. In addition, greenhouse gas emissions limits and fuel efficiency standards will be imposed on new trailers. The Phase 2 standards were challenged in federal court, and the litigation remains in abeyance while the EPA reviews the standards. The Company expects that these Phase 2 standards, if unchanged to make less stringent, will result in its incurrence of increased costs for acquiring new tractors and for additional parts and maintenance activities to retrofit its tractors with technology to achieve compliance with such standards. Such increased costs could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and profitability, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. Additionally, in November 2018, the EPA announced the Cleaner Trucks Initiative (CTI), pursuant to which it plans to issue a rule updating standards for nitrogen oxide emissions from highway heavy-duty trucks and engines. On August 5, 2021, the EPA announced it will roll out a series of three rulemakings intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from heavy-duty trucks starting in model year 2027 to implement the CTI program. The Company cannot predict, however, when the EPA may issue the proposed rules and the extent to which its operations and productivity will be adversely impacted, by these or any other new fuel or emission restrictions.
 
Notwithstanding the federal standards, a number of states have mandated, and states may continue to individually mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment that could increase equipment or other costs for entire fleets. For instance, the California Air Resources Board also has adopted emission control regulations that are applicable to all heavy-duty tractors that pull 53-foot or longer box-type trailers within the state of California. The tractors and trailers subject to these regulations must be either EPA Smart Way certified or equipped with low-rolling resistance tires and retrofitted with Smart Way-approved aerodynamic technologies. The Company currently purchases Smart Way certified equipment in certain of its new tractor and trailer acquisitions. In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have also begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. These restrictions could force the Company to alter its drivers’ behavior, purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or face a decrease in productivity.
 
Federal and state lawmakers also have implemented or proposed potential limits on greenhouse gas emissions under a variety of other climate-change initiatives. Compliance with such regulations may increase the cost of new tractors and trailers or require the Company to retrofit its equipment, and could impair equipment productivity and increase its operating expenses. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual value of these vehicles, could materially increase the Company’s operating expenses or otherwise adversely affect its operations.
 
Insurance Regulations
 
The Company’s wholly-owned risk retention group is a captive insurance company formed and licensed under the laws of the State of South Carolina, which qualifies as a risk retention group pursuant to the federal and the federal Liability Risk Retention Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. §§ 3901 et seq. (the Risk Retention Act). Captive insurance companies generally are subject to less stringent regulatory requirements and oversight than commercial insurance companies.
   Primary responsibility for the regulation of the Company’s risk retention group is exercised by the South Carolina Department of Insurance (the SCDOI) under The Insurance Law of South Carolina. The Insurance Law of South Carolina, among other things, prescribes solvency standards that must be met and maintained and imposes certain regulatory reporting requirements.
   In addition, the risk retention group must comply with the Risk Retention Act and applicable state risk retention statutes complementing the Risk Retention Act, which authorize the formation of risk retention groups to provide liability insurance to persons or firms engaged in businesses or activities that are similar or related with respect to the liability (other than personal risk liability or employers’ liability) to which such firms are exposed. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in monetary penalties and/or the suspension or revocation of the risk retention group’s license. [HL1] Many provisions of the Risk Retention Act have not been construed by the courts or any regulatory agency. The operations of the Company’s risk retention group may have to be modified in the future to be consistent with any subsequent interpretations.
