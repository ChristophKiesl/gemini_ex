Item 1. Business.
Overview
    The Simply Good Foods Company is a consumer packaged food and beverage company that aims to lead the nutritious snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient, innovative, great-tasting, better-for-you snacks and meal replacements. The product portfolio we develop, market and sell consists primarily of protein bars, ready-to-drink (“RTD”) shakes, sweet and salty snacks and confectionery products marketed under the Atkins®, Atkins Endulge®, and Quest® brand names. Simply Good Foods is poised to expand its wellness platform through innovation and organic growth along with acquisition opportunities in the nutritional snacking space.
    The Company’s nutritious snacking platform consists of brands that specialize in providing products for consumers that follow certain nutritional philosophies and health-and-wellness trends: Atkins® for those following a low-carb lifestyle and Quest® for consumers seeking a variety of protein-rich foods and beverages that also limit sugars and simple carbs. We distribute our products in major retail channels, primarily in North America, including grocery, club, and mass merchandise, as well as through e-commerce, convenience, specialty, and other channels. Our portfolio of nutritious snacking brands gives us a strong platform with which to introduce new products, expand distribution, and attract new consumers to our products.
    We believe snacking occasions have been on the rise in recent years as consumers desire more convenient, healthy and delicious foods, snacks, and meal replacements. We believe our emphasis on product formats such as our protein bars, cookies, chips, and RTD shakes positions us to fill important needs for consumers. We believe a number of existing and emerging consumer trends within the U.S. food and beverage industry will continue to both drive the growth of the nutritional snacking category and increase the demand for our product offerings. Some of these trends include increased consumption of smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day, consumers’ strong preference for convenient, “better-for-you” snacks, consumers’ greater focus on health and wellness, and consumers’ movement toward limiting carbohydrate and sugar consumption, as well as the trend of consumers seeking to add convenient sources of protein and fiber to their diets.
    With our Atkins brand, we strive to offer a compelling line of protein bars, RTD shakes, cookies, and confections, and with our Quest brand, we strive to offer an attractive line up of protein bars, cookies, pizza, protein chips, RTD shakes, and confections, which target these existing and emerging consumer trends. Our sales, marketing, and research and development capabilities enable us to distribute products to a national customer base across a spectrum of retail channels, including the mass merchandise, grocery, and drug channels, club stores, e-commerce, and small format retail such as convenience stores and gas stations.
    Simply Good Foods was formed in Delaware on March 30, 2017, to consummate the Business Combination, which occurred on July 7, 2017. As part of our strategy to become an industry leading snacking platform, in November 2019, we acquired Quest Nutrition, LLC. We refer to this transaction as the “Quest Acquisition.”
    In addition to pursuing attractive run-rate cost synergies over time by leveraging efficiencies of scale with our legacy Atkins business, we completed the Quest Acquisition to realize several other potential benefits. Quest’s products compete in many attractive, fast growing sub-segments within the nutritional snacking category and we expect Quest’s research and development insights and capabilities to benefit our broader business. Quest also has an extremely loyal following and strong appeal among consumers ages 18-35, which complements Atkins’ strength among consumers ages 35+. The Quest Acquisition allows us to benefit from Quest’s existing relationships and effectiveness within certain channels of trade, such as e-commerce and the small format channel, and leverage Quest’s social media-based marketing capabilities. We have benefited from utilizing certain of Quest’s systems, such as its enterprise resource planning platform, and associated reporting tools.
    Our principal executive offices are located at 1225 17th Street, Suite 1000, Denver, Colorado, 80202. Our telephone number is (303) 633-2840. We maintain a web site at www.thesimplygoodfoodscompany.com.
Effects of COVID-19
    Our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2021 continued to be affected by the significant changes in consumer shopping and consumption behavior patterns due to COVID-19 which had begun during our third quarter in fiscal 2020. Our business did improve during the course of fiscal year 2021, driven by increasing consumer mobility and improving shopper traffic in brick and mortar retailers versus the prior periods that were pressured by COVID-19 movement restrictions. We believe there is a high correlation of consumer mobility to the consumption of our products. As shopper traffic within brick and mortar retailers improves, particularly in the mass and convenience store channels, and as consumers spend more time away from home, our business, particularly bars, performs well. There is still uncertainty related to the sustainability of improving consumer mobility and shopping trips observed in 
the second half of fiscal year 2021. While our Quest brand has outperformed its portion of the nutritious snacking segment, the performance of our Atkins brand, which is part of the weight management portion of the market, has improved at a slower rate. However, the Atkins brand performance for the fifty-two weeks ended August 28, 2021 has improved during the course of fiscal year 2021, primarily due to increasing consumer mobility and improving shopper traffic in brick and mortar retailers. During fiscal year 2022, we expect our business performance will continue to be correlated primarily to the level of consumer mobility, which includes the rate at which consumers return to working outside the home.
    Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, we actively engaged with the various elements of our value chain, including our retail customers, contract manufacturers, and logistics and transportation providers, to meet demand for our products and to remain informed of any challenges within our value chain. In the fourth quarter of 2020 and continuing into fiscal year 2021, consumer consumption habits became steadier, however inventory levels remain variable. Based on information available to us as of the date of this Report, we believe we will be able to deliver our products to meet customer orders on a timely basis, and therefore, we expect our products will continue to be available for purchase to meet consumer meal replacement and snacking needs for the foreseeable future. We continue to monitor customer and consumer demand along with our logistics capabilities to deliver products to our retail customers on a timely and consistent basis, and intend to adapt our plans as needed to continue to drive our business and meet our obligations during the continuing and evolving COVID-19 situation.
    We remain uncertain of the ultimate effect COVID-19 could have on our business notwithstanding the distribution of several U.S. government approved vaccines and the easing of movement restrictions. This uncertainty stems from the potential for, among other things, (i) the presence of current mutations of COVID-19 which have resulted in increased rates of reported cases for which currently approved vaccines are not as effective along with the possibility of future mutations occurring for which current approved vaccines are less effective, (ii) unexpected supply chain disruptions, including disruptions resulting from labor shortages or other human capital challenges, (iii) changes to customer operations, (iv) a reversal in recently improving consumer purchasing and consumption behavior, and (v) the closure of customer establishments.
Our Strengths
    Powerful brands with strong consumer awareness and loyalty. We are a leader in the fast growing nutritional snacking category, and both the Atkins and Quest brands are leading brands with scale in protein bars, confections, and cookies for both brands, RTD shakes for the Atkins brand, and chips and pizza for the Quest brand. Our highly focused snacking portfolio provides us with a leading position within retailers’ nutrition and wellness aisles, resulting in meaningful shelf space. Our brands are able to appeal to both consumers interested in an active lifestyle who are seeking protein-rich, low-carb snacking options as well as weight management program consumers, which makes our brands highly attractive and strategic for a diverse set of retailers across various distribution channels.
    Aligned with consumer mega trends. Increasing global concern about growing rates of obesity and weight-related diseases and other health issues has resulted in increased scientific, media and consumer focus on nutrition. Over 100 independent, peer reviewed, clinical studies show the benefits of controlling carbohydrates. Management believes that this focus is prompting consumers to rebalance their nutritional breakdown away from carbohydrates. In fact, 73% of consumers are seeking to lower their carbohydrate intake according to Health Focus International. Our brand attributes, “low-carb,” “low-sugar” and “protein-rich” nutrition, are well aligned with consumer mega trends. In addition, we believe consumers’ eating habits are gradually shifting towards increased convenience, snacking and meal replacement. We also believe our portfolio of convenient and nutritious products and our ongoing effort to meet consumer demands for “cleaner labels,” which we define as products made with fewer, simpler and more recognizable ingredients, are strategically aligned with these trends.
    Scalable snacking and food platform. We have been able to grow our product offerings for both of our nutritious snacking brands through our line extensions and through acquisitions. Our in-house product development experience, combined with our outsourced manufacturing model, allow us to bring new products to market quickly. We pride ourselves on knowing our consumers and mining insights that lead to new products and ideas. We believe we can leverage our strong relationships with our retail customers and distributors, a strong brand building track record, and category management expertise to help new products, brands and brand extensions gain distribution and consumer recognition, allowing us to continue to successfully expand our snacking platform.
    Asset-light business with strong cash generation. We retain core in-house capabilities including sales, marketing, brand management, customer relationships, product development, and supply-chain expertise, while collaborating with a diversified pool of contract manufacturers and distributors to execute manufacturing and distribution. Outsourcing these competencies allows us to focus our efforts on innovation, marketing, and sales to meet consumer demands. Our lean infrastructure allows for significant flexibility, speed-to-market, and minimal capital investment, which translates into relatively consistent and robust free cash flow generation over time, driven by strong gross margins.
    Experienced leadership team. Simply Good Foods has an experienced team of industry veterans with extensive experience across multiple branded consumer products, food and nutrition categories. For example, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph 
Scalzo, has significant experience operating packaged goods businesses, having served in various leadership roles at Dean Foods, WhiteWave Foods, The Gillette Company, The Coca-Cola Company, and The Procter & Gamble Company. Our management team’s extensive experience is complemented by the significant industry expertise of our directors James Kilts, the former Chief Executive Officer of The Gillette Company and Nabisco, and former President of Kraft USA and Oscar Mayer, and David West, the former Chief Executive Officer of Big Heart Pet Brands and The Hershey Company. Our management team’s deep expertise and proven record of accomplishment in managing brands and operating packaged food businesses is a key driver of our success and positions Simply Good Foods as an attractive vehicle for future long-term growth within the nutritional snacking space.
Our Strategies
    Leverage platform to expand in attractive food and snacking categories. Management believes the fragmented snacking category presents an opportunity for consolidation and the opportunity to build, through disciplined acquisitions, a leading platform in the nutritional snacking space. As a leader in nutritious snacking, we believe we have the unique capability to leverage our operating platform, product innovation expertise and customer relationships to expand beyond the Atkins and Quest brands. In addition, we believe the nutritious snacking category will continue to grow given its relatively low household penetration and favorable consumer trends of snacking, health and wellness, convenience, and on-the-go consumption. Our experienced management team has deep expertise in brand building that we believe will help us to expand the business into additional brands and products in the snacking segment. Over time, we expect to continue seeking to identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities to complement our platform, and we see significant opportunity for growth and synergies in complementary adjacent snacking categories such as the “better-for-you” eating space.
    Innovate and expand the portfolio of product offerings to meet consumer demand for higher protein products and new product forms. We intend to continue to enhance, strengthen and expand our product offerings with new and innovative flavors and forms and packaging alternatives, all while maintaining a commitment to delivering products that meet our nutritional profile and provide the convenience that consumers crave. Our in-house research and development laboratories allow us to develop new products internally and bring them to market quickly through our contract manufacturing network without diverging from high standards of taste, nutritional content, quality, and safety. Additionally, we intend to satisfy developing and changing consumer preferences through the pursuit of merger and acquisition transactions.
    Expand distribution in white space opportunities. In the fifty-two weeks ended August 28, 2021, approximately 76% of Atkins’ gross sales in the U.S. and approximately 53% of Quest’s gross sales in the U.S. were through the mass retailer and grocery distribution channels. Our management believes there is opportunity for the brands to further penetrate those channels as well as other distribution channels such as convenience and club stores. In addition, while shoppers have increased e-commerce purchases generally, approximately 9% of Atkins’ gross sales for the fifty-two weeks ended August 28, 2021 were through its e-commerce channel as compared to approximately 24% of Quest’s gross sales for the same period were through its e-commerce channel. We intend to leverage our brand recognition to develop further the distribution channels through which we reach consumers, including through the continued expansion of the e-commerce channel.
    Continue our marketing efforts to increase household penetration. We intend to expand our marketing efforts to bring first-time buyers into the Atkins and Quest brand franchises. Consumers who have tried our Atkins and Quest products have a relatively high repeat buying rate and long-term buying behavior, as evidenced by servings per buyer, per year. For our Atkins brand, our historic consumer base has been people interested in weight loss, and for the Quest brand it has been individuals pursuing a performance-based active and athletic lifestyle.
    For both the Atkins and the Quest brands, we have an active and growing digital and social presence, using a comprehensive approach of search, banner, and search engine optimization efforts. We are a leader in social media, with a top-tier presence on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter and YouTube. We also have a growing network of social influencers, who promote our products in their targeted social media posts. We believe that social media is a cost-effective way of continuing to attract and retain our consumers. We believe that our ongoing efforts to educate consumers about the benefits of a lower carbohydrate lifestyle will further reinforce our brands. For our Atkins brand, we use targeted broadcast and streaming television and print ads with a celebrity-based campaign that attempts to motivate potential programmatic weight loss consumers to try the Atkins approach to healthier eating and weight loss as these Atkins consumers are our most loyal, profitable and frequent purchasers. For our Quest brand, we have recently launched a national, targeted broadcast ad campaign, and continue to leverage targeted streaming television ads and an extensive network of social media influencers who prompt our Quest brand products through their online posts to motivate new buyers and new product introductions.
    Further develop our brand marketing strategies to reach consumers beyond our core historic buyers. We intend to continue to make focused changes to our approach to consumer outreach to attract consumers beyond our historic core buyers. For the Atkins brand, we intend to continue our marketing efforts to attract self-directed low-carbohydrate eaters (those individuals not on a program diet) who buy and consume our Atkins products. For our Quest brand, we intend to continue our marketing efforts to reach consumers who are seeking products that are aligned with their choice to pursue a healthy and active lifestyle. We also note the Atkins brand has 
approximately 93% aided brand awareness with U.S. consumers and the Quest brand has approximately 77% aided brand awareness with U.S. consumers.
Our Vision and Mission
    Our vision is to lead the nutritional snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient, innovative, great-tasting, better-for-you snacks and meal replacements. Our mission is to empower healthy lives through smart and satisfying nutrition.
Our Products
Core Atkins Products
    Our core Atkins brand products consist of protein bars, RTD shakes, cookies and confections.
    Protein Bars. To keep on-the-go consumers energized and fueled, our Atkins bars offer a convenient and effective solution, providing consumers with protein, fiber and a delicious taste. Atkins offers two main types of bars: Atkins Meal Bars and Atkins Snack Bars. Atkins Meal Bars contain 13 to 17 grams of protein and are available in more than 10 different flavors. Atkins Snack Bars contain 7 to 13 grams of protein, with 2 to 4 grams of net carbs, and are available in 15 different varieties.

Our Atkins’ Plus RTD shakes contain 30 grams of protein, for our consumers seeking higher protein content.
    Confections. Our Atkins Endulge® line, which is designed to satisfy consumers’ sweet cravings, and which we call Treats, consists of delicious desserts without all of the added sugar. Atkins offers a variety of different Treats, such as peanut butter cups and pecan caramel clusters, each with only 1 gram of sugar or less and low net carbs, providing consumers with the option to indulge.
    Cookies. First launched in fiscal year 2021, Atkins’ soft and chewy cookie products are a convenient source of high-protein combined with low net carbs and low-sugar. These sweet tasting cookies are available in double chocolate chip, peanut butter and chocolate chip. Atkins’ cookies contain approximately 10 grams of protein, 3 grams of net carbs and approximately 1 gram of sugar or less depending on the flavor.
    Licensed Frozen Meals. Atkins signed a license agreement with Bellisio Foods, Inc., or “Bellisio,” to license its frozen meals business. Bellisio manufactures, distributes, markets, promotes and sells Atkins frozen food products under the Atkins licensed marks. These products include Atkins branded frozen breakfasts, lunches and dinners. With a large selection of meal types, including pizzas, breakfast bowls and more, we believe our frozen meals offer a great way to learn the basics of protein-rich, low-carbohydrate and low-sugar eating in a simple, convenient and delicious way. The scope of the license includes all frozen meals across all retail channels (excluding online), in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
    Recipes. While provided free of charge, we also offer over 1,600 protein-rich, low-carbohydrate and low-sugar recipes designed to help consumers achieve and maintain a healthy lifestyle, while still enjoying delicious food.
Core Quest Products
    Our core Quest brand products consist of protein bars, cookies, chips, confections and thin crust pizza.
    Protein Bars. To keep on-the-go consumers energized and fueled, our Quest bars offer a convenient and effective solution, providing consumers with protein, fiber and a delicious taste. The typical Quest bar profile contains about 20 grams of protein, 5 grams or less of net carbs and about 1 gram of sugar. Quest offers more than 25 different flavors of protein bars.
    Cookies. First launched in 2018, Quest’s cookie products are a convenient source of high-protein combined with low net carbs and low-sugar. Available in a variety of flavors including Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter, Oatmeal Raisin and Snickerdoodle, Quest’s cookies typically contain about 15 grams of protein, 4 grams or less of net carbs and less than 1 gram of sugar.
    Chips. Quest’s protein chips, including the tortilla-style chips launched in spring 2018, quickly became a high-selling product offering an attractive nutrition profile when compared to conventional chip products. Offered in flavors including nacho cheese, ranch, chili lime, BBQ, sour cream & onion, and cheddar & sour cream, Quest’s chips typically contain about 18 grams of protein, about 4 grams of net carbs, and around 6 grams of fat compared to 2 grams of protein, 15 grams of net carbs and 8 grams of fat for a well-known leading conventional brand.
    Confections. Launched in fiscal year 2021, confections include peanut butter cups and “fudgey” brownie and “gooey” caramel candy bites sold in a variety of packaging. The peanut butter cups feature a nutrition profile for two cups of 11 grams of protein, 1 gram of net carbs, less than 1 gram of sugar and 4 grams of fiber. The candy bites feature a nutrition profile of 5 grams of protein, 1 gram of net carbs, less than 1 gram of sugar, and candy bars feature 4 grams of fiber to 12 grams of protein, 3 grams of net carbs, 1 gram of sugar and 9 grams of fiber.
    Pizza. Launched in summer 2018, Quest’s thin crust frozen pizza offers consumers a pizza experience with an improved nutritional profile versus other leading frozen pizza brands. Sold in a variety of topping combinations including 4-cheese, uncured pepperoni, and supreme, Quest’s pizzas feature a nutrition profile that generally supplies about 29 grams of protein, 6 grams of net carbs or less, around 3 grams of sugar and about 18 grams of fiber compared to 12 grams of protein, 32 grams of net carbs, 2 grams of sugar and 1 gram of fiber for a well-known leading frozen pizza brand.
Marketing, Advertising and Consumer Outreach
    Our marketing efforts are designed to increase consumer awareness of and demand for our products. We employ a broad mix of marketing, including coupons, in-store product sampling, consumer and trade events, advertising (television, online and print) and recipe and food plans, to target our consumers. We also use online resources, including social media sites, to communicate with consumers and build interest in our brands. Our advertising and use of online resources are aimed at increasing consumer preference and usage of our brands. Our trade promotions focus on obtaining retail feature and display support, achieving optimum retail product prices and securing retail shelf space. We use coupons (freestanding insert newspaper, store register, on-pack and online mail coupons) to help stimulate product trial and repeat purchases by providing consumers with economic incentives. The mix of these marketing activities varies between the Atkins and Quest brands.
    We have devoted portions of our respective brand websites to interactive communities designed to promote consumer dialogue about the nutritional values and benefits of our products and suggestions for their use. Our sales and marketing team gathers information and feedback from consumers and retailers to enable us to better meet changing consumer needs. We also believe that an effective marketing tool is to share educational information through our brand websites to explain each brand’s approach to nutrition, teaching consumers how to make smarter food choices and the nutritional qualities of our products. We also provide access to consumer service representatives to answer questions and educate consumers on nutrition, new products and developments.
    For both brands, in order to facilitate awareness and knowledge of the health benefits of a low-carbohydrate, low-sugar and protein-rich eating approach, we have established a variety of marketing and advertising strategies to connect with consumers, including digital marketing and social media platforms, television broadcast and streaming advertising as well as celebrity and social media influencer endorsements.
    For both brands, we have built large consumer followings. Beyond the core historic consumers for each of our brands, we believe there is significant opportunity to increase household penetration for our products by expanding our marketing, product offerings and educational efforts to consumers who are focused more generally on long-term healthy living.
    In the fifty-two weeks ended August 28, 2021, approximately 66% of Selling and marketing expenses were spent on advertising costs.
Product Innovation
    A portion of our sales is driven by new products, and as a result, we believe innovation is, and will continue to be, an important component of our business. We take a deliberate approach to new product development, focusing on enhancing existing products, innovating flavor and form varieties, and expanding into adjacent snacking products. Our innovation model is designed to respond to competitive demands, with a primary focus on enhancing the quality and flavor of our products while simplifying composition and reducing the number of ingredients to meet consumer demands for cleaner labels.
    Our innovation strategy is based on ongoing research into consumers’ healthy lifestyle and nutritional needs. We pride ourselves on knowing our consumers and developing products that meet their needs. Providing variety in snacking options to our consumers is an important strategy in our product innovation. New flavors, textures and snacking formats are important to meeting consumer needs.
    Management believes that an important component of meeting consumers’ nutritional needs is a focus on evolving current products and creating new products with cleaner and fewer ingredients. Accordingly, we are committed to continually finding new and innovative formulations to reduce the number of ingredients in our products, as well as using “better-for-you” ingredients like nuts, fiber and whey protein, while continually improving taste and quality.
    We maintain an in-house research and development team as well as market research and consumer insight capabilities. Through our research and development labs in El Segundo, California and Louisville, Colorado, we control our brands’ innovations and product formulations from the ground up. By developing new products, prototypes and adjacencies in-house, we facilitate our core competencies in product innovation, and enhance our speed to market.
    In addition, as part of our innovation process, we collaborate with nationally recognized third-party flavor providers and product development firms for new product development and then conduct our own proprietary consumer research to identify and improve upon new product concepts. We plan to continue conducting extensive consumer research to develop successful new products including product flavor and concept testing, marketing and trend analysis, and consumer prototype testing.
    Management also believes the fragmented snacking category presents an opportunity for consolidation and the opportunity to build, through disciplined acquisitions, a leading platform in the nutritional snacking space. As a leader in nutritious snacking, management believes we have the unique capability to leverage our operating platform and customer relationships to expand beyond our current brands. Our experienced management team has deep expertise in brand building to expand the business into additional brands and products in the nutritional snacking segment. Simply Good Foods is actively seeking to identify and evaluate new acquisition opportunities to complement our existing portfolio, and sees significant opportunity for growth and synergies in complementary adjacent snacking categories such as sports/active and adult nutritional snacks, salty snacks and protein snacks, as well as in the “better-for-you” eating space. 
Intellectual Property
    We own numerous domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid if they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets are important to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system. We also own virtually all of the recipes and specifications to our products.
Competition
    We compete primarily with nutritional snacking brands in large retail and e-commerce environments. The nutritional snacking industry is fragmented and highly competitive and includes a number of diverse competitors. Our identified branded competitors include, but are not limited to, CLIF Bar, KIND bars, Special K, Boost, Slimfast, Muscle Milk, ONE bar, Pure Protein, Premier Nutrition and think!. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the nutritional snacking and weight management industries are:
•brand awareness and loyalty among consumers;
•ingredients;
•taste;
•low-carbohydrate, low-sugar, protein-rich versus other nutritional approaches;
•convenience;
•media spending;
•product variety and packaging; and
•access to retailer shelf space.
    We believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of these factors. However, a number of companies in the nutritional snacking and weight management industry have greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with distributors and suppliers, longer operating histories, greater distribution capabilities, stronger brand recognition, and greater marketing resources than we have.
Supply Chain
    We operate an asset-light business model. For the manufacture of our products, we subcontract with contract manufacturers, and as a result, our operations are highly flexible and require minimal capital expenditure. The supply chain for our international business also uses exclusively contract manufacturers.
    U.S. Supply Chain. The majority of our products are shipped directly to one central warehouse for the Atkins brand and one for the Quest brand, each of which is a leased warehouse managed by the same third-party logistics provider. We are in the process of combining most of our warehouse operations into a newly constructed larger warehouse facility. We intend to keep one of our original warehouses for a portion of our distribution needs. A substantial portion of our inventory is shipped directly to our retailers from these centers by the same third-party logistics provider. Most of our remaining customers pick-up their orders at our distribution centers and make their own arrangements for delivery to their fulfillment network. For certain customers, RTD shakes are shipped directly from the 
contract manufacturer to the customers’ locations. We believe our use of demand forecasting and vendor-managed inventory systems enables us to meet shipping demands, ensure timely delivery of orders and offer service levels to our customers.
    Sourcing. The principal ingredients to manufacture our products include chocolate and other coatings, dairy, proteins, soy, and nuts. Our packaging supplies consist of flexible film, cartons, tetra paper, and corrugate. All of our core ingredients are purchased according to rigorous standards to assure food quality and safety. These core ingredients are generally available in adequate quantities from several suppliers, and to date, core ingredient supplies have largely not been affected by the supply chain challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We competitively bid with major suppliers to source competitively priced, quality ingredients and packaging that meet our standards. For certain ingredients such as milk protein concentrate, whey proteins, chocolate coatings, some nuts, soy crisps, and liquid soy, we establish direct purchasing agreements with suppliers, under which our contract manufacturers source ingredients to produce finished products. We also actively manage the cost of our packaging needs, such as corrugated, film, printed boxes, and tetra cartons.
    Manufacturing. We rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. The contract manufacturers schedule and receive ingredient and packaging inventory according to parameters set in their contracts and forecasts we provide. As noted above, some ingredients and packaging are purchased by our contract manufacturers pursuant to framework contracts we have with the applicable suppliers. Our contract manufacturers are regularly audited by third parties and are required to follow rigorous food safety guidelines. We believe our contract manufacturers have capacity to meet our anticipated supply needs, although short-term high demand can cause disruptions. We monitor both near-term and long-term capacity as well as fulfillment rates and overall performance of our manufacturing partners and qualify alternate suppliers as needed. In general, we purchase finished products from our contract manufacturers, which includes all packaging and ingredients used, as well as an agreed-upon tolling charge for each item produced. These finished products are then shipped directly to our distribution centers, or shipped directly from the contract manufacturer to the customer, in the case of RTDs to select customers.
    U.S. Storage. We lease three distribution centers, all in Greenfield, Indiana, referred to collectively as the Distribution Centers, where we store finished goods. We utilize over 1.35 million square feet of floor space among our Distribution Centers. Over time, we expect to exit one of the currently operating Distribution Centers once the new facility is fully operational.
    Distribution. For the majority of our customers, our logistics provider distributes the finished goods via truckloads from our Distribution Centers, which first flow through regional terminals. At the terminals, our orders are consolidated with other companies’ products being shipped to the customer. The finished goods are then distributed to retailer distribution centers. The regular weekly shipments and consolidation have reduced our costs. For some products, we ship directly to customers from our contract manufacturer through a third-party logistics provider. In some instances, the customer will arrange to pick-up directly finished products from our Distribution Centers.
    Retailers. We have a wide variety of customers across the mass, food, club, drug, and e-commerce channels. A substantial majority of our sales are generated from a limited number of retailers. Sales to our largest retailer, Walmart, represented approximately 31% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2021, of which approximately 23% is through their mass retail channel and approximately 8% is through their Sam’s club and e-commerce channels. Sales to our next largest retailer, Amazon, represented approximately 12% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2021. No other customer represents more than 10% of sales. For additional information, please see the risk factor “We rely on sales to a limited number of retailers for a substantial majority of our net sales, and losing one or more such retailers may materially harm our business. In addition, we maintain “at will” contracts with these retailers, which do not require recurring or minimum purchase amounts of our products.”
    E-Commerce. We aim to ensure that our consumers may access our brand in the way that best suits their lifestyles by offering online ordering of our products. We sell our products on Atkins.com, questnutrition.com as well as Amazon.com, which all deliver our products directly to the location designated by the consumer.
    Food Safety and Quality. Food safety and quality is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that consumers receive safe, high quality food products. Our products are manufactured in facilities that have programs and controls in place regarding consistent quality and food safety. Product attributes such as taste, aroma, texture, and appearance are regularly monitored. Good Manufacturing Practices and comprehensive food safety programs are designed to produce a safe, wholesome product. Our suppliers are required to have equally robust processes in place and confirm their compliance with product specifications with Letters of Guaranty and Certificates of Analysis for shipments of core ingredients to be used in our products. Finally, random samples of finished goods are regularly sent to a third-party laboratory for testing.
    International. Our products are also sold outside North America. Our top international sales are in Australia and New Zealand. For the fifty-two weeks ended August 28, 2021, international net sales represented approximately 4.5% of total net sales. Our international supply chain is run by a lean team solely focused on international operations. Similar to U.S. operations, international operations utilize contract manufacturers for products, and distributors for distribution and sales.
Information Technology
    We rely heavily on information systems for management of our supply chain, inventory, payment of obligations, collection of cash, human capital management, financial tools and other business processes and procedures. Our ability to manage our business functions efficiently and effectively depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. We have instituted controls, including information technology governance controls that are intended to protect our computer systems and our information technology systems and networks. We also have business continuity plans that attempt to anticipate and mitigate failures. However, we cannot control or prevent every potential technology failure, adverse environmental event, third-party service interruption or cybersecurity risk.
    We increasingly rely on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer, consumer or employee information on our behalf.
    Except for limited information voluntarily submitted by users of our website, we typically do not collect or store consumer data or personal information. However, third-party providers, including our licensees, contract manufacturers, e-commerce contractors and third-party sellers may do so. The website operations of such third parties may be affected by reliance on other third-party hardware and software providers, technology changes, risks related to the failure of computer systems through which these website operations are conducted, telecommunications failures, data security breaches and similar disruptions.
Segments
    Our operations are organized into two operating segments, Atkins and Quest, which are aggregated into one reporting segment due to similar financial, economic and operating characteristics. The operating segments are also similar in the following areas: (a) the nature of the products; (b) the nature of the production processes; (c) the methods used to distribute products to customers, (d) the type of customer for the products, and (e) the nature of the regulatory environment.
Regulation and Compliance
    Along with contract manufacturers, brokers, distributors, ingredients and packaging suppliers, Simply Good Foods is primarily subject to laws and regulations in the United States promulgated by federal, state and local government authorities. In the United States, the federal agencies governing the manufacture, distribution and advertising of products include, among others, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, in addition to similar state and local agencies. Under various statutes, these agencies prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety and regulate marketing and advertising to consumers. In certain circumstances, these agencies must not only approve products, but also review the manufacturing processes and facilities used to produce these products before they can be marketed in the United States.
    Simply Good Foods is subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Our operations, and those of our contract manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers, also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters. We continue to monitor their development and our compliance.
Food-Related Regulations
    As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to several food-related regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States. The FDA:
•regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations;
•specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell; and
•prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels.
    We are subject to the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, which, among other things, mandates that the FDA adopt preventative controls to be implemented by food facilities in order to minimize or prevent hazards to food safety. We are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products.
    Additionally, because of the ingredients in our Quest pizza products we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the USDA, including the Federal Meat Inspection Act. The USDA regulates certain aspects of food safety, quality, and nutritional labeling of most meat, poultry, and egg products.
Environmental Regulations
    We are subject to various state and federal environmental laws, regulations and directives, including the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. Governments may in the future implement new laws, regulations and directives aimed to meet certain climate change goals and objectives which could affect our business operations as they relate to ingredient and packaging procurement.
    We believe that we are in material compliance with existing environmental regulations applicable to our business. We do not expect the cost of our continued compliance with existing environmental regulations to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, cash flows or competitive position in the foreseeable future. In addition, any asset retirement obligations are not material.
Labeling Regulations
    We are subject to various labeling requirements with respect to our products at the federal, state and local levels. At the federal level, the FDA and USDA have authority to review product labeling, and the FTC may review labeling and advertising materials, including online and television advertisements, to determine if advertising materials are misleading. We are also subject to various state and local consumer protection laws. We believe we are in material compliance with all labeling laws and regulations applicable to our business.
Human Capital Resources
    As of August 28, 2021, our workforce consisted of 263 employees who are largely based in an office or in research and development (“R&D”) lab locations. Of that total, approximately 91% of our employees were located in the United States, and the rest were located in Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Of our total employees, 118 employees were engaged in marketing and sales, 76 were engaged in R&D, operations and quality, and 69 were engaged in administration. Of our total employees, 18 employees were hourly and 245 were salaried. No employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
    Mission, Vision and Values. Our vision is to lead the nutritious snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient, innovative, great-tasting, better-for-you snacks and meal replacements. Our mission is to empower healthy lives through smart and satisfying nutrition. Our values, Act with Integrity, Lead with Innovation, Succeed through Interdependence, Be Empowered, and Bring Passion Every Day, are critical to our success in fulfilling our mission and vision.
    Training & Development. Training and development is critical to our mission’s success, helps our employees grow their career, and is one way we attract, motivate and retain our employees. We regularly host “Be Empowered” sessions for employees, which are educational classes and networking opportunities that teach our nutrition philosophy and our different business functions. To develop effective and empowered leaders, we host a series of trainings and informational sessions through our program called the Leadership Playbook.
    Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DE&I”). We recognize the importance of a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture for our employees and its effect on our ability to achieve our mission, so we have made commitments to track and improve our performance in each of these areas. In July 2021, our Board of Directors formed a Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability committee that has been tasked, among other things, with overseeing human capital resources and DE&I initiatives.
    As of August 28, 2021, approximately 53% of our employees globally were women and approximately 35% of U.S. employees were minorities. Approximately 17% of our Board of Directors were female, and approximately 8% were minorities.
    To improve diversity, equity and inclusion, we committed to interviewing diverse candidates for open corporate leadership positions and require every employee to attend preventing discrimination and harassment training.
    In January 2021 we completed a pay equity audit to confirm equity in our pay practices. We have committed to complete a pay equity audit every year to ensure no inequities arise. Further, we post every open position or promotional opportunity in the United States that is not confidential and include the job’s pay range to provide pay transparency. This practice provides every qualified candidate an opportunity to apply while also knowing the range of pay for the role.
    We regularly ask our employees to respond to pulse surveys to gather feedback on topics ranging from organization changes to overall engagement and inclusion. This allows us to keep track of employee engagement and sentiment over time and use this information to inform our strategy and actions to continue to grow and improve. We have also committed to summarizing results for each survey and providing responses quickly after surveys close.
    In August 2021, management hired a third-party DE&I consultant to provide guidance and best practice inputs to our management and the Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors, as we continue to make progress on our DE&I efforts.
    Total Rewards. The health, satisfaction and security of our employees and their families are important to us and an important part of reaching our organization's goals. We offer total rewards packages that include valuable and competitive compensation and benefit plans. These programs reflect our commitment to attracting and retaining top talent and keeping our staff healthy and secure. Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance, and we do so through a mix of base salary, annual short-term incentive and long-term incentive. 
    We understand that each employee's situation is unique, so we offer benefits that can be shaped and molded by each employee to fit their family's needs. Our current benefits vary by region, but generally include medical, dental and vision insurance, 401(k) retirement plan, savings accounts, life and disability coverage, and other voluntary benefits. We also offer time-off benefits including vacation time, flexible vacation for exempt positions, sick leave, and parental leave.
    Volunteering and Philanthropy. For decades, we have had a compelling social purpose – to help ensure all Americans have access to sound nutritional guidance to positively affect overall health outcomes. This began with the book Dr. Atkins’ Diet Revolution published in 1972 and continues today with our advocacy for improved dietary guidelines and initiatives to educate consumers and empower them to make the right nutritional choices for themselves and their families.
    Further, we do our part to stem food insecurity through volunteering opportunities and company philanthropy, including cash and product donations. We encourage our employees to volunteer, and as such have organized days of volunteering in the cities where our largest workforces reside. In Denver, Colorado our team volunteered for the Food Bank of the Rockies, and in El Segundo, California our team volunteered for the Los Angeles Mission.
    Also this year, we announced participation in Walmart’s “Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign. For each purchase of participating Simply Good Foods products at Walmart from April 5 – May 3, 2021, we donated the monetary equivalent of at least one meal to Feeding America. Through this program, Simply Good Foods secured at least 500,000 meals for Feeding America.
    Employee Safety and Wellbeing Measures. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as of August 28, 2021, we have implemented a number of measures to keep our employees safe:
•All office positions have been encouraged to work from home, and we will not require employees to return to the office until January 2022, at the earliest.
•In our offices and R&D labs where employees are required to physically access special tools or resources to work, we follow local, state and federal guidance by:
◦Requiring face coverings
◦Instituting social distancing guidelines
◦Requiring all employees to complete an online health screening daily
◦Increasing our deep-cleaning schedule
◦Making hand sanitizer readily available.
•We limit travel to only business-essential travel.
    Further, we also strongly encourage employees to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, so we offered an incentive and lottery once the vaccines were widely available to all adults in the United States. The portion of our employees who got the vaccine exceeded each of the local and state-level vaccination rates of the general population.
    We acknowledge the importance of balance in our employees’ lives to their overall wellbeing, so we offer our employees time off benefits described above to recharge. We also had two company-wide mental health days and encourage employees to take extra time away from work to recharge late December 2020. We adopted an employee-friendly parental leave policy in 2020.
    To address the fatigue that results from working on a computer from home all day, we implemented “Zoom-free” Wednesday afternoons so employees can step away from their computers to focus on other responsibilities. When we do return to our offices regularly, it is our current intention that Mondays and Fridays will be flexible remote workdays.
