ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on March 5, 2021, as a Delaware corporation whose business purpose is to effect a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination. We intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team and our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) to identify, acquire and operate businesses across a range of sectors that may provide opportunities for attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns.
 
On December 13, 2021, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 20,000,000 units (the “Units”), each Unit consisting of one share of Class A Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (each, a “Warrant”), each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, and the IPO generated gross proceeds of $200,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we completed the private sale of 9,560,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to the Company’s sponsor, at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $9,560,000. A total of $203,000,000, comprised of proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “Trust Account”) maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.
 
On January 6, 2022, BofA Securities Inc., the underwriter in the IPO, partially exercised its option to purchase additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, and purchased an additional 2,250,000 Units, generating gross proceeds of $22,500,000. As a result of the underwriter’s partial exercise of the over-allotment option, on January 6, 2022, our sponsor surrendered to us for cancellation 187,500 shares of our Class B Common Stock. Simultaneously with the closing of the over-allotment option, we consummated the private placement (the “Additional Private Placement” and, together with the Private Placement, the “Private Placements”) of an additional 787,500 Private Placement Warrants to our sponsor at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $787,500. On January 6, 2022, a total of $22,837,500 of the net proceeds from the closing of the over-allotment option and the Additional Private Placement were deposited into the Trust Account, resulting in a total deposit of $225,837,500 in the Trust Account since the Trust Account was established.
 
Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to us to pay our tax obligations (plus up to $100,000 interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (a) the completion of our initial business combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A Common Stock the right to have their shares redeemed or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 13, 2023 (or September 13, 2023 if our sponsor exercises its extension option), or (ii) with respect to any other material provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (c) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination by June 13, 2023 (or September 13, 2023 if our sponsor exercises its extension option), subject to applicable law. The proceeds held in the Trust Account may only be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).
 


 
While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector, given the operational experience of our management team in the healthcare services sector, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on key trends and opportunities in the post-COVID-19 world of healthcare. Members of our management team and Board of Directors have extensive experience in the space, including acting as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, Administrator under President Obama and CEO of one of the largest healthcare staffing firms in the U.S. (based on 2019 revenue). Several of them have served on the boards of influential and innovative healthcare companies, such as Innovage Holding Corp., Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) and Select Medical Holdings Corporation, and our Chairman has a deep understanding of government funding of healthcare from his time as Governor of Florida. We intend to acquire and manage a business or businesses in the healthcare services industry that can benefit from our differentiated and extensive relationships, strength of the Jackson brand name in the healthcare services space and national network.
 
The healthcare services industry represents a large and growing market with strong secular tailwinds and a broad range of potential business combination targets. According to CMS, total U.S. healthcare expenditures reached approximately $3.8 trillion in 2019, up from approximately $2.8 trillion in 2012. CMS has projected that these expenditures will grow at an average annual rate of approximately 5.4% from 2019 through 2028 and reach approximately $6.2 trillion in 2028, and has estimated that total U.S. healthcare spending will constitute approximately 20% of projected U.S. gross domestic product in 2028. We believe that the healthcare services industry will continue to grow significantly due to, among other things, the increased use of innovative technologies designed to improve patient outcomes, drive efficiency in the industry and permit healthcare companies to better control costs while improving access and overall quality of healthcare.
 
We believe that, in recent years, private healthcare services companies have not had easy access to the U.S. initial public offering (“IPO”) markets. Due to this limited access, we believe that private healthcare services companies have had to rely to a significant extent upon private financing from investors and bank financing to fund their businesses. Moreover, the traditional IPO process is relatively lengthy, requires the commitment of significant time and resources, and is subject to the risk that the transaction may not be completed at a favorable offering price, or at all. By contrast, management and owners of healthcare services companies may consider that the sale of their business or other business combination involves a more efficient process and offers greater certainty of outcome than an IPO. We believe a special purpose acquisition company such as ours is well positioned to provide the benefit of a public listing to such companies.
 
In light of these market conditions, we intend to primarily focus our target sourcing efforts on private healthcare services companies that we believe would benefit from a public listing and that are not otherwise gaining access to public capital. Furthermore, we believe that our management team is positioned to drive ongoing value creation in a post-combination business, as our team has done with other investments in the healthcare services sectors over time. We believe our management team is well suited to identify opportunities that have the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders.
 
Industry Opportunity
 
While we may acquire a business in any industry and geographic area, we focus on industries that complement our management team’s background and capitalize on their ability to identify and acquire a business specializing in healthcare services, healthcare technology or otherwise focused on the healthcare industry in the United States. Given our team’s extensive experience in the healthcare services sector, we believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the key trends and opportunities in the post-COVID-19 world of healthcare. We believe the healthcare services industry is uniquely attractive for a number of reasons:

• | Large and Growing Market Opportunity. We believe that the healthcare services industry represents a significant market opportunity. According to CMS, total U.S. healthcare expenditures reached approximately $3.8 trillion in 2019, and CMS has estimated that total U.S. healthcare spending will constitute approximately 20% of projected U.S. gross domestic product in 2028. We believe the current trajectories of healthcare spending will encourage the development of new technologies and present valuable opportunities for growth in the healthcare space. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Shift from Volume-Based care to Value-Based Care. In traditional volume-based care, or fee-for-service, healthcare providers are reimbursed for the number of services ordered. In these models, neither quality of care nor necessity of individual services (tests, procedures, etc.) are emphasized. The recent shift to performance-based care, or a more holistic approach to treatment, is intended to enhance cost efficiency while holding providers accountable for the quality of services they offer through risk-sharing models. This change is expected to significantly alter the dynamics of the U.S. healthcare system and to create opportunities for businesses to enter the healthcare space and make a difference in patient care. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accelerating Shift of Care to Lower Cost Settings. There has been a significant shift toward alternative sites and consumer convenience in recent years. We expect to continue to see an increased volume mix to outpatient care, particularly in lower-cost sites outside of the hospital as consumers gravitate to retail-friendly models and lower out-of-pocket costs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Macro Trends. Total U.S. healthcare expenditures are projected to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 5.4% from 2019 through 2028, according to CMS. Explanatory factors for this projected growth include an aging population, increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and improved access to healthcare products and services. This projected growth trajectory has put significant pressure on payors, which suggests favorable trends for healthcare companies that can control costs while improving access and overall quality of healthcare. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased Emphasis Due to COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the attention paid to the U.S. healthcare system. Public and private entities are placing an increasing emphasis on the resilience and stability of the system, in particular shortening supply chains, reducing reliance on offshore suppliers, and improving reliability and efficiency. We expect this dynamic to favor domestic companies that can reduce cost and improve quality of and access to care. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Technological Advances and Spread of Social Media. Recent years have seen great advances in electronic healthcare services (e.g., electronic medical records, telehealth, awareness of mental health on social media, etc.). Combined with shifts in the methods of healthcare delivery in the U.S. (e.g., value-based care), we believe that there are attractive opportunities for development of flagship products or services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Gaps in Access, Quality and Affordability of Healthcare. Despite healthcare reform designed to make health insurance accessible to a broader range of the U.S. population, we believe that significant healthcare disparities have persisted and, in some cases, widened. Our management team is committed to closing these gaps and believes that it requires ongoing technological innovation, increasing attention towards the social determinants of health, and continued cost containment in addition to public policy actions and fiscal support. These challenging dynamics are expected to continue to put pressure on healthcare services companies to act with speed, creativity and resilience-and reward those that can do so-regardless of the regulatory or political environment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 


 
  We believe the healthcare services industry has a number of unique and attractive sectors that have lately been showing favorable business dynamics:
 

• | Risk-Based Providers and Services. The increasing cost of care has prompted a transition to value-based care models that are designed to reduce unnecessary healthcare spending. CMS estimates that total U.S. healthcare spending in 2019 was approximately $3.8 trillion. A report published by JAMA Network in 2019 estimated that approximately one-quarter of all U.S. healthcare spending was due to healthcare waste, including unnecessary services, excessive administrative costs and fraud. We believe that this creates a market opportunity for provider organizations that engage in capitated models designed to share in the risk associated with the healthcare costs of their underlying patient population. There has also been an increased emphasis on provider training and continuing education. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Alternate Site Healthcare Provider and Services. Rising healthcare expenditures are prompting industry players to transition to less expensive care settings. Hospitals, clinics and other traditional care sites are seeking to reduce expenses and launch value-based care initiatives, including a shift to outpatient and retail care sites, such as urgent care clinics and ambulatory surgical centers. Enhanced by digital health innovations and technologies, we expect such alternate site healthcare providers to drive the integration of the industry and to reduce the overall cost of healthcare. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Home Care and Hospices. The elderly population of the U.S. continues to grow, resulting in an ongoing need for long-term care. We believe that many elderly patients now prefer the home care model to traditional hospitals. In addition, technology advances are expected to improve care delivery, enabling better patient care in a home environment and saving costly hospital spending. Despite the sector being very fragmented, home care is projected to be one of the two fastest growing sectors of the U.S. healthcare economy, and the fifth fastest growing industry in the U.S. economy generally, based on projected net growth in employment from 2019 through 2029, according to 2020 data appearing on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ “The Economics Daily” website. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Behavioral Health. According to a 2018 survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, approximately one out of five adults in the U.S. experiences a mental health disorder, yet only approximately 45% of those adults receive treatment. We believe that the rise of telehealth in the last few years and the general industry shift to alternate health sites have increased patients’ access to and the overall usage of behavioral health treatments.

Business Strategy and Competitive Strengths
 
Our goal is to complete a business combination with a company that is fundamentally healthy and then to work with that company to access the capital markets, attract experienced management talent, and execute a proprietary value-creation business plan, designed to help the company to grow into the next phase of its life cycle. We plan to focus on identifying acquisition candidates to leverage our management’s deep experience in the integration and coordination of healthcare services, as well as to capitalize on the current healthcare trends and valuation dislocation. We plan to employ a fundamental, value-oriented acquisition framework that seeks a target with the potential for significant equity value creation coupled with strong downside protection from dependable cash flows and a durable business franchise. Our management team along with our Board of Directors have experience in:

• | operating companies in the public and private markets, defining corporate strategy, and identifying, mentoring and recruiting leading talent, and identifying and executing on operational improvements that drive value; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | growing companies, both organically and through strategic transactions, expanding product portfolios and broadening geographic footprints;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | building strong sales networks to drive organic growth across market segments, targeting a wide range of payor and referral sources, with a focus on compliance and customer service across all parties in the care delivery and reimbursement chain; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strategically investing in leading private and public healthcare and other companies to help accelerate growth and maturation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | sourcing, structuring, acquiring and selling businesses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | accessing public and private capital markets to optimize capital structure, including financing businesses and helping companies transition ownership structures; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fostering relationships with sellers, capital providers and experienced target management teams.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Members of our team and our sponsor have begun the search for a target business by communicating with their network of relationships and other interested parties. While we have engaged in discussions with multiple potential targets, as of the date hereof we have not entered into a definitive agreement with respect to an initial business combination.
 
Acquisition Strategy and Criteria
 
Our acquisition strategy is designed to leverage the network of multi-disciplined healthcare and related experience, which includes leading acute, post-acute and multi-site healthcare services companies, built up by members of our management team over their careers. Additionally, we expect that relationships cultivated from years of transaction experience with management teams of public and private companies, investment bankers, restructuring advisers, attorneys and accountants will provide potential opportunities for the company.
 
Although our management team has extensive experience in the healthcare industry, we will not restrict our proposition search to this field. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team and Board of Directors have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will be useful for sourcing investment opportunities.
 
We plan to focus our search on companies that have many or all of the following characteristics, although we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target that falls outside of these categories:
 

• | Industry Attractiveness. Macro industry dynamics, including the healthcare regulatory and reimbursement situation, must be favorable on a go-forward basis. Healthcare companies can utilize the extensive networks and insights that members of our management team have built in the sector to drive meaningful operational improvements and efficiency gains or to enhance their strategic position by using technology solutions to differentiate its offering. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Management Team. We will seek to acquire businesses or companies with seasoned and strong management teams. Our team brings a breadth of knowledge and plans to focus on assets that represent the same values, proven track records, and work ethic. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growth Potential. We will seek to target propositions with significant growth potential with the addition of our management team and resources. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Value Proposition. We will seek businesses or companies with clear value proposition, including how success will be measured and demonstrated to investors and that we believe are positioned to provide attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our stockholders. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Benefit from Access to Public Investors. We will seek to target companies that are ready to become public, with strong management, corporate governance and reporting policies in place, and which we believe will likely be well received by public investors and are expected to have good access to the public capital markets. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The criteria listed above are not an exhaustive list. The above guidelines are meant to guide management in acquisition searches and compare qualities of considered businesses. However, we may choose to engage a target business that does not meet these criteria or guidelines.
 
Our Acquisition Process
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which is expected to encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience.
 


 
The rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) require that our initial business combination be with one or more operating businesses or assets with an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding deferred underwriting discounts) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our Board of Directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our Board of Directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our Board of Directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to the NYSE rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
 
Redemption Rights
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein.
 
The amount in the Trust Account was initially anticipated to be $10.15 per public share and is approximately $10.29 per public share as of December 31, 2022. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriter. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our sponsor, directors and officers have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
 


 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (other than in a public offering for cash; or in a private financing for cash at a price that meets certain NYSE requirements) or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we and our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our shares of common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions upon the completion of our initial business combination, or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will:
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

Submission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Stockholder Vote
 
If we seek stockholder approval, unless otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of our initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Shares held by our initial stockholders, officers and directors will be included in determining the presence of a quorum and have agreed to vote any founder shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our initial business combination.
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those stockholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering) for or against our initial business combination.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we have only until June 13, 2023 (or September 13, 2023 if the sponsor exercises its extension option) to complete our initial business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination by June 13, 2023 (or by September 13, 2023 if the sponsor exercises its extension option) or during an extended period of time resulting from an amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation as a result of a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (any such extended period of time, a “Charter Extension Period”), we will (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any); and (3) dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 18-month time period (or 21-month time period if the sponsor exercises its extension option) or during any Charter Extension Period.

Status as a Public Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) our annual revenues equals or exceeds $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
 
We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer target businesses an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses may find this method a more certain and cost-effective means to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering.
 
Once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It may also offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 


 
Competition
 
We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, in the event we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we are obligated to pay cash for shares of our Class A Common Stock, it will potentially reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination within the required time period, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.15 per share, or less in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless.
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 2655 Northwinds Parkway, Alpharetta, GA 30009. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee that we pay an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. In addition, we may have officers that do not work from our designated facilities due to telecommuting. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
 
We currently have two officers, Mr. Richard L. Jackson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Douglas B. Kline, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
