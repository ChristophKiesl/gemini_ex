Item 1. Business. 
Our Company
 Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc. (“Radius” or the “Company”) is a holding company with no material assets other than cash and its limited liability company interests in APW OpCo LLC (“APW OpCo”), a Delaware limited liability company and the sole limited partner of AP WIP Investments Holdings, LP (“AP Wireless”), which in turn is the direct parent of AP WIP Investments, LLC (“AP WIP Investments” and collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “APW Group”). Radius was incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands on November 1, 2017, then known as Landscape Acquisition Holdings Limited (“Landscape”), which was formed to undertake an acquisition of a target company or business. On November 20, 2017, the ordinary shares (the “Ordinary Shares”) and warrants to purchase Ordinary Shares (the “Warrants”) of Landscape were admitted to listing on the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”), and Landscape raised approximately $500 million before expenses through its initial placement of 48,400,000 Ordinary Shares and the Warrants on November 20, 2017 and a private subscription by Noam Gottesman and Michael D. Fascitelli for 1,600,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company designated as “Series A Founder Preferred Stock” (the “Series A Founder Preferred Stock”). 
 On February 10, 2020 (the “Closing Date”), Landscape completed the acquisition of the APW Group from Associated Partners, LP, a Guernsey limited partnership (“Associated Partners”) and was renamed Digital Landscape Group, Inc. On October 2, 2020, the Company effected a discontinuance under Section 184 of the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004, as amended, and a domestication under Section 388 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, pursuant to which the Company’s jurisdiction of incorporation was changed from the British Virgin Islands to the State of Delaware (the “Domestication”). Effective upon the Domestication, the Company was renamed “Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc.” On October 2, 2020, in connection with the Domestication, the Company delisted its Ordinary Shares and Warrants from trading on the LSE and on October 5, 2020 began trading its shares of shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Class A Common Stock” or “Class A Shares”) on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “RADI”.
 For more information relating to the acquisition of the APW Group, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments—The APW Acquisition”. Except as the context otherwise requires, references in the following discussion to the “Company”, “Radius”, “we”, “our” or “us” with respect to periods prior to the Closing Date are to our “Predecessor”, the APW Group, and its operations prior to the Closing Date; such references with respect to periods after to the Closing Date are to our “Successor”, Radius Global Infrastructure, Inc. and its subsidiaries (including the APW Group), and their operations after the Closing Date.
 The APW Group was established as a U.S. cell site lease aggregator in 2010 and made its first foreign lease investment in November of 2011. As of December 31, 2021, the APW Group held assets in, a total of 19 jurisdictions in addition to the U.S. We believe that the APW Group has been a “first mover” in many of these jurisdictions; that is, until its market entry no other parties were engaged in the systematic aggregation of cell site leases in any kind of scale.
 Our Business
 Through our ownership of the APW Group, we are one of the largest international aggregators of rental streams underlying wireless and other essential communications infrastructure sites through the acquisition of real property interests and contractual rights. We purchase, primarily for a lump sum, the right to receive future rental payments generated pursuant to an existing ground, rooftop or other communications infrastructure lease (and any subsequent lease or extension or amendment thereof) between a property owner and an owner of a wireless tower, antennae or other essential communications infrastructure (each such lease, a “Tenant Lease”). Typically, we acquire the rental streams by way of a purchase of a real property interest in the land underlying the wireless tower, antennae or other essential communications infrastructure, most commonly easements, usufructs, leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, or fee simple interests, each of which provide us with the right to receive all communications rents relating to the property, including the rents from the Tenant Lease. In addition, we purchase contractual interests, such as an assignment of rents, either in conjunction with the property interest or as a stand-alone right.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had interests in 8,186 and 7,189 leases that generate rents for us, respectively. These leases related to properties that were situated on 6,211 and 5,427 different communications sites, respectively, throughout the United States and 19 other countries. Our revenue was $103.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, annualized contractual revenue from the rents expected to be collected on the leases we had in place at that time (the annualized “in-place rents”) from the APW Group assets was approximately $117.9 million. For a definition of annualized in-place rents and a comparison to the most directly comparable financial measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), revenue, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.
 We believe that our business model and the nature of our assets provides us with stable, predictable and growing cash flow. First, we seek to acquire real property interests and rental streams subject to triple net or effectively triple net lease arrangements, whereby most taxes, utilities, maintenance costs and insurance are the responsibility of either the owner of the communications infrastructure or the property owner. Furthermore, Tenant Leases contain contractual rent increase clauses, or “rent escalators”, that are tied to a local consumer price index (“CPI”), subject to open market valuation (“OMV”) or at a fixed rate of increase, typically at approximately 3%. As a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as a percentage of annualized in-place rents as of December 31, 2021, approximately 98% of our Tenant Leases had contractual rent escalators. Approximately 76% (as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021) and 78% (as a percentage of annualized in-place rents as of December 31, 2021) of our Tenant Lease contractual rent escalators were either tied to a local CPI or subject to OMV, and the remainder were fixed escalators. In addition, the APW Group has historically experienced low annual churn as a percentage of revenue, ranging from 1% to 2%, primarily due to the significant network challenges and expenses incurred by owners of communications infrastructure in connection with the relocation of these infrastructure assets to alternative sites. Finally, we seek to obtain the ability to negotiate amendments and renewals of our Tenant Leases, thereby providing us with additional recurring revenue and one-time fees.
 Our Strategy
 We seek to continually expand our business primarily by implementing organic growth strategies, including expanding into different geographies, asset classes and technologies; continued acquisition of real estate interests and contractual rights (as well as other revenue streams) supporting wireless communications sites and other communications infrastructure (as well as through annual rent escalators, the addition of new tenants and/or lease modifications); and developing a portfolio of infrastructure assets including through acquisition or build to suit. We intend to achieve these objectives by executing the following strategies:
 Growing Through Additional Acquisitions. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of real property interests and contractual rights underlying communications infrastructure, utilizing the expertise of our management and our proven, proprietary underwriting process to identify and assess potential acquisitions. When acquiring real property interests and contractual rights, we aim to target communications infrastructure locations that are essential to the ongoing operations and profitability of the respective tenants, which we expect will result in continued high tenant occupancy and cash flow stability. We have established a local presence in high opportunity countries in order to expand our operating jurisdictions. In addition, we can utilize our advanced acquisition expertise to pursue acquisitions and investments in either single assets or portfolios of assets.
 Increasing Cash Flow Without Additional Capital Investment. We seek to organically grow our cash flow on our existing portfolio without additional capital investment through (i) contractual rent escalations, (ii) lease renewals, at higher rates, with existing tenants, (iii) rent increases based on equipment, technology or site modification upgrades at our infrastructure locations and (iv) the addition of new tenants to existing locations.
 Leveraging Existing Platform and Continued Expansion of our Business into the Broader Communications Infrastructure. We have acquired additional like-kind, long-dated rental streams within the communications infrastructure market segment that have similar characteristics to our core “Tenant Lease” (i.e., an existing lease between a property owner and an owner of a wireless tower or antenna), including investing in Tenant Leases underneath (i) mobile switching centers, which are digital communication fiber exchanges that make the connection between mobile users within networks, from mobile users to the public switched telephone network, and from mobile users to other mobile networks, (ii) distributed antenna system (DAS) networks, which are a way to address isolated 
 2

spots of poor coverage in a large building or facility (such as a hospital or transportation hub) by installing networks of small antennae to serve as repeaters, (iii) build-to suit-opportunities where we are contracted to build communications infrastructure (such as wireless towers) and lease such equipment to tenants on a long-term basis, and (iv) data centers, which are large groups of networked computer servers typically used by organizations for remote storage, processing or distribution of large amounts of data that are typically located in a stand-alone building. Additionally, Cell:cm Chartered Surveyors, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary within the APW Group, offers building consultancy services including architecture and design, building and roof maintenance, building surveys and development, and project monitoring.
 Our Assets
 Types of Assets
 As of December 31, 2021, we have acquired a total of 8,506 leases since the inception of the APW Group in 2010 (including non-renewed or terminated leases). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had interests in 8,186 and 7,189 leases that generate rents for us, respectively. These outstanding leases related to properties that were situated on 6,211 and 5,427 different communications sites, respectively. Each of these “assets” is the right to receive the rent payable under the Tenant Lease entered into between the property owner or current lessor of the property and the owner of the wireless communication towers, antennae or other assets installed at such site. These tenants typically are either wireless carriers (mobile network operators, or “MNOs”) or tower companies. We acquire these interests primarily through individually negotiated transactions with the property owners. Our revenue growth rate has historically ranged from approximately 3% to 4.5%, and approximately 1% to 2% of our leases are lost annually due to non-renewal or terminations.
 The majority of these assets are real property interests of varying legal structures (such as easements, usufructs, leases, surface rights or fee simple interests), which provide us the right to receive the income from the Tenant Lease rental payments over a specified duration. The real property right granted to us is typically limited to the land underlying the area of the communication asset. However, in certain circumstances we purchase interest in a larger portion of the real property. For rooftop interests, we typically create an interest in the entire rooftop rather than just the portion of the rooftop underlying an antenna, to permit it to grant additional rights to new or existing tower or antenna operators. The scope of the real property interest is also typically tied to our use for wireless communication assets. We also purchase contractual rights in the rental stream, such as through an assignment of rents, either individually or in connection with the purchase of the real property right.
 As set forth in the table below, approximately 91% and 94% of the total portfolio was generated from real property interests (including fee simple interests), based on total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and annualized in-place rents as of December 31, 2021, respectively, and 6% was generated from contractual property interests, based on total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and annualized in-place rents as of December 31, 2021, respectively. For a definition of annualized in-place rents and a comparison to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, revenue, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Non-GAAP Financial Measures”. Our revenue was $103.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Real Property Interests. As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of 6,858 leases arising from real property interests, other than fee simple interests. These real property interests vary by jurisdiction and often bifurcate portions of ownership. In the U.S., the real property interests are generally easements. In the United Kingdom, we typically enter into “head leases” with the property owner or leaseholder which, as a matter of law, inserts us between the property owner or leaseholder and the tenant. In other jurisdictions, we may purchase from the property owners (i) a “usufruct”, which is a real property right that provides us with the ability to benefit from a property arising from the specified use (in this case use for wireless communications services) for a specified duration or (ii) a “surface right”, which is a real property right to benefit from and use the surface of a property for a specified duration. Under a usufruct or surface right, we become, in accordance with local law, the legal beneficiary of any leases pre-existing on such property and typically have the right to negotiate any new leases during the specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the full property rights again are vested in the property owner. In each case, these real property rights are registered with the property registry in the applicable jurisdiction to provide constructive notice of such interests and to protect against subsequent creditors.
 As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate 1,328 assets associated with fee simple interests. These assets were primarily held in the United Kingdom (690), Italy (88), the United States (61) and the Netherlands (56). Fee simple ownership confers the greatest bundle of property rights available to us in any jurisdiction. The size of fee simple holdings is typically limited to the land underlying or other real property containing the communication structure and, in certain cases, the surrounding areas for ancillary structures. When we hold a fee simple interest, we will enter into a Tenant Lease directly with the tower owner (the MNO or tower company). In most of our fee simple interests, we have entered into a Tenant Lease that imposes on the tenant the responsibility for taxes, insurance, maintenance and utilities for such property.
 Contractual Rights. In addition to real property rights, we acquire contractual rights by way of an assignment of rents, typically where legal limitations of local real estate law or commercial circumstances make the acquisition of a real property interest impractical. These assignments of rent also arise with rooftops where the building is owned by a condominium or governmental entity and it is not feasible to obtain a real property interest. The rent assignment is a contractual obligation pursuant to which the property owner assigns its right to receive the rent arising under the Tenant Lease to us. A rent assignment relates only to an existing Tenant Lease and therefore would not provide us with the ability automatically to benefit from lease renewals beyond those provided for in the existing Tenant Lease. However, in these cases, we either limit the purchase price of the asset to the term of the current Tenant Lease or obtain an irrevocable power of attorney from the property owner that provides us with the ability to negotiate future leases and a contractual obligation from the property owner to assign rental streams from future Tenant Lease renewals.
Common Asset Attributes
 Non-disturbance Agreements. When we acquire a real property interest in connection with a property subject to a mortgage, we usually also enter into a non-disturbance agreement (or local equivalent) with the mortgage lender in order to protect us from potential foreclosure on the property owner at the infrastructure location, which foreclosure could, absent a non-disturbance agreement (or local equivalent), extinguish our real property interest. In some instances where we obtain non-disturbance agreements, we remain subordinated to some indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, substantially all of our real property interests were either subject to non-disturbance agreements or had been otherwise recorded in local real estate records in senior positions to any mortgages.
 Revenue Sharing. In most jurisdictions, the instruments granting us the real property interests or contractual rights often contain revenue sharing arrangements with property owners. These revenue sharing arrangements have varying structures and terms, but generally provide that, upon an increase in the rent due under a new Tenant Lease, the existing lease or a renewal of such lease, the property owner is entitled to receive a percentage of the additional rent payments. These revenue sharing amounts are individually negotiated and range from 20% to 50%.
 Triple Net Nature of the Assets. Through the acquisition of real property interests and contractual rights from the property owner, we obtain the property owner’s rights to the rental streams payable under the Tenant Lease. Generally, we do not assume, and contract back to the property owner, the obligations under the pre-existing Tenant Lease, such as the obligations to provide quiet enjoyment of the property or to pay property taxes. Typically, our assets are subject to triple net or effectively triple net lease arrangements, meaning that the tenants or the underlying property owners are contractually responsible for property level operating expenses, including taxes, utilities, maintenance capital and 
 4

operating expenditures and insurance. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, our property taxes, utilities, maintenance and insurance expenses were approximately 2% of revenue. We believe that our triple net and effectively triple net lease arrangements support a stable, consistent and predictable cash flow profile due to the following characteristics:
  
• | limited equipment maintenance costs or obligations;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | limited property level maintenance capital expenditures; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | limited property tax, utilities, or insurance obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 Assets with triple net lease arrangements represented 70% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 65% of annualized in-place rents as of December 31, 2021. For a definition of annualized in-place rents and a comparison to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, revenue, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.
 Asset Terms. The terms of our real property interests, other than our fee simple interests, generally range from 30 years to 99 years, although some are shorter, and provide us with the right to receive the future income from the future Tenant Lease rental payments over a specified duration. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average remaining term of our real property interests was 59.8 years and specifically, 56.3 years for our interests in the United States and Canada, 67.9 years for our interests in Europe and Australia and 27.6 years for our interests in South America and Mexico. In most cases, the stated term of the real property interest is longer than the remaining term of the Tenant Lease, which provides us with the right and opportunity for renewals and extensions. For more information regarding the terms of our Tenant Leases, see “Item 1. Business- Tenant Lease Terms”.  The table below provides an overview of the remaining term under our real property interests and contractual rights as of December 31, 2021.

Communication Structures. Our real property interests and contractual rights typically underlie either a wireless communications tower, an antenna or a fiber exchange. Our structure types include rooftop sites, wireless towers (including monopoles, self-supporting towers, stealth towers and guyed towers) and other structures (including, for example, fiber exchanges, water towers and church steeples) on which wireless communications assets are located. The table below provides an overview of our portfolio of assets by structure type. For a definition of annualized in-place rents and a comparison to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, revenue, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.

Before entering into a new geographic market, we evaluate numerous factors, including the following: (i) political stability, (ii) the rule of law, including the ability to obtain judicial enforcement of our property rights and contract rights, (iii) the reliability, quality, and accessibility of local property registries, (iv) macro-economic fundamentals, including inflation and exchange rates, (v) the ability to raise reasonably priced debt at appropriate leverage multiples to support local acquisitions, (vi) the total addressable market, (vii) taxes, including transfer and/or recordation taxes and indirect taxes such as VAT, (viii) regulatory issues, if any, (ix) the extent of competition in and the maturity of the wireless communications market, (x) consolidation risk among tower companies and MNOs, (xi) the potential for sale-leasebacks and/or lease-leasebacks between MNOs and tower companies, (xii) passive and active network sharing risk between MNOs, (xiii) the nature and creditworthiness of the local tower companies and/or MNOs, (xiv) our relationships with local tower companies and MNOs in the market based on our operations in other markets, and (xv) the overall cultural compatibility with the target jurisdiction in question.
 Tenant Base
 The counterparties to the Tenant Leases from which we derive our revenue are generally either large, investment-grade MNOs or tower companies that have a national or international footprint. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our top 20 tenants comprised 83% of our revenue. As of December 31, 2021, our top 20 tenants represented 86% of our annualized in-place rents. Investment-grade tenants, which include AT&T Mobility, Verizon, Telefónica, Orange, Telstra and Vodafone in the wireless carrier industry and American Tower, Crown Castle and Vantage Towers in the cellular tower industry, constituted 68% of the revenue of our top 20 customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our top five tenants generated approximately 47% of our revenue, and, as of December 31, 2021, generated 
 7

approximately 52% of our annualized in-place rents. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2021, investment-grade tenants comprised approximately 56% of total revenue. For a definition of annualized in-place rents and a comparison to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, revenue, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Non-GAAP Financial Measures”.
 Our property rights enable us to benefit from the high renewal rates experienced in the industry. Based on the technical challenges and significant expense associated with the decommissioning and repositioning of existing infrastructure within a MNO’s network, and the potential adverse effect on the MNO’s network quality and coverage, churn in the industry has historically been low. Furthermore, zoning restrictions in many countries typically significantly delay, hinder or prevent the construction of new sites, thereby limiting the alternatives available to MNOs. In addition, as MNOs seek to expand network coverage, we expect that MNOs will seek to deploy additional antennae through co-location on existing towers and rooftops, positioning us to benefit from additional revenue opportunities on many of the towers and other structures located on sites where we hold real property interests. We believe each of these attributes helps us achieve stable, consistent and predictable cash flow.
 We monitor tenant credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing, where available, the publicly filed financial reports, press releases and other publicly available industry information regarding the parent entities of tenants.
 Tenant Lease Terms
 The Tenant Leases underlying our assets are typically structured with automatically renewable periodic terms. Tenant Leases, as originally entered into with the property owners and classified as operating leases, typically have initial stated terms of five years, with multiple five-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. As of December 31, 2021, the average remaining lease term of our Tenant Leases is approximately nine years including renewal terms. Our Tenant Leases produce an average of approximately $1,200 per month in rental payments but can range above and below that significantly. In addition, substantially all of our Tenant Leases include built in rent escalators, which are typically CPI increases, OMV increases or are at a fixed percentage of approximately 3%, and increase rent annually or on the renewal of the lease term. As a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and as a percentage of annualized in-place rents as of December 31, 2021, approximately 98% of our Tenant Leases had contractual rent escalators. Approximately 76% (as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021) and 78% (as a percentage of annualized in-place rents as of December 31, 2021) of our Tenant Lease contractual rent escalators were either tied to a local CPI or subject to OMV, and the remainder were fixed escalators. The table below sets forth our contractual rent escalators as of December 31, 2021, including as a percentage of revenue and as a percentage of annualized in-place rents.

Our Acquisition and Origination Platform
 We have developed experienced and proprietary techniques associated with (i) market targeting and evaluation, (ii) jurisdiction-specific structuring from legal, financial and tax perspectives, (iii) jurisdiction-specific documentation, (iv) asset identification, targeting and evaluation (including the construction, operation and maintenance of proprietary databases), (v) culturally appropriate marketing and acquisition techniques, (vi) jurisdiction-specific commercial and legal due diligence, (vii) relationships with more than 50 investment-grade MNOs and tower companies world-wide, (viii) ongoing relationships with regional and local financial, legal and tax advisors who are familiar with our business, (ix) relationships with local notaries in civil law countries, and (x) jurisdiction-specific property management and human resources practices.
 Our global real estate acquisition and property management platform consists of four phases: (1) lead generation and marketing, (2) investment origination, (3) underwriting and closing and (4) property management.
 9

Lead Generation
 We have developed a proprietary lead generation system, which we use across the jurisdictions in which we operate. This system is based on each jurisdiction’s local language and is used to identify asset prospects. Once an infrastructure location prospect has been identified, our global data management team leverages a variety of publicly available data and proprietary data and resources to obtain contact information for the property owner. Once the property owner’s address and contact information are verified, a “lead” is created in our proprietary customer relationship management database and made available to our local teams.
Investment Origination
 The investment origination process begins with a material interaction between one of our acquisitions professionals and the property owner, at which point a lead becomes an investment “opportunity.” Depending on the jurisdiction, initial interactions are either telephonic or in person. In most cases our personnel will physically meet with the property owner one or more times prior to closing. During this process we will evaluate the transaction alternatives and the property owner’s interest level in transacting with us. Once we obtain a copy of the lease from the property owner, relevant data is entered into our proprietary asset evaluation system to generate an initial term sheet or option agreement. Terms then are negotiated with the property owner and, upon acceptance of a term sheet or option agreement, we proceed with further diligence.
Underwriting and Closing
 After the proposal has been accepted by the property owner and a term sheet or option agreement has been executed, the investment opportunity moves to our underwriting and closing teams. The potential transaction enters a comprehensive due diligence process. Curative measures are taken to clear title on the real property interest during the underwriting and due diligence process.
 In the underwriting stage, we review various transaction-related material, documents and other information for compliance with our underwriting criteria.
 As a general matter, when acquiring real property interests, we will target infrastructure locations that are material to the operations of the existing tenants. The majority of our acquisitions include leases with investment-grade tenants or tenants whose sub-tenants are investment-grade companies. Additionally, we will focus on infrastructure locations with characteristics that are difficult to replicate in the respective market, and those with tenant assets that cannot be easily moved to alternative sites or replaced by new construction.
 While we typically make a single upfront payment in exchange for the revenue stream, the underwriting process also provides for the option to structure our payments to the property owner over a period of time, typically paying over a 2- to 7-year period (as opposed to 100% upfront). As of December 31, 2021, the weighted average remaining contractual payment term for our liabilities to property owners was 3.2 years.
 Once an opportunity is deemed to meet due diligence and underwriting standards, it proceeds to our investment committee for transaction approval. Pending approval, legal closing documents are prepared, executed and delivered.
 Property Management
 After funding, the tenant is notified of the transaction and a notarized payment re-direction letter is sent advising the tenant to redirect rental payments to us. The asset management phase includes collections, tenant payment conversion, tenant contact management, the negotiation of lease renewals, modifications, cancellations, reductions, document and consent requests, landlord and tenant complaints and new leasing of available tenant sites. The objective of the asset management function is to ensure that we efficiently receive and process our rental income while optimizing our ability to capitalize on opportunities for additional revenue opportunities.
Human Capital 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 337 employees, including 334 full-time employees. Of the 337 employees, 231 are male and 106 are female. As of December 31, 2021, we have employees in the following countries: Australia, Belgium, 
 10

Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom and United States.
Competition for qualified personnel has historically been intense, particularly for acquisition directors, finance professionals, and software engineers. 
 At Radius, we recognize talent, respect hard work, and reward success. We are a dynamic team that aims to provide an opportunistic environment for all of our people to thrive. Our teams around the globe are our most important assets and fundamental to our success. We invest in our employees by providing training and learning opportunities, promoting inclusion and diversity, and upholding a high standard of ethics and respect for human rights. With a strong entrepreneurial culture, we embrace our core values: integrity, accountability, teamwork, and a performance-minded approach. 
 We believe in our employees’ rights of freedom of association. As of December 31, 2021, we have employees in 18 different countries and to the extent any specific country (for instance, France, Italy and Brazil) requires the employees to be part of any legally required labor group or plan, we comply with such legal requirements. We are committed to support workers’ rights to organize and bargain collectively, where allowed by the law. We maintain positive worker-management relationships that ensure compliance with national employment and labor laws. None of our employees are represented by labor unions and approximately 21% of our employees operate under collective bargaining agreements.
 Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
 
Aligned with our business strategy, our human capital strategy focuses on solutions to attract, develop, engage, and retain top diverse talent in each of the countries we operate. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are top priorities for us. To ensure success each of these remains at the core of our business culture, infusing fresh ideas, helping us remain connected to our workforce in a dynamic global market and ensuring mutual respect guides our interactions both internally and externally. We expect employees to embrace these values to ensure our work environment is inclusive and respectful, as well as, free of harassment, discrimination, and retaliation. 
 
We are committed to pay equity, regardless of gender or race/ethnicity. In 2021, our Human Resources department conducted a global pay equity analysis, which we plan to review and update (where necessary) on an annual basis.

We intend to implement a variety of initiatives in 2022 to improve workplace diversity and inclusion, including by:
 
 
• | creating a Diversity and Inclusion Policy;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | forming a Global Diversity and Inclusion Team responsible for driving our company-wide diversity and inclusion initiatives; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishing a Diversity Talent Development Program to train employees and leadership on diversity, inclusion, racial equity, and leadership.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employee Recruitment & Retention
 
We work diligently to attract talent across the globe to build teams that meet the current and future demands of our business. In 2021, our Human Resources department developed and implemented a global applicant tracking and onboarding system and provided company-wide training to hiring managers and employees. The training focused on strategic recruitment practices including defining hiring standards, conducting successful interviews, and providing orientation to new employees. 
 
During fiscal 2021, our employee population increased by approximately 8.7%, primarily due to increases in operations.
 
11


Employee Engagement
 
We manage and measure organizational health with a view to gaining insight to employees’ experiences, levels of workplace satisfaction, and feelings of engagement and inclusion. We use Employee Voice (a module within our HRIS platform (as defined below) that is a survey tool) to conduct quarterly employee surveys to measure organizational health and employee experiences. We intend to use insights from these surveys to develop company-wide organizational talent development plans. In 2022, we will use a lifecycle survey to monitor employee sentiment upon hire, as well as 30-, 60-, 90-day surveys in an effort to improve retention and help us assess the main drivers of a new hires’ success within the Company.  
Talent Development 
 
In fiscal 2021, we rolled out a global human resource information system (“HRIS”) platform that includes a learning management module. The HRIS platform is an online portal that enables employees to access instructor-led classroom or virtual courses and self-directed web-based courses as well as compliance and other workforce-related training courses. The training provided will include required courses by position level, as well as optional courses for professional development. These skill-building programs will be aligned around a common set of objectives and framework focused on compliance (including, for example on cybersecurity, anti-bribery and corruption, diversity, equity and inclusion, sexual harassment, and other ethics topics), technical, professional and management development. There is an expectation that every employee has a development goal as part of individual performance objectives and that compliance training will occur every 12 months or as required by state law. Upon completion of any training or program, each employee, through the HRIS platform, will be expected to pass a test or digitally acknowledge completion through the HRIS platform. Regular training reinforces our company-wide policies, and for our global offices, the policies and training materials have been translated into applicable local languages.
 
On an annual basis, we conduct a company-wide global performance review process that focuses on our high performing employees and the succession for our most critical roles. 
 
We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our future leaders. We have developed talent management and succession planning modules within our HRIS platform to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in sales and operations. 
 
Developing our managers is critical to our success as well. We provide resources and tools to all levels of management, including courses to meet regional needs. Managers learn tools and best practices that are intended to enable both management and team success, and strengthen competencies to better respond to the needs of a growing and complex organization.
 
Total Rewards
 We provide compensation and benefits programs that are intended to reward our employees and to help meet their needs. In addition to salaries, and varying by country/region, these programs include:

• | Annual bonuses;
--+----------------


• | Stock awards;
--+--------------


• | 401(k) and pension schemes;
--+----------------------------


• | Comprehensive healthcare and life insurance benefits;

--+----------------------------------------

 
In addition to our broad-based equity awards program, we have used targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical skills and experience.
 
12


Health, Safety and Well-being
 
The health and safety of our employees is a high priority. Our safety focus is evident, among other was, in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe. We have responded to the pandemic by, among other things:

• | Creating our COVID-19 Prevention Program;
--+------------------------------------------


• | Adding work from home flexibility;
--+-----------------------------------


• | Adjusting attendance policies in areas where offices are open to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Modifying workspaces as needed to comply with regulatory guidance; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We view mental health as a fundamental part of our humanity and implemented a comprehensive suite of related programs and benefits in fiscal 2021. These include:
 
 
- | Employee Assistance Program;
--+-----------------------------


- | One-on-one emotional support hotline; and
--+------------------------------------------


- | Mental health training and resources available on a by country-by-country basis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory and Environmental Matters
 Our international operations may be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas. Non-compliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders. Our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters. As we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas, we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions.
 In the United Kingdom, for example, we are subject to the revised Electronic Communications Code, which came into force on December 28, 2017 as part of the United Kingdom’s Digital Economy Act 2017. The Electronic Communications Code governs certain relationships between landowners and operators of electronic communications services, such as cellular towers. It gives operators certain rights to install, inspect and maintain electronic communications apparatus, including masts, cables and other equipment on land and structures, even where the operator cannot agree with the landowner as to the terms of such use. Among other measures, the Electronic Communications Code restricts the ability of landowners to charge premium prices for the use of their land by basing the consideration paid on the underlying value of the land, not the value attributable to the high public demand for communications services and provides authority to the courts to determine the rent if the parties are unable to come to agreement. We have devoted and continue to devote a significant amount of management attention and resources to mitigating the potential adverse impact of the Electronic Communications Code, including through dispute resolution, as new and existing tenants in the United Kingdom have attempted to materially reduce the amount of rents paid to us under leases as a result of this law.  To date, the Electronic Communications Code has not had a material adverse effect on our business in the United Kingdom, but we cannot provide any assurances that will continue to be successful in our efforts to mitigate the potential adverse impact of this law on our business in the United Kingdom.  If any revisions to the Electronic Communications Code are implemented or any new law, unfavorable court decision or interpretation of the Electronic Communications Code is issued, it would have a material adverse effect on our business in the United Kingdom.  For more information on the risks related to the Electronic Communications Code and currently proposed revisions to the law which would have an adverse impact on our business, see “Risk Factors—The Electronic Communications Code enacted in the United Kingdom may limit the amount of lease income we generate in the United Kingdom, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition”.
 Laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment are applicable to the communications sites in which we have a real property interest and to the businesses and operations of our lessees, property owners and other surface owners or operators. International, Federal, 
 13

state and local government agencies issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and that may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations often require permits before operations commence, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment, require remediation of released substances, and limit or prohibit construction or operations on certain lands (e.g., wetlands). Although we do not conduct any operations on our properties, the MNOs or tower companies on our communications sites may maintain small quantities of materials that, if released, would be subject to certain environmental laws. Similarly, the site owners, lessees and other surface interest owners may have liability or responsibility under these laws that could have an indirect impact on our business. For those communications sites in which we hold real property interests that are not full fee simple ownership, our liability is typically limited to damages caused by our actions. However, in limited circumstances certain jurisdictions may seek to impose liability if all other owners are not available. With respect to the communications sites that we own in fee simple, we are subject to environmental liability in accordance with local law.
 Competition
 We face competition in the acquisition of our assets. Some of the competitors are larger than us and include public entities with greater access to capital and scale of operations than us. Our principal competitors include large independent tower companies such as American Tower, Cellnex Telecom, Cornerstone, Crown Castle International, Inwit, MBNL, Phoenix Towers, SBA Communications, Telesites, Vertical Bridge and Vantage Towers, large MNOs and private and public acquirers of similar assets. In some jurisdictions, including Europe, the number of wireless towers and antennae owned by tower companies, as compared to MNOs, is growing quickly. These tower companies may be more likely to seek to own or control the land underlying their tower as that is their asset/service as compared to the MNOs who have traditionally allocated their capital to network development rather than acquisition of the underlying real property. These wireless tower companies are larger and may have greater financial resources than us.
Significant Trends
 Consumer demand for data is the primary driver of the telecom infrastructure services that our tenants, predominantly mobile network operators and tower companies, provide. Consumer demand continues to grow due to increases in data consumption and the increased penetration of bandwidth-intensive devices. There is a need for enhanced network coverage and densification to meet speed and capacity demands. We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this increase in consumer demand. The following trends are expected to continue to impact the industry:
 Mobile Data Traffic Growth. The proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets and the omnipresence of sophisticated, data-intensive mobile applications and services are expected to drive a strong demand for mobile bandwidth supporting an explosive growth of data usage. The Ericsson Mobility Report, published in June 2021 (the “Ericsson Mobility Report 2021”), estimated that around 91% of all mobile subscriptions will be for mobile broadband by the end of 2026. This demand is expected to drive major MNOs to continue to upgrade and enhance their networks in an effort to improve network quality and capacity. Additionally, global mobile data traffic is predicted to grow by 480% between 2020 and 2026, according to the Ericsson Mobility Report 2021. With users demanding faster communication speeds and higher bandwidth, and MNOs looking to compete on network quality, we expect our tenants to continue to enjoy strong demand for their services.
 Adoption of Higher Capacity Communication Standards. As data usage continues to rapidly increase, consumer demand is expected to continue to drive the transition from 2G and 3G networks to 4G/LTE and 5G networks globally. Forecasts published in the Ericsson Mobility Report 2021 predict there to be 3.5 billion 5G subscriptions globally for enhanced mobile broadband by the end of 2026, with 40% of all North American mobile subscriptions expected to be for 5G in 2026. The continued adoption of bandwidth-intensive applications is expected to result in a growing demand for high-capacity, multi-location, fiber-based network solutions.
 New Technologies and Services. Next generation technologies and new uses for wireless communications are expected to result in new entrants or increased demand in the wireless industry, which may include companies involved in the continued evolution and deployment of machine-to-machine applications (“M2M”), such as connected cars, smart cities and virtual reality. As one example of M2M connections, the proliferation of self-driving cars is expected to significantly accelerate in the near future. The commercial application of partially and fully autonomous vehicles will require the deployment of sophisticated and dense mobile networks, with high connection speeds, 
 14

reliability and low latency. This and other increases in new technologies and services will require further development of new infrastructures to meet territorial and population coverage requirements.
 Consolidation Among MNOs. The U.S. wireless industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation, such as the 2020 merger between Sprint and T-Mobile, resulting in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites, due to overlap of the networks or the rationalization of technology. Internationally, MNOs are increasingly entering into active and passive network sharing agreements or roaming or resale arrangements which could also result in decommissioning of certain existing communications sites due to network overlap or redundancy. To the extent that a MNO does not need a redundant communication site, it may seek to early terminate or not renew its lease. Consolidation can also potentially reduce the diversity of tenants and give tenants greater leverage over their landlords, such as us, due to overlapping coverage, ability to increase co-location on nearby existing sites and through aggressive lease negotiations on multiple sites.

Privacy and Data Protection
 
We are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity, including, among others:
 
 
• | the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which came into effect in January of 2020, and the California Privacy Rights Act which will go into effect in 2023, both of which give new data privacy rights to California residents;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | data protection laws in U.S. states and certain countries regarding notification to data subjects and/or regulators when there is a security breach of personal data;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which imposes stringent data protection requirements on companies that receive or process personal information from European Union (“EU”) residents; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We collect, use, disclose, store and process data of (i) site owners who have agreements with mobile network operators and telecommunication infrastructure providers, (ii) the MNOs and tower companies from whom we receive rental payments, (iii) our employees, and (iv) other service providers. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of state, local and foreign laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations and industry standards. 
 
The legal and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increase in attention given to privacy and data protection issues with the potential to impact our business. Regulatory focus on data privacy and security concerns continues to increase globally, and laws and regulations concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information are expanding and becoming more complex. We are continuing to assess the impact of new and proposed data privacy and protection laws and proposed amendments to existing laws on our business. 
 
In the United States, such laws and regulations include state and federal breach notification laws and consumer protection laws, as well as state laws addressing privacy and data security. Internationally, various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have established, or are developing, data privacy and security legal frameworks with which we must comply. In certain cases, these international laws and regulations are more restrictive than those in the United States. 
 
U.S. and global laws and regulations may require notification to individuals and government authorities in the event of a breach of certain personal data, which could result in increased costs stemming from the notification itself or a regulatory inquiry. Any changes in privacy and data protection laws or regulations could also adversely impact the way we use e-mail, text messages and other marketing techniques and could require changes to our marketing strategies. We have a privacy policy posted on our website at www.radiusglobal.com. Our privacy policies may change over time as expectations regarding privacy and data change.
 
Our significant operations in the EU are subject to the GDPR, which applies to all our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to adjacent operations that we proceed to in the EU. It also imposes stringent data 
 15

protection requirements on companies that receive or process personal information from EU residents and establishes significant penalties for non-compliance. 
 
Violation of the GDPR can result in administrative fines of up to EUR 20 million or 4% of annual worldwide revenues, whichever is greater. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by data controllers, customers and data subjects. Further, the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU (“Brexit”) has created uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom. In particular, although the United Kingdom enacted a Data Protection Act in May 2018 that is designed to be consistent with the GDPR, uncertainty remains regarding how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated following Brexit.
 
In addition, some countries are considering or have enacted data localization laws requiring that user data regarding users in their country be maintained, stored, and/or processed in their country. Maintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly.
 
We have implemented data transfer mechanisms to provide for the transfer of personal information from the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or the United Kingdom to the United States. However, there are certain unsettled legal issues regarding the adequacy of data transfers to the United States, the resolution of which may adversely impact our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the EEA.
 
Our efforts to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws, regulations and other obligations, which include a long-term engagement with a cybersecurity firm to assess IT security and implement IT best practices, penetration testing by independent external parties on a recurring basis and investment in additional server hardware and licenses to monitor security events through the use of a Security Information and Event Management System (“SIEM”), is costly, and we may encounter difficulties, delays or significant expenses in connection with our compliance, or because of our customers’ need to comply or our customers’ interpretation of their own legal requirements. 
 
For more information on risks related to privacy and data protection, see “Risk Factors—We are subject to laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, information and cybersecurity, and the costs of compliance with, and potential liability associated with, our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.”
