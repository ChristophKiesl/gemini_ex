General development of business.
 
UC Asset LP partnership (“UC Asset,” the “Company,” the “Partnership”, “we,” or “us”) is a limited partnership formed on February 01, 2016 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We invest in our portfolio investments for the purpose of capital appreciation. According to our bylaws, the overwhelming majority of our portfolio investments must be allocated to real estate in metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, GA and Dallas, TX. Our portfolio investments are owned through a number of subsidiaries, which may develop, redevelop, operate and trade these properties for the purpose of expanding our portfolio, increasing capital appreciation, and exiting from investments. As of March 31, 2021, all of our subsidiaries are wholly-owned and controlled by us. Our principal office address is 2299 Perimeter Park Drive, Suite 120, Atlanta, GA 30341.
 
Our partnership is managed by our general partner, UCF Asset LLC under the terms of our partnership’s Limited Partnership Agreement. Except for limited conditions defined in our limited partnership agreement, UCF Asset LLC acting as general partner has authority to exercise full management of our partnership. Limited partners are passive investors and have limited power over our partnership and our general partner.

UCF Asset LLC is a limited liability company formed on January 26, 2016 under the law of the State of Georgia. The principal office of our general partner is the same to that of our partnership.
 
The individuals who, directly or indirectly, own and control our general partner are “Larry” Xianghong Wu with an 80% interest and Gregory Bankston with a 20% interest. Gregory Bankston is the managing member of our general partner.
 
UCF Asset LLC does not conduct any business activities other than management of our partnership.

Business Operations
 
By and as of December 31, 2020, our operations primarily consist of our ownership interests in Atlanta Landsight LLC, SHOC Holdings LLC, and Hotal LLC, all of them are Georgia limited liability companies,. Our partnership owns 100% of all these subsidiaries.
 
Atlanta Landsight LLC, (“ALS”), invests in residential and commercial properties in the Atlanta metropolitan area. The primary goal of Atlanta Landsight’s business is to support the interests of the wider group of investors in UC Asset LP. Its investment strategy involves acquiring a property, renovating or remodeling it, and placing it back on the market for sale, or renting it out for continuous rental income. All the development and redevelopment works are performed by third party contractors, of which the P&L will not contribute to ALS’s gains and losses. Occasionally, ALS also invested in residential properties in other metropolitan areas. As of December 31, 2020, ALS has decreased its holdings in residential property, but has not made any investments in commercial real estate. Over time, we expect that commercial properties will account for the majority of ALS’s portfolio.

SHOC Holdings LLC (“SHOC LLC”) is a start-up with an innovative business model to invest in and develop properties located in communities adjacent to major airports and/or central business districts for shared home-office accommodations. We founded SHOC LLC in the fourth quarter of 2020 by contributing an initial capital of $900,000, which included $200,000 of cash and $700,000 of short-term notes assigned to SHOC LLC. As of December 31, 2020, SHOC LLC had not made any investment. It would make its first investment by acquiring a 10-unit apartment building in downtown Atlanta in April, 2021, for a consideration of approximately $750,000.
 
Hotal Services LLC (“HOTAL”) is a start-up whose business strateg is to invest in hospitality properties. We formed HOTAL in the fourth quarter of 2020 by investing a nominal amount of capital and by assigning to it certain intangible assets, including the registered brand name “Hotal “ and website “theHotal.com. ” Those intangible assets are not valued and carry zero book value.
 
UC Asset LP also invests in private debts and other non-property-based opportunities, to the extent that the revenue generated from those debts and other opportunities will not exceed ten percent (10%) of total revenue of the Partnership. From inception through December 31, 2020, UC Asset LP held debt investments of approximately $750,000 in total. $700,000 of those debts were assigned to SHOC LLC as capital contribution in the fourth quarter of 2020.
 
Historical Investments
 
In November 2016, we formed UCF Development LLC (“UCFD”), a Texas limited liability company, with a non-afflicated third party, and we owned 75% of its outstanding ownership interests. UCFD then invested by acquiring a 72-acre farm in Farmersville, Texas, which is located in the Dallas metropolitan area. In February 2018, we bought out the other investor and we became 100% owner of UCFD. Total cost of owning 100% interest of the farmland is approximately $850,000.
 
The original plan was to partner with developer to develop the farmland into 40-50 lots for residential properties. UCFD aborted the plan in the beginning of the year 2020 and transferred the Farmersville farmland to ALS through a nominal transaction. UCFD was dissolved in November 2020. The farmland was sold by ALS in November 2020 for $1,300,000.00.
 
Narrative description of business.
 
The business purpose of our Partnership is to invest for capital appreciation.
 
By and of the date of December 31, 2021, our partnership primarily invest in residential properties for capital appreciation in the Atlanta metropolitan area. We have made our first commercial property investment in the second quarter of 2021, and expect to expanding our portfolio to include more commercial properties.
 
We perform our investment activities through a number of subsidiaries, which are usually wholly-owned or majority-owned by us, and all of them operate for the business purpose of real estate investment.
 
Our investment strategy is to look for high-growth and value-added investment patterns in real estate. Each of our subsidiaries are expected to create and implement their unique high-growth and value-added investment patterns or models. The management of Partnership will work continuously to identify such investment patterns/models, and then invest in existing companies or form new companies of which the business purposes are to implement those strategies/models for greater capital appreciation.
 
Specifically, new technologies are changing people’s life, changing their way to live, work and travel. Hence new technologies are redefining the concept of “property” for both residential and commercial properties. We believe that technology will create many new opportunities for value-added, high-growth investment patterns/models in real estate.
 
Residential Investment in Metropolitan Atlanta
 
Our subsidiary, Atlanta Landsight LLC, a Georgia limited liability company, acquires and redevelops residential real estate properties in metropolitan Atlanta, mostly in suburban regions north of downtown Atlanta, known as Brookhaven, Dunwoody and Marietta, and in downtown Atlanta. Atlanta is the ninth largest metropolitan area in the United States.

Upon acquisition of a property, Atlanta Landsight LLC may make improvements intended to increase its value before putting it back on the market for sale. Depending on the condition of a property, the improvements may be renovation, remodeling, or a complete tear-down and rebuild of the residential home. After improvements, ALS management may sell the completed project immediately if management believes the submarket has reached its short-term peak; or, they may rent it out for a period, usually 12 months, if management believes that the submarket has potential of appreciation in the coming year. All the works of improvements are performed and managed by independent third parties, of which ALS is not responsible for its profit and loss (P&L) and their P&L will have no substantial impact on ALS’s gain or loss.
 
ALS may resell a property without improvement if the value appreciation has generated a satisfactory ROI, or if there are any reasonable business considerations.
 
Renovation
 
Renovating a property usually includes optimizing spaces, fixing or replacing water, power and HVAC equipment, installing new flooring, upgrading the kitchen and bathrooms, installing new appliances, and/or painting of interior and exterior walls. Renovation can be a relatively low-cost method to improve the value of a property.
 
For the fiscal year of 2019, ALS completed 7 residential renovation projects in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Three properties were sold, and three were rented out, and one property was still listed for sale as of December 31, 2019. This property was ultimately sold in the first quarter of 2020.
 
For the fiscal year of 2020, ALS completed one residential renovation project in the Atlanta metropolitan area. It was sold in early August 2020. ALS terminated the lease of one of the rental properties, and listed it for sale in May 2020. This property was sold in early August 2020.
 
Remodeling
 
A remodeled property may include many of the renovations described above, but it can also include changes to the structure, usually by adding more space and altering floor plans. Remodeling will usually cost more than renovation but less than rebuilding, and its return on investment (“ROI”) will usually be higher than renovation but lower than rebuilding.
 
For the fiscal years 2019 and 2020, ALS did not have any remodeling projects. Atlanta Landsight LLC’s last remodeling project was completed in 2017. It was rented out for several years before eventually sold in June 2021.
 
Rebuilding
 
If the condition of a property is in such poor shape that it would not be cost effective to repair it, it may be a candidate to tear down and rebuild. When choosing properties to rebuild, ALS management prefers those in a neighborhood where other active rebuilding projects have taken place and completed rebuilt properties have been sold.
 
For the fiscal year of 2019, ALS completed two rebuilding projects in the Atlanta metropolitan area. One of them was sold, and the other one was rented out in June, 2020.
 
For the fiscal year of 2020 and till the first quarter of 2021, ALS completed one rebuilding project and it was sold in April 2021.

Starting from the second quarter of 2020, ALS has been decreasing its portfolio in residential properties. The process continued in 2021, as the management project that residential market has reached its short-term peak. As of December 31, 2020, ALS owned six residential properties in metro Atlanta; one residential property in Greensboro, North Carolina and developable land in Farmersville, Texas.
 
Of these seven properties, ALS has completed redevelopment of four and is in the process of redevelopment of one. These five properties are for sale or leased out on annual contracts. Monthly revenue on four rental properties is approximately $14,600 as of December 31, 2020. The net market value of those five rental properties was assessed at approximately $3.25 million in total, as of January 2021. One other property is currently on hold and to be listed for sale by summer of 2021. The projected listing price will be approximately $565,000.
 
Two properties are currently under hold due to uncertainty of their submarkets. These two properties have a total net market value of approximately $291,000, as of December 31, 2021.
 
As of December 31, 2020, the fair market value of most of ALS’ residential properties was obtained by appraisals conducted by an independent and licensed appraiser, i.e., Real Estate Valuation Inc, except for the two properties that were under hold due to uncertainty. The fair market value of these two properties were assessed using a method developed by the management. This method has been reviewed and approved by an independent and licensed third party. – i.e. Brandon Atkins from Keller Williams (Atlanta Perimeter office).
 
SHOC (“Shared Home Office Cluster/Community”) property investment in Metro Atlanta
 
SHOC is a new concept of properties similar to the “home rentals” business model developed and operated by companies such as Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) and Vrbo. The improvement from common “home rentals” is that SHOC properties are defined as home-offices for rent.
 
Home rentals have become trendy and are perceived as alternatives to conventional hotels. So far, home rentals have become an appealing choice for leisure travelers, but not as appealing to business travelers. According to our research, there are two major factors that are preventing business travelers from using home rentals instead of conventional business hotels. First, most home rental properties are residential properties , absent of business facilities, such as conference rooms. Secondly, most home rental properties are not adjacent to either major airports or the center business districts, which make them geographically not convenient for business travelers. To address those concerns, we have come up with the concept SHOC, standing for Shared Home-Office Community or Shared Home-Office Cluster (depending on the density of our SHOC properties). In comparison to conventional hotel rooms, SHOC will be equipped with home-office facilities such as hi-speed internet, video conferencing, easy access to office accessories such as printers and scanners, and other tools to empower today’s business travelers. But it also presents the personalized charm, including home-style full-equipped kitchen, to serve travelers with a home office away from home.
 
Further, we believe that SHOC can be a powerful business model when renovating communities. In many metro cities, there are distressed residential communities adjacent to airports or central business districts (CBDs). Those distressed communities are suffering from not only the loss of property values, but also the loss of business revenues. SHOC builders are not only renovating houses, but also turning those houses into income-generating businesses. As the result, it will improve the well-being of communities, and may deliver better returns on our investments.
 
SHOC holdings LLC(“SHOC LLC”) is the start-up focusing on development of SHOC properties. We own 100% of the ownership interests in SHOC LLC. Before the formation of SHOC LLC, another investee of ours, namely Atlanta Landsight LLC (“ALS”) , has made successful investments into home renovations in distressed communities. With very few pilot projects, ALS made over 50% annualized return on a single sale. We believe ALS’s expertise is transferable to SHOC LLC, which will be a benefit to the development of SHOC’s business.
 
For the fiscal year of 2020:
 
SHOC LLC has just started and has done some research and development of its products, and has searched and screened properties that could potentially become SHOC properties, however, no projects have been completed, and no revenues have been generated at this time.

Hotal LLC
 
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we formed Hotal LLC with purpose to apply innovative investment models in hospitality properties. As of December 31, 2020, it had not made any investments.
 
Farmland Investment in Metropolitan Dallas
 
In September 2016, our subsidiary UCF Development LLC (“UCFD”) purchased 76% of a 72.53-acre farmland located within the township of Farmersville, Texas, in Collin County, located in the northeast quadrant of the Dallas Metropolitan Area. In February 2018, UCFD purchased the remaining 24% of this property, and this land is now included in our investment, Atlanta Landsight LLC.
 
The purchase price in September, 2016 for the Farmersville property was $805,216. The total historical cost for this property (including commissions, taxes, consulting fees etc.) is approximately $900,000, as of September 30, 2020.
 
The value of the Farmersville, TX property is solely based on the valuation by independent and licensed third parties. The most up-to-date appraisal report valued the property at $1,088,000.00 as of December 19, 2019. This report was provided by Michelle Godwin from Valuright Appraisal, Inc.
 
This property was sold for $1,300,000.00 in October, 2020.
 
Debt Investments
 
We have made a limited number of debt investments from time to time. These investments were in the form of promissory notes or private loans , to related and unrelated third parties. As of December 31, 2020, we have made $2,320,000 of debt investments since inception, with $1,982,754 outstanding. $700,000 of outstanding debt investments are held under our investee SHOC Holdings LLC, and are not secured. $1,200,000 of outstanding debt investments are held under our investee ALS. The $1,200,000 note under ALS was generated from a seller financing sale of our farmland property, and is secured by the property itself.
 
Revenue from our debt investment, mostly interests, adds up to approximately $31,581 in 2020, which accounts for less than 1% of our overall revenue, which stands at approximately $4,526,233 in 2020.
 
Status of Publicly Announced New Services 
 
In May 2020, we announced that we were offering, through and to be managed by Atlanta Landsight LLC , a pandemic mortgage debt relief program for businesses experiencing financial emergencies due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This program is aimed at acquiring equities in commercial properties which are suffering from the impact of Covid-19 pandemic.
 
As of December 31, 2020, this new service has been terminated due to inadequate demand from the market. We have spent approximately $5000 in marketing and promoting this program. which represents total cost associated with this program.
 
Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition
 

1. | Unique legal structure
---+-----------------------

 
UC Asset is structured as a Master Limited Partnership (MLP) rather than a real estate investment trust (REIT) in order to focus on long-term value growth. The Company is among one of the very few real estate MLPs trading on US public markets. As of the date of April 2, 2021, there are only two real estate property MLPs listed on national exchangs including NASDQA and NYSE, according to Energy Infrastructure Council (was Master Limited Partnership Association). As for OTCQX where we are quoted, it appears that we are the only real estate property MLP.
 
This unique legal structure empowers UC Asset to take a longer-term approach to real estate investments, because MLPs do not have to constantly make cash distributions as REITs are required to do. According to a research report released by Zack Small Cap Research, by its analyst Beth Senko, on April 20, 2020, MLPs “are best suited to long-term investors seeking above-average returns without the need for regular cash distributions.”

Our partnership does not have a term limit, and does not have an obligation to make cash distributions like a REIT will have. This means we may hold any investment indefinitely for the purpose of capital appreciation, or may exist any investment at any time. Such flexibility empowers us to make better investment decisions and potentially to reach better return on investments.
 

2. | Community based approach
---+-------------------------

 
UC Asset stands for United Community Asset. We believe that the “Best Real Estate Investment is to Invest into Community Growth”. We are committed to long-term community growth as our asset management strategy, based on the concept that real estate portfolios can serve a dual purpose of offering an attractive ROI for investors, while creating a sense of community and having positive and multifaceted impacts on life of residents. 
 

- | Since our incorporation, we have invested most of our capital into Atlanta Landsight LLC, which focuses on improving communities through renovating, remodeling and rebuilding properties.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | In October 2020, we formed SHOC LLC, which envisions, designs and will build properties named SHOC, standing for “Shared Home-Office Cluster/Community”. SHOC is a revolutionary concept of futuristic communities, that will combine residential and commercial spaces, and bring back the lifestyle that human beings enjoyed for tens of thousands of years before the industrial age: -- i.e. Live where we work. We believe that a community in which people live where they work, is more efficient, more eco-friendly, more productive, and, more human.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | In January 2021, we announced that the Company will donate up to $50,000 to nonprofits working to eradicate the backlash against Asian Americans and stop anti-Asian violence. The announcement came after a mass-shooting in Atlanta killed eight victims, including six Asian women, amid a nationwide rising of anti-Asian violence. In addition, we have been in contact with a national-level Asian American non-profit, which is headquartered in metro Atlanta. We are discussing possible Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) to build a community center in Atlanta, as a platform for Asian Americans to better participate in community affairs in close alliance with other ethnic groups.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
All the actions discussed above showcase our commitment to a community-based approach, and to our belief that the “Best Real Estate Investment Is to Invest into Community Growth”.
 

3. | Innovative investment strategies
---+---------------------------------

 
Real estate is widely considered a “conventional” industry and has limited room for innovation. However, the advancement of new technologies, particularly, information technology (“IT”), are redefining our living and working space and we believe that these developments will disrupt conventional wisdom in the real estate industry.
 
The management of UC Asset have background in IT and internet and have closely followed the application of new technologies in real estate. We will always look for and will invest in companies which have innovative and disruptive business models in response to new technologies.
 
For example, our subsidiary SHOC executes an innovative business model that is based on two new trends: 1) the development of new technologies that empower remote work and blur the border between working, living and lodging; and 2) the popularity of online-platforms have merged the marketplaces of commercial hospitality properties, office properties and residential properties. The business model of SHOC is heavily technology-driven, and can potentially be very disruptive.
 
We are also actively looking for other innovative business models in which to invest. For example, we are very interested in the application of block-chain technology and non-fungible token(NFT) technology into real estate development and operations.
 
Number of Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has two full time employees, who are the two members of our General Partner, UCF Asset LLC. The Company has five part time employees, including a project manager, an accountant, an investor relations director, and two Audit Committee members.
