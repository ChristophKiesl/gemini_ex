ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW 
The terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Company” and “Integra” refer to Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries, unless the context suggests otherwise. 
Integra, headquartered in Plainsboro, New Jersey, is a world leader in medical technology. The Company employs approximately 3,700 people around the world who are dedicated to limiting uncertainty for surgeons, so that they can concentrate on providing the best care for their patients. Integra offers innovative solutions, including leading regenerative technologies, specialty surgical solutions, and orthopedic solutions. Revenues grew to $992.1 million in 2016, an increase of 12% from $882.7 million in 2015. 
Integra was founded on an engineered collagen technology platform that is used to repair and regenerate tissue. The Company has developed numerous product lines from this technology for applications ranging from burn and deep tissue wounds to repair of dura mater in the brain to repair of nerve and tendon. Over the past 30 years, Integra has grown by building upon this core regenerative technology, acquiring businesses in markets with overlapping customer bases, and developing products to further meet the needs of target customers.
On October 25, 2016, our Board of Directors recommended, subject to stockholder approval, an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 60.0 million shares to 240.0 million shares, par value $0.01 per share, for the purpose of, among other things, affecting a two-for-one stock split. The stockholders approved the Amendment on its special Stockholders' Meeting on December 21, 2016. The Company filed a certificate of amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effect the increase in authorized shares of common stock and the two-for-one-stock split. Stockholders of record as of the close of market on December 21, 2016 were entitled to receive one additional share of common stock for each share held. The shares were distributed on January 3, 2017. No fractional shares of common stock were issued as a result of the two-for-one stock split. The adjusted stock price was reflected on the NASDAQ stock market on January 4, 2017. 
The shares of common stock retained a par value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, the stockholders' equity reflects the stock split by reclassifying from "Additional paid-in capital" to "Common stock" for an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split. All references in this Form 10-K to the number of shares of common stock, price per share and weighted average shares of common stock have been adjusted to reflect the post-split amounts, unless otherwise indicated.
VISION
We aspire to be a multi-billion dollar diversified global medical technology company that helps patients by limiting uncertainty for healthcare professionals. Our customers will recognize us as a leader in specialty surgical applications, regenerative technologies and extremities orthopedics worldwide. 
STRATEGY 
Our strategy is built around three pillars - execute, optimize, and accelerate growth. These three pillars support our strategic initiatives to deliver on our commitments through improved planning and communication, optimize our infrastructure, and grow our revenues by introducing new products to the market through internal development, geographic expansion, and strategic acquisitions. 
This is an essential strategic approach for two reasons. First, the costs inherent in operating a medical technology company have increased at an accelerating rate in recent years and continue to rise. Scale is therefore correlated with rates of profitability in our industry. Our strategic response is to focus efforts and investments on accelerating growth in the clinical areas where we compete today. Second, we compete in a complex and highly regulated industry, and we have grown through more than 45 acquisitions in our history. We have made significant accomplishments in the past several years to reduce our operational footprint, simplify our organizational structure and build platforms for common systems. To effectively execute on our plans to grow our core business and integrate acquisitions, we must continue to improve our infrastructure and processes. These improvements will fortify a solid platform from which to grow our business. 
Our executive leadership team has set forth the following several near-term objectives aligned to this strategy: 
Portfolio Optimization. We are investing in innovative product development to drive a multi-generational pipeline for our key product franchises. Our product development efforts focus on regenerative technologies and other projects with the potential for significant returns on investment. We have a goal of generating at least one quarter of our organic growth in any 
4

one year from products launched in the previous two to three years. These recent efforts have contributed to an active schedule of impactful product launches. In addition to new product development, we are funding studies to gather clinical evidence to support launches, ensure market access and improve reimbursement for existing products. We also continue to identify low-growth, low-margin products and product franchises for discontinuation and will continue to look at other ways of optimizing our portfolio. 
Commercial Channel Optimization and International Expansion. Through the acquisition of TEI Biosciences, Inc. and TEI Medical Inc. (collectively "TEI") in July 2015 and the 2016 launch of OmnigraftTM for diabetic foot ulcers, we have established a new presence in the outpatient segment of the fast-growing advanced wound care market. We have built up this commercial channel and support infrastructure to facilitate the Omnigraft product launch. Our 3x3 strategy takes advantage of our unique position to call upon providers in three sales channels (inpatient, outpatient, and multi-center enterprise-wide contracting) and offer three product families for advanced wound healing (engineered collagen, acellular collagen and human amniotic wound dressings). We also see an opportunity to accelerate revenue growth by increasing our international presence. In order to achieve this, we are expanding our commercial infrastructure in key markets and securing ownership or other control of our product registrations and distribution system. Additionally, we have a plan for registering and launching our existing products in countries where we already have a selling presence, but are missing key leading brands. We expect this focus on key markets and products that carry both high margins and relevant price points to increase our international business. More broadly, to compete successfully against much larger, diversified medical technology competitors, we are building upon our leadership brands across our product franchises and engaging hospital systems through enterprise-wide contracts. 
Strategic Corporate Development. Over the years, we have successfully acquired and in-licensed businesses, products and technologies to grow our business. Our corporate development program is a core competency, and an important part of our strategy is to continue to pursue strategic transactions and licensing agreements to increase relevant scale in the clinical areas in which we compete. Heading into 2017, closing the acquisition of the Codman Neurosurgery business of Johnson & Johnson ("Codman Neurosurgery") and integrating Derma Sciences, Inc. ("Derma Sciences") will be key objectives for the company. Acquisitions, in particular, may expand international distribution, add a technology platform, increase the scale of one of our current portfolios, or provide access into an adjacent growth area that leverages the sales channel. We focus our efforts on the clinical areas of wound care, extremities orthopedics, and specialty surgical applications. Our corporate development capabilities are increasingly important to remain competitive in today's environment. 
Finally, we are investing in training programs to strengthen our leadership bench in the organization, and we continue to invest in targeted additions to our sales organization to improve market coverage. These initiatives, investments, and talent development efforts will strengthen the foundation necessary to support a faster growing, multi-billion dollar global medical technology company. Our strategy to execute, optimize and accelerate growth will enable us to continue to be a company that helps limit uncertainty for customers and touches millions of patients each year, while driving returns for shareholders.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
We currently manufacture and sell our products in the following two global reportable business segments: Specialty Surgical Solutions and Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies. We include financial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information under "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Note 15, Segment and Geographic Information to our consolidated financial statements. 
Specialty Surgical Solutions
Our Specialty Surgical Solutions business offers specialty surgical instrumentation for a broad range of specialties, including a market-leading product portfolio used in the neurosurgery operating suite and critical care unit.
We sell products and solutions for dural repair, precision tools and instruments, tissue ablation, and neuro critical care, including related service and repair. For neurosurgeons, we have products for each step of a procedure and the care of the patient after surgery, from both equipment and implants used in the neurosurgery operating room to monitoring in the neurosurgery intensive care unit. We are also among the largest surgical instrument suppliers in the United States to hospitals, acute care surgical centers, and clinician offices. Our portfolio includes over 60,000 instrument patterns and surgical products, surgical headlight systems and table-mounted retractors that address a broad set of surgical specialties.
In the United States, Specialty Surgical Solutions products are sold through a combination of directly employed sales representatives, sales agents and distributors, depending on the customer call point. We have a specialized sales organization composed of directly employed sales representatives who primarily call on neurosurgeons and the neuro critical care unit. In addition, we have a sales organization consisting of a combination of directly employed sales representatives and sales agents who primarily call on the central sterile processing unit of hospitals and acute care surgical centers. Finally, we reach the 
5

diverse alternate site call point, which includes physician, dental and veterinary offices, through distributors. Internationally, we sell certain products and product lines from the Specialty Surgical Solutions portfolio through a combination of direct efforts, primarily in certain European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, and through distributors in other countries. 
Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies
Our Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies business offers a unique combination of differentiated soft tissue repair and tissue regeneration products, and small bone fixation and joint replacement solutions. 
We sell regenerative technology products that can be used to provide treatment for acute wounds, such as burns, chronic wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, surgical tissue repair including hernia repair, peripheral nerve repair and protection, and tendon repair. For extremity bone and joint reconstruction procedures, we sell hardware products, such as bone and joint fixation and joint replacement devices, implants and instruments, which provide for the orthopedic reconstruction of bone in the hand, wrist, elbow and shoulder (Upper Extremity), and the foot, ankle and leg below the knee (Lower Extremity). 
In the United States, we have a specialized sales organization composed of directly employed sales representatives, as well as specialty distributors, organized based upon their call point. A team of extremities sales representatives calls on surgeons who treat acute wounds in hospitals, extremity orthopedic disorders, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, wrist, ankle and shoulder arthroplasty, and other conditions requiring foot or hand reconstruction. In addition, we sell our shoulder products through a specialty distributor network of sales agents who call on shoulder surgeons. A team of wound care clinic sales representatives calls on physicians who treat chronic wounds in the outpatient wound care clinic setting. A team of surgical sales representatives calls on surgeons who treat patients requiring surgical tissue repair and reconstruction. Finally, we have a small group of clinical sales specialists who focus on our regenerative products and support these three sales organizations - extremities, wound care and surgical - to address their clinicians' needs as they relate to this class of products. Outside the United States, we have a small direct sales presence, primarily in certain European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, and utilize distributors in other international markets to sell certain products and product lines from the Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies portfolio.
This segment also includes private-label sales of a broad set of our regenerative technologies. Our customers are other medical technology companies that sell to end markets primarily in orthopedics, spine, surgical and wound care.
PRODUCTS - OVERVIEW 
We offer thousands of products for the medical specialties we target. Our objective is to develop, acquire or otherwise provide products that will limit uncertainty for hospitals and surgeons. These products include our regenerative technology implants, metal implants, instruments and equipment for small bone orthopedic surgery and specialty surgical applications. We distinguish ourselves by emphasizing the importance of regenerative technology, which we define as surgical implants derived from our proprietary collagen matrix technology and other biologic platforms that enable or facilitate the body's healing process and are resorbed. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY 
Our research and development activities focus on identifying unmet surgical needs and addressing those needs with innovative solutions and products. We apply our core competency in regenerative technology to products for neurosurgical, orthopedic and wound applications, and we have extensive programs for our core platforms of orthopedic hardware and electromechanical technologies. We are focusing our research and development efforts on the development of innovative products and clinical studies to generate efficacy and health economic evidence.
Regenerative Technologies. Because regenerative technology products represent a fast-growing, high-margin opportunity for us, we allocate a large portion of our research and development budget to these projects. Our regenerative technology development program applies our expertise in bioengineering to a range of biomaterials including, natural collagen and human tissues as well as synthetics such as polymers. These unique product designs are used for neurosurgical and orthopedic surgical applications, as well as dermal regeneration, including the healing of chronic and acute wounds, tendon and nerve repair. After finalizing our multi-center clinical trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the INTEGRA® Dermal Regeneration Template for the Treatment of Diabetic Foot Ulcer ("DFU") in 2015, we filed a submission with the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and received Premarket Approval ("PMA") approval on January 7, 2016. The Company started commercializing the resulting DFU product, Omnigraft, in 2016. Additionally, we finalized patient follow-up in a Post Approval Study for our DuraSeal® Exact Spine Sealant System, and submitted the study results to the FDA in October 2016. The study demonstrated the continued safety and effectiveness of this product, and we expect that this study will satisfy the post-approval 
6

commitment related to it. We are investing in the development of next generation products, including nerve products, anti-microbial adjuncts for primary wound management, and specific chronic wound care solutions for the inpatient and outpatient settings, additional clinical studies for indications to support existing products, including ongoing studies of the use of our products in chronic wound, abdominal wall, and complex wounds and for an approval for a breast reconstruction indication as well as longer-term research programs to evaluate combination products. 
Orthopedic Reconstruction. We develop fixation and small joint reconstruction implants and instruments for upper and lower extremities to both provide next generation solutions and expand our product portfolio. This portfolio focuses on joint replacement products. Integra already has a strong shoulder portfolio, which includes a total shoulder system and a reverse shoulder. We continue to work on advanced shoulder products and are developing a pyrocarbon hemi-shoulder product to add to that portfolio. We have a strong differentiated asset that resides in our exclusively licensed pyrocarbon products, and we continue to invest to bring new products to market with this technology, which has shown significantly less wear on bone than traditional metals. Our Cadence® total ankle replacement product launched in 2016 and complements the acquired Salto Talaris® ankle. The two ankles address different market needs with the Cadence ankle designed to simplify the ankle replacement procedure and maximize reproducibility through its instrumentation and technique. 
Electromechanical Technologies and Instrumentation. Because our electromechanical products and instruments represent products that limit uncertainty for surgeries, we continue to invest in approvals for new indications and next generation improvements to our market-leading products. We have several active program focused on life cycle management and innovation on both capital and disposable products in our portfolio. We also work with a number of primarily German instrument partners to bring new surgical instrument patterns to the market, enabling us to add new instruments with minimal expense. Finally, our lighting franchise is among the most dynamic in the industry, and we continue to invest in ongoing development in LED technology.
COMPETITION 
Our primary competitors in specialty surgical solutions are the Aesculap division of B. Braun Medical, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic, Inc., Stryker Corporation, Becton, Dickinson and Company, and C.R. Bard, Inc. In addition, we compete with many smaller specialized companies and larger companies that do not otherwise focus on specialty surgical solutions. We rely on the depth and breadth of our sales and marketing organization, our innovative technology, and our procurement operation to maintain our competitive position in much of our precision tools and instruments portfolio. 
Our competition in orthopedics and tissue technologies includes the DePuy/Synthes business of Johnson & Johnson, Stryker Corporation, Wright Medical Group, N.V., Smith & Nephew plc, MiMedx Group, Inc., Acelity L.P. Inc., a subsidiary of Allergan PLC, and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., as well as other major orthopedic companies that carry a full line of small bone and joint fixation and soft tissue products. 
Finally, in certain cases our products compete primarily against medical practices that treat a condition without using a medical device or any particular product, such as medical practices that utilize autograft tissue instead of our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products and nerve repair products. Depending on the product line, we compete on the basis of our products' features, strength of our sales force or distributors, sophistication of our technology and cost effectiveness of our solution. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
We are a manufacturer and marketer of medical devices, and therefore are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the Center for Medicare Services of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, other federal governmental agencies and, in some jurisdictions, by state and foreign governmental authorities. These regulations govern the introduction of new medical devices, the observance of certain standards with respect to the design, manufacture, testing, labeling, promotion and sales of the devices, the maintenance of certain records, the ability to track devices, the reporting of potential product defects, the import and export of devices, and other matters. 
United States Food and Drug Administration
We have an outstanding FDA warning letter related to TEI Biosciences Inc., an acquisition by Integra on July 17, 2015. TEI Biosciences Inc. received a Warning Letter from the FDA dated May 29, 2015 for promoting the product SurgiMend for breast surgery applications that were not cleared in the 510(k) process and do not have a PMA Approval for the indication. The FDA requested that TEI Biosciences Inc. immediately cease all activities that resulted in misbranding or adulteration of the product in commercial distribution. The FDA also required TEI Biosciences Inc. to cease all violations regarding promotion of the product for an indication that it was not cleared or approved. TEI Biosciences Inc. responded with a corrective action plan to the FDA and took action to address the issues prior to the completion of the acquisition. We will continue to monitor this activity and address all corrective actions submitted to the FDA. The FDA may not accept our corrective action plan or it may choose to scrutinize 
7

other promotional claims on products and require additional corrective actions. We do not expect to incur material operating expenses to complete the corrective action plan.
The regulatory process of obtaining product approvals and clearances can be onerous and costly. The FDA requires, as a condition to marketing a medical device in the United States, that we secure a Premarket Notification clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”) or an approved PMA application (or supplemental PMA application). Obtaining these approvals and clearances can take up to several years and may involve preclinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA also may require a post-approval clinical study as a condition of approval. To perform clinical trials for significant risk devices in the United States on an unapproved product, we are required to obtain an Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") from the FDA. The FDA may also require a filing for approval prior to marketing products that are modifications of existing products or new indications for existing products. Moreover, after clearance/approval is given, if the product is shown to be hazardous or defective, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies have the power to withdraw the clearance or approval, as the case may be, or require us to change the device, its manufacturing process or its labeling, to supply additional proof of its safety and effectiveness or to recall, repair, replace or refund the cost of the medical device. Because we currently export medical devices manufactured in the United States that have not been approved by the FDA for distribution in the United States, we are required to obtain approval/registration in the country to which we are exporting and maintain certain records relating to exports and make these available to the FDA for inspection, if required. 
Human Cells, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products 
Integra distributes medical devices derived from human tissue (demineralized bone tissue). The FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing, or consisting of, human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient. Examples include bone, ligament, skin and cornea. 
Some HCT/Ps fall within the definition of a biological product, medical device or drug regulated under the FD&C Act. These biologic, device or drug HCT/Ps must comply both with the requirements exclusively applicable to HCT/Ps and, in addition, with requirements applicable to biologics, devices or drugs, including premarket clearance or approval from the FDA. 
Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as “361” HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, Good Tissue Practice when processing, storing, labeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting. 
The American Association of Tissue Banks (“AATB”) has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Compliance with these standards is a requirement in order to become an AATB-accredited tissue establishment. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations. We are licensed or have permits for tissue banking in California, Florida, New York and Maryland. 
National Organ Transplant Act. Procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant Act (“NOTA”), which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. We reimburse tissue banks for their expenses associated with the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human tissue that they provide to us for processing. We include in our pricing structure amounts paid to tissue banks to reimburse them for their expenses associated with the recovery and transportation of the tissue, in addition to certain costs associated with processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the tissue, marketing and medical education expenses, and costs associated with development of tissue processing technologies. NOTA payment allowances may be interpreted to limit the amount of costs and expenses that we may recover in our pricing for our products, thereby reducing our future revenue and profitability. 
Medical Device Regulations
We also are required to register with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. As such, our manufacturing sites are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA's Quality System Regulations. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain our documents in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and control activities. Further, we are required to comply with various FDA requirements and other legal requirements for labeling and promotion. If the FDA believes that a company is not in compliance with applicable regulations, it may issue a warning letter, institute proceedings to detain or seize products, issue a recall order, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against that company, its officers or its employees and may recommend criminal prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Medical device regulations also are in effect in many of the countries in which we do business outside the United States. These laws range from comprehensive medical device approval and Quality System requirements for some or all of our medical device 
8

products to simpler requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. Under the European Union Medical Device Directive, medical devices must meet the Medical Device Directive standards and receive CE Mark Certification prior to marketing in the European Union (the “EU”). CE Mark Certification requires a comprehensive quality system program, technical documentation and data on the product, which are then reviewed by a Notified Body. A Notified Body is an organization designated by the national governments of the European Union member states to make independent judgments about whether a product complies with the requirements established by each CE marking directive. The Medical Device Directive, ISO 9000 series and ISO 13485 are recognized international quality standards that are designed to ensure that we develop and manufacture quality medical devices. Other countries are also instituting regulations regarding medical devices or interpreting and enforcing existing regulations more strictly. Compliance with these regulations requires extensive documentation and clinical reports for all of our products, revisions to labeling, and other requirements such as facility inspections to comply with the registration requirements. A recognized Notified Body audits our facilities annually to verify our compliance with the ISO 13485 Quality System standard. 
Certain countries, as well as the EU, have issued regulations that govern products that contain materials derived from animal sources. Regulatory authorities are particularly concerned with materials infected with the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE”), otherwise known as mad cow disease. These regulations affect our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products, hernia repair products, biomaterial products for the spine, nerve and tendon repair products and certain other products, all of which contain material derived from bovine tissue. Although we take great care to provide that our products are safe and free of agents that can cause disease, products that contain materials derived from animals, including our products, may become subject to additional regulation, or even be banned in certain countries, because of concern over the potential for prion transmission. Significant new regulations, a ban of our products, or a movement away from bovine-derived products because of an outbreak of BSE could have a material adverse effect on our current business or our ability to expand our business. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Certain of our products contain materials derived from animal sources and may become subject to additional regulation.” 
Postmarket Requirements. After a device is cleared or approved for commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include the FDA Quality System Regulations which cover the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of medical devices; the FDA's general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or 'off-label' uses; the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which require manufacturers to report recalls and field corrective actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act. 
Other regulations
Anti-Bribery Laws. In the United States, we are subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws that regulate the means by which companies in the health care industry may market their products to hospitals and health care professionals and may compete by discounting the prices of their products. Similar anti-bribery laws exist in many of the countries in which we sell our products outside of the United States, as well as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (which addresses the activities of U.S. companies in foreign markets). Our products also are subject to regulation regarding reimbursement, and U.S. healthcare laws apply when a customer submits a claim for a product that is reimbursed under a federally funded healthcare program. These global laws require that we exercise care in designing our sales and marketing practices, including involving interactions with healthcare professionals, and customer discount arrangements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Oversight of the medical device industry might affect the manner in which we may sell medical devices and compete in the marketplace.” 

Import-export. Our international operations subject us to laws regarding sanctioned countries, entities and persons, customs, and import-export. Among other things, these laws restrict, and in some cases can prevent, United States companies from directly or indirectly selling goods, technology or services to people or entities in certain countries. In addition, these laws require that we exercise care in our business dealings with entities in and from foreign countries. 
Hazardous materials. Our research, development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials. We are subject to country-specific, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products. We believe that our environmental, health and safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by the controlling laws and regulations. However, risk of accidental releases or injury from these materials is possible. These risks are managed to minimize or eliminate associated business impacts. In the event of this type of accident, we could be held liable for damages that may result, and any liability could exceed our resources. We could be subject to a regulatory shutdown of a facility that could prevent the distribution and sale of products manufactured there for a significant period of time, and we could suffer a casualty loss that could require a 
9

shutdown of the facility in order to repair it, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business. Although we continuously strive to maintain full compliance with respect to all applicable global environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could incur substantial costs to fully comply with future laws and regulations, and our operations, business or assets may be negatively affected. Furthermore, global environmental, health and safety compliance is an ongoing process. Integra has compliance procedures in place for compliance with Employee Health & Safety laws, driven by a centrally led organizational structure that ensures proper implementation, which is essential to our overall business objectives. 
In addition to the above regulations, we are, and may be, subject to regulation under country-specific federal and state laws, including, but not limited to, requirements regarding record keeping, and the maintenance of personal information, including personal health information. As a public company, we are subject to the securities laws and regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We also are subject to other present, and could be subject to possible future, local, state, federal and foreign regulations. 
Third-Party Reimbursement. Healthcare providers that purchase medical devices generally rely on third-party payors, including, in the United States, the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payors, such as indemnity insurers, employer group health insurance programs and managed care plans, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the products. As a result, demand for our products is and will continue to be dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors. The manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type of payor involved and the setting in which the product is furnished and utilized. Reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors may be subject to periodic adjustments as a result of legislative, regulatory and policy changes, as well as budgetary pressures. Possible reductions in, or eliminations of, coverage or reimbursement by third-party payors, or denial of, or provision of uneconomical reimbursement for new products may affect our customers' revenue and ability to purchase our products. Any changes in the healthcare regulatory, payment or enforcement landscape relative to our customers' healthcare services has the potential to significantly affect our operations and revenue. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
We seek patent and trademark protection for our key technology, products and product improvements, both in the United States and in selected foreign countries. When determined appropriate, we have enforced and plan to continue to enforce and defend our patent and trademark rights. In general, however, we do not rely solely on our patent and trademark estate to provide us with any significant competitive advantages as it relates to our existing product lines. We also rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position. In an effort to protect our trade secrets, we have a policy of requiring our employees, consultants and advisors to execute proprietary information and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements also provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of their relationship with us must be kept confidential, except in specified circumstances.

MAYFIELD® is a registered trademark of SM USA, Inc., and is used by Integra under license.
EMPLOYEES 
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 3,700 employees engaged in production and production support for warehouse, engineering and facilities, quality assurance, quality control, research and development, regulatory and clinical affairs, sales, marketing, administration and finance. Except for certain employees at our facilities in France and Mexico, none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS 
Financial information about our geographical areas is set forth under “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Geographic Product Revenues and Operations” and in our financial statements Note 15, Segment and Geographic Information, to our consolidated financial statements.

SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS 
In general, raw materials essential to our businesses are readily available from multiple sources. For reasons of quality assurance, availability, or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. Our policy is to maintain sufficient inventory of components so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time. 
Certain of our products, including our dermal regeneration products, duraplasty products, wound care products, bone void fillers, nerve and tendon repair products and certain other products, contain material derived from bovine tissue. We take great care to provide that our products are safe and free of agents that can cause disease. In particular, the collagen used in the products that Integra manufactures is derived either from the deep flexor tendon of cattle less than 24 months old from New Zealand, a country that has never had a reported case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or from the United States or from fetal dermis. The World Health Organization classifies different types of cattle tissue for relative risk of BSE transmission. Deep flexor tendon and fetal bovine skin are in the lowest-risk category for BSE transmission, and is therefore considered to have a negligible risk of containing the agent that causes BSE. 
SEASONALITY 
Revenues during our fourth quarter tend to be stronger than other quarters because many hospitals increase their purchases of our products during the fourth quarter to coincide with the end of their budget cycles in the U.S. In general, our first quarter usually has lower revenues than the preceding fourth quarter, the second and third quarters have higher revenues than the first quarter, and the fourth quarter revenues are the highest in the year.
