Corporate History
 
Golden Developing Solutions, Inc. (the “Company”) is developing an online retail business for CBD, hemp oil and health/wellness related products. Through our online retail business, we will offer a broad range of price-competitive products, including traditional vitamins, supplements, and CBD based tinctures, vapes, softgels, among other products.
 
We will sell our products and services through our Internet website (the "Website"). The Company is developing an online store whose merchandise includes hemp related products, CBD (Cannabidiol) related products and additional products focusing on health and lifestyle.
 
Initially, we intend to carry in excess of 10 products from two suppliers. We intend to place directed advertising throughout the online store. Advertising will originate through internet or direct-advertising sales by the Company. The company may also use social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram in an effort to attract customers with product specific advertisements or posts.
 
As an online retail store operating with distribution hub, we will be able to rapidly scale our products and services with minimal marginal costs. Each additional brand, category or product that we add to our platform adds negligible server hosting costs. It also allows us to have a virtual presence and exposure to every regulated cannabis market without establishing a costly physical presence in each state. This minimizes the costs of scaling and required capital while, at the same time, offering a direct role in the cannabis industry without ever touching the plant itself.
 
We are a startup company in the cannabis industry. Our focus is to create online sales and marketing initiatives to build a dominate brand. Our oil and extracts division will focus on online sales of formulated CBD / hemp oil tinctures, softgels, capsules. We have our Website under development and anticipate to be online in the next few months. We are in the process of acquiring trademarks relative to our products. Agreements with raw material suppliers and related products have been obtained. All supply will come domestically with white label agreements when needed. Online Marketing program in place to drive fast paced growth plan in line with industry. Orders will be handled online and shipped via appropriate carriers from our inventory in leased warehouse. Drop shipping may be used during initial launch phases. Customers for CBD/hemp products expect the highest of quality and consistency and pricing is based on those levels. We expect to be price and quality competitive on the higher end of that scale. All product quality is 100% customer satisfaction guaranteed and products not deemed to be of quality can be returned for a refund. Quality and consistency of quality are needed to avoid returned product issues which could result in financial liability.
