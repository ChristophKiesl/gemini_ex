Overview 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company seeking to advance targeted medicines for oncology and other unmet medical needs.  Our pipeline of product candidates under development includes our lead candidate tivozanib for use in oncology and other indications; ficlatuzumab, a hepatocyte growth factor, or HGF, inhibitory antibody, as a potential treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or HNSCC, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and pancreatic cancer; AV-203, an anti-ErbB3 monoclonal antibody, as a potential oncology treatment; AV-380, a humanized IgG1 inhibitory monoclonal antibody targeting growth differentiation factor 15, or GDF15, a divergent member of the TGF-ß family, for the potential treatment of cancer cachexia; and AV-353, which targets the Notch 3 pathway. 
 We are working to develop and commercialize tivozanib in North America as a treatment for relapsed or refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma, or RCC. We have sublicensed tivozanib, marketed under the brand name FOTIVDA®, in Europe and other territories outside of North America. Through our partner, EUSA Pharma (UK) Limited, or EUSA, tivozanib is approved in the European Union, or EU, as well as the United Kingdom, Norway, Iceland and New Zealand, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with RCC and for adult patients who are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, or VEGFR, and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for RCC.  We also have clinical collaborations to study tivozanib in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors in RCC and in hepatocellular carcinoma, or HCC.
 We are seeking to commercialize our oncology pipeline of products and product candidates in North America while leveraging partnerships to support development and commercialization of our pipeline in other geographies. 
 Going Concern 
 We have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. To continue as a going concern, we must secure additional funding to support our current operating plan. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $47.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Based on our available cash resources, we do not have sufficient cash on hand to fund our current operations for more than twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect that, in order to obtain additional funding, we will need to receive additional milestone payments and royalties from our partners and / or complete additional public or private financings of debt or equity. We may also seek to procure additional funds through future arrangements with collaborators, licensees or other third parties, and these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates. We may not receive milestone payments or be able to complete financings or enter into third-party arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. For more information, refer to Part II, Item 7 of this report under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity and Going Concern” below and Note 1, “—Liquidity and Going Concern” of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Product Candidates 
 The following summarizes our product candidates as of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, each of which is described in further detail below:
Tivozanib 
 Our 
pipeline includes our lead candidate tivozanib, an oral, once-daily, VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI. Tivozanib is a potent, selective and long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities, potentially resulting in improved efficacy and minimal need for dose modifications. Tivozanib has been investigated in several tumor types, including renal cell, hepatocellular, colorectal, breast and ovarian cancers. We have exclusive rights to develop and commercialize tivozanib in oncology in all countries outside of Asia and the Middle East under a license from Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. (formerly Kirin Brewery Co., Ltd.), or KKC. We have sublicensed to EUSA the right to develop and commercialize tivozanib in our licensed territories outside of North America, including Europe (excluding Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States), Latin America (excluding Mexico), Africa and Australasia. The EUSA sublicense excludes non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. On August 1, 2019, KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, excluding the rights that we sublicensed to EUSA. We are currently executing studies with tivozanib both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of RCC and HCC.

Clinical Development of Tivozanib in RCC
First-Line Phase 3 Trial (TIVO-1): We conducted the TIVO-1 trial, a global phase 3 clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of tivozanib with sorafenib, an approved therapy, for the first-line treatment of RCC. The trial met its primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival, or PFS, with a median PFS in the tivozanib arm of 11.9 months compared with 9.1 months in the sorafenib arm.  The trial also showed significant improvement in overall response rate, or ORR, of 33.1% for tivozanib versus 23.3% for sorafenib. The trial showed a favorable tolerability profile for tivozanib, as evidenced by fewer dose interruptions and dose reductions than sorafenib. However, the trial showed a non-statistically significant trend favoring the sorafenib treatment group in overall survival, or OS, in the intent to treat population. The protocol-specified final OS analysis at 24 months since the last patient enrolled showed a median OS for the tivozanib arm of 28.8 months versus a median OS for the sorafenib arm of 29.3 months (hazard ratio (HR)=1.245, p=0.105). An OS hazard ratio assesses the relative risk of death for the entirety of the data set and the median OS is a point in time value of the OS when half of the patients within each arm are still alive. Subsequently, in connection with EUSA’s application for the use of tivozanib as a first-line treatment for RCC to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in February 2016, which was approved in August 2017 and is further discussed below, the survival status of additional patients was taken into account and the updated median OS for the tivozanib arm was 28.2 months and the updated median OS for the sorafenib arm was 30.8 months (HR=1.147, p=0.276). We believe that an imbalance in subsequent therapy, which was more prevalent in patients treated in certain countries such as Russia and the Ukraine, combined with the significant activity seen with tivozanib treatment following sorafenib contributed to the discordance in the efficacy results in the TIVO-1 trial between the PFS and ORR benefit, which significantly favored tivozanib, and the OS, which trended in favor of sorafenib. In 2012, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, seeking U.S. marketing approval for tivozanib.  In June 2013, the FDA issued a complete response letter, which we refer to as the 2013 CRL, informing us that it would not approve tivozanib for the first-line treatment of RCC based solely on the data from this single pivotal trial (TIVO-1), and recommended that we perform an additional clinical trial adequately sized to assure the FDA that tivozanib does not adversely affect OS.
 Second-Line TIVO-1 Extension Study - One-sided crossover from sorafenib to tivozanib (Study 902): We completed a TIVO-1 extension study, which we refer to as the 902 trial, in which patients with RCC received tivozanib as second-line treatment subsequent to disease progression on the sorafenib treatment arm in the TIVO-1 first-line RCC trial. We presented the results at the 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, Annual Meeting. In March 2018, long-term follow-up results from the 902 trial were published in the European Journal of Cancer under the title “Efficacy of Tivozanib Treatment after Sorafenib in Patients with Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma: Crossover of a Phase 3 Study,” reporting a median PFS of 11.0 months, a median OS of 21.6 months and an 18% ORR, further supporting the rationale for our current phase 3 TIVO-3 trial discussed below.  
 Third-Line and Fourth-Line Phase 3 Trial (TIVO-3): In May 2016, we initiated enrollment in a phase 3 randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label clinical trial comparing tivozanib to an approved therapy, sorafenib (Nexavar®) as a third- and fourth-line treatment for RCC, which we refer to as the TIVO-3 trial. The TIVO-3 trial is the first positive phase 3 study in the third- and fourth-line treatment of patients with RCC as well as the first phase 3 study in RCC to investigate a predefined subpopulation of patients who received prior immunotherapy, an emerging standard of care for earlier lines of therapy. The trial enrolled a total of 350 patients and was designed to address the FDA’s concern about the negative OS trend in TIVO-1. TIVO-3, together with the previously completed TIVO-1 and 902 trials of tivozanib in the first-line and second-line treatment of RCC, is designed to support a regulatory submission of tivozanib in the United States as a treatment for RCC in relapsed or refractory patients. Our TIVO-3 trial design, which we reviewed with the FDA, provides for a randomized, controlled, multi-center, open-label phase 3 clinical trial, with subjects randomized 1:1 to receive either tivozanib or sorafenib. Subjects enrolled in the trial must have failed two systemic therapies, including a VEGFR TKI. Patients may have received prior immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint (PD-1) inhibitors, reflecting the evolving treatment landscape. The primary objective of the TIVO-3 trial is to show improved PFS. Secondary endpoints include OS, safety and ORR. The trial’s sites are located exclusively in North America and Europe. The TIVO-3 trial does not include a crossover design; accordingly, the protocol does not provide for patients who progress on one therapy to cross over to the other therapy. 
 On November 5, 2018, we announced that the TIVO-3 trial met its primary endpoint of improving PFS, with a median PFS in the tivozanib arm of 5.6 months compared with 3.9 months in the sorafenib arm. Tivozanib demonstrated a 44% improvement in median PFS and 27% reduction in risk of progression or death compared to sorafenib (HR=0.73, p=0.02). Approximately 26% of patients received checkpoint inhibitor therapy in earlier lines of treatment. Patients who received prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy had a 45% reduction in risk of progression or death. The secondary endpoint of ORR for patients receiving tivozanib was 18% compared to 8% for patients receiving sorafenib (p=0.02). Median duration of response in patients receiving tivozanib was not reached and in patients receiving sorafenib was 5.7 months. Tivozanib was generally better tolerated than sorafenib, with Grade 3 or higher adverse events consistent with those observed in previous tivozanib trials. Infrequent but severe adverse events reported in greater number in the tivozanib arm were thrombotic events similar to those observed in previous tivozanib studies. The most common adverse event in patients receiving tivozanib was hypertension, an adverse event known to reflect effective VEGF pathway inhibition, which has shown a correlation with better PFS outcomes.

The first interim analysis of the secondary endpoint of OS, which was not mature at the time of the final PFS analysis, favored sorafenib (HR=1.12, p=0.44). As a result, at a pre-NDA meeting in January 2019 with the FDA, the FDA recommended that we not submit an NDA for tivozanib at that time with the interim OS results from the TIVO-3 trial, as the interim OS results did not allay its concerns about a potential detriment in OS outlined in the 2013 CRL. Following this meeting, due to the longer-than-forecasted median OS in both the tivozanib and sorafenib arms, coupled with the FDA’s request for more mature OS data, we amended the planned August 2019 final OS analysis to become a second prespecified interim analysis. August 2019 marked two years from the last patient enrolled and approximately ten months from the data cut-off date for the first prespecified analysis. 
On August 15, 2019, we performed a second prespecified interim OS analysis, which showed an updated OS hazard ratio of 0.99 (p=0.95), estimating that tivozanib resulted in a 1% lower risk of death for patients in the trial relative to sorafenib. It showed a median OS for the tivozanib arm of 16.4 months versus 19.7 months for the sorafenib arm. Between the two prespecified interim data cut-off dates for the TIVO-3 trial, 16 additional OS events were reported on the tivozanib arm and 28 additional events were reported on the sorafenib arm, resulting in a total of 114 OS events on the tivozanib arm and 113 OS events on the sorafenib arm as of August 15, 2019. Twenty patients remained progression free on the tivozanib arm and two on the sorafenib arm, with a median duration on study of 32.5 months. 
 In November 2019, we announced that we had met with the FDA to discuss the results of the August 2019 interim OS analysis.  Based on its assessment of the totality of evidence presented to date, the FDA recommended that we not submit an NDA at that time. The FDA stated that it remained concerned about the results of TIVO-3 in the context of the overall development of tivozanib. The FDA noted that the current interim OS HR results coupled with the median OS, which was longer for sorafenib than tivozanib in the August 2019 interim OS analysis, did not abrogate their concerns over the OS detriment observed in the TIVO-1 trial.  In addition, the FDA expressed concern that the OS results may worsen with the final analysis at 263 events.  We informed the FDA that given the changes in the landscape for first-line treatment of RCC, a single agent TKI controlled trial such as TIVO-1 was no longer relevant, and as a result, we intend to narrow the proposed indication for tivozanib to relapsed or refractory RCC. The FDA advised us that a discussion with the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee, or ODAC, will likely be required if we choose to submit an NDA. The FDA also advised us that if we wished to proceed with a revised OS analysis in June 2020, we should submit an updated statistical analysis plan, or SAP, with a planned OS update based on the projected number of events at that time.  In December 2019, we submitted the updated SAP to the FDA for the final OS analysis. We are planning to submit an NDA at the end of the first quarter of 2020.  We expect to report the final OS analysis by June 2020 based on a May 1, 2020 cutoff, at which point we estimate the study will have reached approximately 263 OS events, as discussed with the FDA. We and the FDA agreed that if the final analysis yielded an OS hazard ratio above 1.00, we will withdraw our NDA.
 On February 16, 2019, the topline data from the TIVO-3 trial was presented at the 2019 ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium and on June 3, 2019, data from the subgroup analysis of the TIVO-3 trial was presented at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting. On November 16, 2019, the updated OS data, including subgroup data, from the August 2019 interim OS analysis was presented at the 2019 International Kidney Cancer Symposium.  In December 2019, previously reported data from the TIVO-3 trial was published in The Lancet Oncology.
 RCC PD-1 Combination Trial with Opdivo® (TiNivo): In March 2017, we initiated enrollment in a phase 1b/2 clinical trial of tivozanib in combination with Opdivo (nivolumab), an immune checkpoint (PD-1) inhibitor, in the first-line and the second-line treatment of RCC, which we refer to as the TiNivo trial. The TiNivo trial enrolled a total of 28 patients. We sponsored the trial, for which Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, supplied nivolumab. The TiNivo trial was led by the Institut Gustave Roussy in Paris under the direction of Professor Bernard Escudier, MD, Chairman of the Genitourinary Oncology Committee. The phase 1b portion of the TiNivo trial enrolled six patients and demonstrated that the combination of tivozanib and nivolumab was able to be dosed at the full dose and schedule of single agent tivozanib, with no dose limiting toxicities observed.  
 The phase 2 portion of the trial, which enrolled an additional 22 patients, was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of the full dose and schedule of the combination of tivozanib (1.5 mg daily for 21 days, followed by seven days off treatment) and nivolumab (240 mg every two weeks) as established in the phase 1b portion of the study. On September 30, 2019, we presented final results at the European Society for Medical Oncology, or ESMO, 2019 Congress.  The final results showed that the combination required few dose reductions and showed additive or synergistic activity for ORR and PFS in both treatment naïve and previously treated patients with RCC. Out of 25 patients who were treated with the full dose and schedule of oral tivozanib in combination with intravenous nivolumab, thirteen (52%) had received at least one prior systemic therapy, including two (8%) that had received prior PD-1 therapy, and twelve (48%) that were treatment naïve. The overall median PFS for the 25 patients was 18.9 months.  The median PFS for the twelve previously untreated patients was 18.5 months and the median PFS for the thirteen previously treated patients had not yet been achieved as of the final data cut-off date of August 27, 2019. An ORR was observed in 14 patients (56%) (complete response plus partial response), including one treatment naïve patient (4%) achieving a complete response, and a disease control rate (complete response plus partial response plus stable disease) was observed in 24 patients (96%). Of the two patients (8%) who received prior PD-1 therapy, one achieved a partial response and the other achieved stable disease. Treatment-

related Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 80% of patients, the most common of which was hypertension, and only 17% of patients required a dose reduction.
Commercialization of Tivozanib in RCC
First-Line Approval in Europe: In February 2016, EUSA submitted an application for the use of tivozanib as a first-line treatment for RCC to the EMA based on the data from our TIVO-1 clinical trial, one phase 1 trial and two phase 2 trials in RCC. In June 2017, following an oral explanation, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, which is the scientific committee of the EMA, issued an opinion recommending tivozanib for approval. In August 2017, the European Commission granted marketing authorization to EUSA for tivozanib in all 28 countries of the EU (which included the United Kingdom at that time), Norway and Iceland.  Tivozanib is sold under the brand name FOTIVDA, and is approved for the first-line treatment of adult patients with RCC and for those who are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for RCC.  
 In January 2019, we were informed by EUSA that the CHMP requested the topline data results from our TIVO-3 trial for review at the CHMP’s
 January 2019 plenary meeting under its post-authorization monitoring procedures. Subsequently, EUSA informed us that the CHMP requested additional data analysis from our TIVO-3 trial. Following its review of these data analyses, the CHMP has determined that the analyses of various factors that may have impacted the preliminary OS data from our TIVO-3 trial do not fully explain the discordance between the PFS results (HR=0.73, p=0.02) and the preliminary OS results (HR=1.12, p=0.44) in the TIVO-3 trial, and that more mature OS data is required prior to drawing a conclusion. Similar to the FDA, the CHMP accepted the proposal to conduct an additional interim OS analysis in August 2019. The CHMP further provided that regulatory action should be considered if the August 2019 interim OS analysis confirmed a negative trend in OS. We provided the updated OS analysis, showing a hazard ratio of 0.99 (p=0.95), which estimates that tivozanib resulted in a 1% lower risk of death for patients in the trial relative to sorafenib, to EUSA in September 2019 for their discussions with the CHMP. As of the date of this filing, the CHMP has taken no further regulatory action. 
 In the updated Clinical Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of RCC by the ESMO published in February 2019, tivozanib has been added as a first-line treatment for patients with good or intermediate risk and as a second-line treatment for patients following first-line TKIs.
 Commercial Launch of FOTIVDA: EUSA has received reimbursement approval for and commercially launched FOTIVDA in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Spain as well as in some additional non-EU5 countries. In February 2018, November 2018 and February 2019, EUSA obtained reimbursement approvals from the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or the NICE, the German Federal Association of the Statutory Health Insurances, or GKV-SV, and Spain’s Ministry of Health, Consumer Affairs and Social Welfare, or MSCBS, respectively, for the first-line treatment of RCC. EUSA is working to secure reimbursement approval in and commercially launch FOTIVDA in additional European countries.
 First-Line Approval in New Zealand:  In July 2019, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority approved FOTIVDA for the first-line treatment of adult patients with RCC and for adult patients who are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for RCC. 
 Clinical Development of Tivozanib in HCC
NCCN-AVEO Phase 1b/2 Trial.  In February 2020, final results from a multicenter, investigator-sponsored phase 1b/2 clinical trial of tivozanib in previously untreated patients with advanced, unresectable HCC were published in the British Journal of Cancer under the title, “A Multicentre Phase 1b/2 Study of Tivozanib in Patients with Advanced Inoperable Hepatocellular Carcinoma.” The trial was led by the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center under the direction of Dr. Renuka Iyer and was approved and funded by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Oncology Research Program from general research support provided by us.  The trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tivozanib in advanced HCC, and enrolled a total of 27 patients at three trial sites. In the phase 1b portion of the trial, which used a modified 3 + 3 dose escalation design, 8 patients were dosed with tivozanib starting at 1.0 mg or 1.5 mg daily for 21 days followed by 7 days off treatment. No dose-limiting toxicities were seen in cycle one in patients treated with 1.0 mg, and tivozanib at 1.0 mg daily was selected for the phase 2 expansion portion of the trial.  The phase 2 trial’s primary endpoint of median PFS and 24-week PFS probability were 24 weeks and 58%, respectively. Of 19 evaluable patients in the trial, a partial response was seen in 4 of 19 patients (21%) and stable disease in 8 of 19 patients (42%), for a disease control rate of 63%. Median OS was 9.0 months. A significant decrease in soluble plasma VEGFR-2 was also observed, suggesting adequate target engagement. There were no significant changes in hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral load during study treatment and adverse events were consistent with those observed in previous tivozanib trials.

HCC PD-L1 Combination Trial with IMFINZI® (DEDUCTIVE): In September 2019, we opened enrollment in an open-label, multi-center, randomized phase1b/2 clinical trial of tivozanib in combination with IMFINZI (durvalumab), a human monoclonal antibody directed against programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced, unresectable HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy, which we refer to as the DEDUCTIVE trial. Pursuant to the clinical supply agreement that we entered into with a wholly-owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca PLC, or AstraZeneca, in December 2018, we serve as the study sponsor; each party contributes the clinical supply of its study drug; key decisions are made by both parties by consensus; and external study costs are otherwise shared equally. The DEDUCTIVE trial is being led by the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center under the direction of Dr. Iyer. The trial is expected to enroll up to 42 patients. The phase 1b portion of the trial will primarily evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicity, maximum tolerated dose and preliminary anti-tumor activity of tivozanib in combination with durvalumab starting with 1.0 mg of tivozanib for 21 days followed by seven days off treatment together with 1,500 mg of durvalumab every 28 days.  Assuming favorable results from the phase 1b portion of the trial, we intend to enroll 30 patients in a phase 2 expansion trial at the dose and schedule designated in the phase 1b portion. The primary outcome measure of the DEDUCTIVE trial is incidence of treatment emergent adverse events and the secondary outcome measures include ORR, PFS and OS.
 Clinical Development of Tivozanib in Ovarian Cancer
 On June 1, 2019, Dr. Wendy Swetzig at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine presented data at the 2019 ASCO Annual Meeting from an investigator-sponsored phase 2 clinical trial of tivozanib in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, including fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.  The trial was one of several studies funded by a grant we provided to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.  The trial was designed to measure the safety and activity of tivozanib in ovarian cancer and enrolled a total of 31 patients, 30 of which were treated with tivozanib. With four patients showing a partial response and twelve patients with stable disease, the clinical benefit rate (partial response + stable disease) was reported to be 53.3%. The trial concluded that tivozanib is active in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, without substantial toxicity.
Ficlatuzumab
 Ficlatuzumab is a potent HGF inhibitory antibody. HGF is the sole known ligand of the c-Met receptor, which is believed to trigger many activities that are involved in cancer development and metastasis. We have partnered with Biodesix, Inc., or Biodesix, under a worldwide Co-Development and Collaboration Agreement, or the Biodesix Agreement, to develop and commercialize ficlatuzumab. Under the Biodesix Agreement, we and Biodesix each contribute half of the development costs of ficlatuzumab.
 Development in HNSCC. We and Biodesix funded an investigator-sponsored phase 1 clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with cetuximab in HNSCC.  In June 2017, preliminary results from the phase 1 trial were presented at the 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting. The trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab in patients with cetuximab-resistant, metastatic HNSCC demonstrated activity with an overall response rate of 17% (two partial responses out of twelve patients), a disease control rate of 67% and prolonged PFS and OS compared to historical controls. A randomized, phase 2, multicenter, investigator-initiated trial in ERBITUX® (cetuximab) refractory patients to confirm these findings was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2017 under the direction of Julie E. Bauman, MD, MPH, Chief, Division of Hematology/Oncology at the University of Arizona Cancer Center. The phase 2 trial is designed to enroll approximately 60 patients randomized to receive either ficlatuzumab alone or ficlatuzumab and cetuximab.
 Development in AML.  We and Biodesix funded an investigator-sponsored phase 1b/2 clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with cytarabine in AML, which we refer to as the CyFi-1 trial, which showed a 50% complete response rate in the 18 primary refractory AML patients enrolled in the trial and an acceptable tolerability profile. In April 2019, data from the study was presented at the 2019 American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting. The maximum tolerated dose was 20 mg/kg of ficlatuzumab on day 1 followed by 2 g/m2 cytarabine daily on days 2 through 7. Of the 18 AML patients enrolled in the study, all had disease that was refractory to initial treatment, 17 were evaluable and nine achieved a complete response. The most frequent Grade 3/4 treatment emergent adverse events observed were febrile neutropenia, liver function test abnormalities, and electrolyte disturbance. There was one death from sepsis and multi-organ failure that was determined to be disease-related, and one patient withdrew from the study due to grade 4 gastrointestinal bleed, determined to likely be ficlatuzumab related.
 Based on the encouraging findings from the CyFi-1 trial, we and Biodesix initiated a randomized phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ficlatuzumab in combination with high-dose cytarabine versus high-dose cytarabine alone in patients with AML, which we refer to as the CyFi-2 trial. We serve as the study sponsor for the CyFi-2 trial, which is expected to enroll up to 60 patients with AML who failed induction chemotherapy or who achieved a complete response but relapsed within one year. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either ficlatuzumab in combination with cytarabine or cytarabine alone at the doses and schedules determined in the CyFi-1 trial. The primary endpoint of the CyFi-2 trial is complete response rate and the secondary endpoints include safety, disease-free survival and OS.

Development in pancreatic cancer.  We and Biodesix funded an investigator-sponsored phase 1b/2 clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer.  The trial was initiated in December 2017 to test the safety and tolerability of ficlatuzumab when combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in previously untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal cancer, or PDAC.  In January 2020, results from the phase 1b portion of the trial were presented at the 2020 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium.  The trial, which was based on preclinical findings demonstrating a synergistic effect of the combination in a preclinical model of PDAC, is designed to determine maximum tolerated dose of ficlatuzumab when combined with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Secondary outcome measures include response rate and PFS. A total of 24 patients enrolled in the trial, which was conducted under the direction of Kimberly Perez, M.D. at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.  The average number of 28-day treatment cycles received was 7.5 (range 1-15), with three patients remaining on active treatment at the end of the trial. The combination showed a 29% partial response rate and a 92% disease control rate (partial response and stable disease), which was promising relative to data observed for gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone. Treatment with this regimen was associated with significant hypoalbuminemia and edema, and therefore a follow-up safety study is under consideration to evaluate ficlatuzumab in combination with an alternate cytotoxic regimen.
 We continue to evaluate additional opportunities for the further clinical development of ficlatuzumab. The expansion of the ficlatuzumab clinical program, beyond what we are currently committed to, will require additional manufacturing efforts and costs. 
 AV-203
 AV-203 is a potent anti-ErbB3 (also known as HER3) specific monoclonal antibody with high ErbB3 affinity. We have observed potent anti-tumor activity in mouse models. AV-203 selectively inhibits the activity of the ErbB3 receptor, and our preclinical studies suggest that neuregulin-1 (also known as heregulin), or NRG1, levels predict AV-203 anti-tumor activity. We have completed a phase 1 dose escalation trial of AV-203, which established a recommended phase 2 dose, demonstrated good tolerability and promising early signs of activity, and reached the maximum planned dose of AV-203 monotherapy. 
 We have partnered with CANbridge Life Sciences Ltd., or CANbridge, to develop, manufacture and commercialize AV-203 in all countries outside of North America. We have retained the North American rights to AV-203. CANbridge’s obligations include conducting and funding clinical development of AV-203 through phase 2 proof-of-concept in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, or ESCC, or another agreed upon indication.  Following proof-of-concept, we may decide to participate in later-stage worldwide development efforts.  In December 2017, CANbridge filed an investigational new drug, or IND, application in China seeking regulatory authorization to initiate clinical trials of AV-203, which CANbridge refers to as CAN017, in ESCC. In August 2018, the National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA (formerly the China Food and Drug Administration) approved this IND application. In March 2020, CANbridge advised us that it is evaluating NRG1 Fusion biomarker directed development plans with the potential to initiate a clinical study in 2021. NRG1 Fusions, which are certain alterations in the NRG1 gene that may cause increased levels of the growth factor NRG1, are a potential biomarker for response to AV-203 in various tumor types.
 AV-380 
 AV-380 is a potent humanized IgG1 inhibitory monoclonal antibody targeting GDF15, a divergent member of the TGF-ß family, for the potential treatment or prevention of cachexia. Cachexia is defined as a multi-factorial syndrome of involuntary weight loss characterized by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment. It is estimated that cachexia affects approximately 9 million individuals in North America, Europe and Japan (J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle 2010). Cachexia is associated with various cancers as well as chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, anorexia nervosa and other diseases. AV-380 focuses on a significant area of unmet patient need. It is estimated that approximately 30% of all cancer patients die due to cachexia and over half of cancer patients who die do so with cachexia present (J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle 2010). 
 We believe that AV-380 represents a unique approach to treating cachexia because it has been demonstrated in preclinical studies to address key underlying mechanisms of the syndrome. We have established preclinical proof-of-concept for GDF15 as a key driver of cachexia by demonstrating, in animal models, that the administration of GDF15 induces cachexia, and that inhibition of GDF15 reverses cachexia and provides a potential indication of a survival benefit. We have demonstrated preclinical proof-of-concept for AV-380 in multiple cancer cachexia models, completed cell line development and manufactured cGMP lots for potential use in clinical trials. In connection with the AV-380 program, we have in-licensed certain patents and patent applications from St. Vincent’s Hospital Sydney Limited in Sydney, Australia, which we refer to as St. Vincent’s.
 In August 2015, we entered into a license agreement, which we refer to as the Novartis Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., or Novartis, the exclusive right to develop and commercialize AV-380 and our related antibodies worldwide. In June 2019, Novartis notified us that it would be terminating the Novartis Agreement, without cause, 
 
11

following a change in strategic direction at Novartis.  In August 2018, we regained worldwide rights to the AV-380 program and in 2019, we initiated preclinical toxicology studies to support a potential IND filing with the FDA in the second half of 2020.
 AV-353
 AV-353 is a potent inhibitory antibody specific to Notch 3. The Notch 3 pathway is important in cell-to-cell communication involving gene regulation mechanisms that control multiple cell differentiation processes during the entire life cycle. Scientific literature has implicated the Notch 3 receptor pathway in multiple diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, and neurodegenerative conditions. We are currently evaluating options to develop AV-353. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive, and our future success depends on our ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the design, development and commercialization of product candidates. Our corporate objective is to design, develop and commercialize new products with superior efficacy, convenience, tolerability and safety. We expect any product candidate that we commercialize, either independently or with our strategic partners, will compete with existing, market-leading products. 
 There are many companies focused on the development of small molecules and antibodies for cancer treatment. Our core competitors include pharmaceutical and biotech organizations, as well as academic research institutions, clinical research laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities in the same therapeutic area. Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Additionally, many competitors have greater experience in product discovery and development, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, and commercialization capabilities, which may provide them with a competitive advantage.
 We believe that our ability to compete will depend on our ability to execute on the following objectives:
  
• | design, develop and commercialize products that are superior to other products in the market in terms of, among other things, safety, efficacy, convenience, or price;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our processes and product candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain required regulatory approvals;
--+--------------------------------------


• | obtain favorable reimbursement, formulary and guideline status; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | collaborate with others in the design, development and commercialization of our products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Established competitors may invest heavily to discover and develop novel compounds that could make our product candidates obsolete. In addition, any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability and/or safety in order to obtain approval, to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful. If we are not able to compete effectively, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.
 Tivozanib 
 The competitive landscape and treatment regimens for RCC and HCC continue to rapidly evolve, particularly given the entrance of immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapies and the potential entrance of immune checkpoint inhibitor and VEGFR TKI combination therapies into the RCC treatment landscape. The utilization of such regimens may affect sequencing of certain drugs and combinations across different lines of therapy. Additionally, there are several therapies in clinical development for RCC and HCC that may alter the competitive landscape for the treatment of these cancers. As such, it is difficult to predict how these changes will inform our perspective on the key competitors of tivozanib in RCC and HCC in the future.  
 We believe the key competitors for tivozanib in relapsed or refractory RCC include the following FDA-approved treatments: Cabometyx (cabozantinib), marketed by Exelixis, Inc., or Exelixis; Afinitor (everolimus) marketed by Novartis; Inlyta (axitinib), marketed by Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer; Opdivo (nivolumab), marketed by BMS; and Nexavar (sorafenib), marketed by Bayer Healthcare AG, or Bayer, all as single-agent therapies, along with the combination of Lenvima (lenvatinib), marketed by Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, and Novartis’ Afinitor (everolimus).  In addition, other FDA-approved treatments for advanced RCC in the first line and/or subsequent lines of therapy include the combinations of Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Pfizer’s Inlyta (axitinib); BMS’s Yervoy (ipilimumab) and Opdivo (nivolumab); and Pfizer’s Inlyta (axitinib) and Merck KGaA’s Bavencio (avelumab) as well as the single agents of Pfizer’s Sutent (sunitinib); Pfizer’s Torisel (temsirolimus); and Novartis’ Votrient (pazopanib).  Additionally, there are a number of therapies in clinical development for relapsed or refractory RCC, including Merck’s MK-6482 as a single agent; the combination of Calithera Biosciences, Inc.’s CB-938 and Exelixis’ Cabotmetyx (cabozantinib); and the combination of Merck’s PT-2977 and Exelixis’ Cabometyx (cabozantinib). 
 
12

We believe the key competitors for tivozanib in advanced HCC include the following FDA-approved treatments: Bayer’s Nexavar (sorafenib); Bayer’s Stivarga (regorafenib); Lenvima (lenatinib), marketed by Eisai Co., Ltd., or Eisai; Exelixis’ Cabometyx (cabozantinib); Cyramza (ramucirumab), marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly; BMS’s Opdivo (nivolumab); and Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab), all as single agents; as well as BMS’s Yervoy (ipilimumab) and Opdivo (nivolumab) in combination in the refractory setting. Recently, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, or Roche, reported results of its Phase 3 IMBRAVE150 clinical trial evaluating the combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab.  If approved, we believe this regimen may become a new standard of care in the first line treatment of HCC.  Additionally, there are a number of therapies in clinical development for advanced HCC and it is difficult to predict which will be the key competitors to tivozanib in this indication. 
 Ficlatuzumab
 We believe the products that currently compete with ficlatuzumab are primarily those that exclusively target the HGF/c-Met pathway as various phase 3 trials of agents that non-exclusively target the HGF/c-Met pathway were stopped due to a lack of efficacy or failure to meet their primary endpoints. We believe the only other agent that exclusively targets this pathway is Eli Lilly’s emibetuzumab, currently in phase 2 trials. 
 Other FDA-approved treatments or therapies in clinical development which target the HGF/c-Met pathway, though not exclusively, include Pfizer’s PF-2341066 (Xalkori, crizotinib); Exelixis’ XL-184 (Cometriq/Cabometyx, cabozantinib); Mirati Therapeutics, Inc.’s glesatinib; Incyte’s and Novartis’ INCB-028060; Amgen’s and BioPharma’s AMG-337; Eli Lilly’s merestinib (LY2801653); AstraZeneca’s and Hutchison MediPharma Limited’s savolitinib; Merck KGaA’s tepotinib; AbbVie Inc.’s ABBV-299; and Betta Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.’s BPI-9016.  
 AV-203
 We believe the most direct competitors to our AV-203 program are monoclonal antibodies that specifically target the ErbB3 receptor. The clinical stage agents that are known to target ErbB3 receptors include Daiichi Sankyo, Inc.’s and Amgen Inc.’s patritumab (AMG-888); Merus N.V.’s MCLA-128; AstraZeneca’s sapitinib; Celldex Therapeutics Inc.’s CDX-3379; Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd.’s pirotinib; and Roche’s duligotuzumab. 
 AV-380 
 In the United States, a significant unmet need exists for patients afflicted with cachexia, as Megace is the only approved agent for the treatment of cachexia in patients with the diagnosis of AIDS.  A number of agents with unique mechanisms of action are in various stages of clinical development including NGM Bio’s NGM120; Regeneron’s REGN-1033; Novartis’ bimagrumab; Alder Biotherapeutic’s clazakizumab (ALD-518) and Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s OHR118 (cytoprotectant/immunomodulator).
 AV-353
 Currently, there are no ongoing clinical trials of Notch 3-specific inhibitors, nor any approved Notch 3-specific inhibitors in oncology. Several agents are currently being explored which target the Notch 3 receptor and may inhibit other Notch receptors, including Notch 1, Notch 2 and Notch 4.
 Strategic Partnerships 
 We have established various strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies for our product candidates and programs in our portfolio. Under each of our strategic partnerships, we are entitled to receive or required to pay upfront, milestone payments and/or royalties. For information on our collaboration agreements focused solely on the clinical development of tivozanib in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, see “— Our Product Candidates — Tivozanib — Clinical Development of Tivozanib in RCC — RCC PD-1 Combination Trial with Opdivo (TiNivo)” and “— Our Product Candidates — Tivozanib — Clinical Development of Tivozanib in HCC — HCC PD-L1 Combination Trial with IMFINZI (DEDUCTIVE).”
Tivozanib 
 Kyowa Kirin Co. (KKC)
 
13

In December 2006, we entered into a license agreement with KKC, or the KKC Agreement, under which we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable license to develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib in all territories in the world except for Asia and the Middle East, where KKC retained the rights to tivozanib. Under the KKC Agreement, we obtained exclusive rights to tivozanib in our territory under certain KKC patents, patent applications and know-how for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of all human diseases and conditions. On August 1, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the KKC Agreement pursuant to which KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights to tivozanib in our territory, excluding the rights we have sublicensed to EUSA under the EUSA Agreement. We have upfront, milestone and royalty payment obligations to KKC under the KKC Agreement, and following the amendment, KKC also has upfront, milestone and royalty payment obligations to us related to non-oncology development by KKC in our territory. Pursuant to the amendment to the KKC Agreement, KKC was required to make a non-refundable upfront payment to us in the amount of $25.0 million that we received in September 2019 and KKC waived a one-time milestone payment of $18.0 million otherwise payable by us upon our obtaining marketing approval for tivozanib in the U.S. 
 If we sublicense any of our rights to tivozanib to a third party, as we have done with EUSA pursuant to the EUSA Agreement, the sublicense defines the payment obligations of the sublicensee, which may vary from the milestone and royalty payment obligations under our KKC Agreement relating to rights we retain. We are required to pay KKC a fixed 30% of amounts we receive from our sublicensees, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, but excluding amounts we receive in respect of research and development reimbursement payments or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. 
 Certain research and development reimbursement payments by EUSA were not subject to sublicense revenue payments to KKC. For example, if EUSA elects to opt-in to the TIVO-3 trial, the additional research and development reimbursement payment from EUSA of 50% of the total trial costs, up to $20.0 million, would also not be subject to a sublicense revenue payment to KKC, subject to certain limitations. We would, however, owe KKC 30% of other, non-research and development payments we may receive from EUSA pursuant to the EUSA Agreement, including reimbursement approvals for RCC in up to five specified EU countries, marketing approvals for RCC in three specified non-EU licensed territories, EU marketing approval filings and corresponding marketing approvals by the EMA for up to three additional indications beyond RCC, and sales-based milestones and royalties. The $2.0 million milestone payments we earned in each of February 2018, November 2018 and February 2019 upon EUSA’s reimbursement approval for FOTIVDA as a first-line treatment for RCC in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain, respectively, were subject to the 30% KKC sublicense fee, or $0.6 million each.
 We are also required to pay tiered royalty payments on net sales we make of tivozanib in our North American territory, which range from the low to mid-teens as a percentage of net sales. The royalty rate escalates within this range based on increasing tivozanib sales. Our royalty payment obligations in a particular country in our territory begin on the date of the first commercial sale of tivozanib in that country, and end on the later of 12 years after the date of first commercial sale of tivozanib in that country or the date of the last to expire of the patents covering tivozanib that have been issued in that country. 
 Pursuant to the amendment to the KKC Agreement, KKC is also required to make milestone payments to us of up to an aggregate of $390.7 million upon the successful achievement of certain development and sales milestones of tivozanib in non-oncology indications. In addition, KKC is required to make tiered royalty payments to us on net sales of tivozanib in non-oncology indications in our territory, which range from high single digit to low double digits as a percentage of net sales. The royalty rate escalates within this range based on increasing tivozanib sales, subject to certain adjustments. KKC’s royalty payment obligations in a particular country in our territory begin on the date of the first commercial sale of tivozanib in that country, and end on the later of the expiration date of the last valid claim of a patent application or patent owned by KKC covering tivozanib or 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of tivozanib in non-oncology indications in that country.
 If KKC sublicenses any of its rights to tivozanib to a third party, KKC is required to pay us a percentage of amounts received from the respective sublicensees related to our territory, including upfront license fees, milestone payments and royalties, but excluding amounts received in respect of research and development reimbursement payments or equity investments, subject to certain limitations. 
 We and KKC each have access to and can benefit from the other party’s clinical data and regulatory filings with respect to tivozanib and biomarkers identified in the conduct of activities under the KKC Agreement, as related to oncology development. Under the KKC Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tivozanib in our territory.
 The KKC Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all of our royalty and sublicense revenue obligations, determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, unless terminated earlier. If we fail to meet our obligations under the KKC Agreement and are unable to cure such failure within specified time periods, KKC can terminate the KKC Agreement, resulting in a loss of our rights to tivozanib and an obligation to assign or license to KKC any intellectual property or other rights we may have in tivozanib, including our regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, patents and trademarks for tivozanib.

EUSA
In December 2015, we entered into a license agreement with EUSA, or the EUSA Agreement, under which we granted to EUSA the exclusive, sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize tivozanib in the territories of Europe (excluding Russia, Ukraine and the Commonwealth of Independent States), Latin America (excluding Mexico), Africa and Australasia for all diseases and conditions in humans, excluding non-oncologic diseases or conditions of the eye. EUSA is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to seek regulatory approval for and commercialize tivozanib throughout its licensed territories for RCC. EUSA has responsibility for all activities and costs associated with the further development, manufacture, regulatory filings and commercialization of tivozanib in its licensed territories. 
 EUSA made research and development reimbursement payments to us of $2.5 million upon the execution of the EUSA Agreement in 2015, and $4.0 million in September 2017 upon its receipt of marketing authorization from the European Commission in August 2017 for tivozanib (FOTIVDA) for the treatment of RCC. In September 2017, EUSA elected to opt-in to co-develop the TiNivo trial. As a result of EUSA’s exercise of its opt-in right, it became an active participant in the ongoing conduct of the TiNivo trial and is able to utilize the resulting data from the TiNivo trial for regulatory and commercial purposes in its territories. EUSA made an additional research and development reimbursement payment to us of $2.0 million upon its exercise of its opt-in right. This payment was received in October 2017, in advance of the completion of the TiNivo trial, and represents EUSA’s approximate 50% share of the total estimated costs of the TiNivo trial. We are also eligible to receive an additional research and development reimbursement payment from EUSA of 50% of our total costs for our TIVO-3 trial, up to $20.0 million, if EUSA elects to opt-in to that study.
 We are entitled to receive milestone payments of $2.0 million per country upon reimbursement approval, if any, for RCC in each of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, which we refer to collectively as the EU5. We are also entitled to receive $2.0 million for the grant of marketing approval for RCC, if any, in three of the licensed countries outside of the EU, as mutually agreed by the parties, the first of which was obtained in New Zealand in July 2019. In February 2018, November 2018 and February 2019, EUSA obtained reimbursement approvals from the NICE in the United Kingdom, the GKV-SV in Germany and the MSCBS in Spain, respectively, for the first-line treatment of RCC. Accordingly, we earned a $2.0 million milestone payment with respect to each reimbursement approval. 
 We are also eligible to receive a payment of $2.0 million per indication in connection with a filing by EUSA with the EMA for marketing approval, if any, for tivozanib for the treatment of each of up to three additional indications and $5.0 million per indication in connection with the EMA’s grant of marketing approval for each of up to three additional indications, as well as up to $335.0 million upon EUSA’s achievement of certain sales thresholds. Upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive tiered double-digit royalties on net sales, if any, of licensed products in its licensed territories ranging from a low double digit up to mid-twenty percent depending on the level of annual net sales. In November 2017, we began earning sales royalties upon EUSA’s commencement of the first commercial launch of tivozanib (FOTIVDA) with the initiation of product sales in Germany. EUSA has received reimbursement approval for and commercially launched FOTIVDA in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Spain as well as in additional non-EU5 countries. EUSA is working to secure reimbursement approval and commercially launch FOTIVDA in some additional European countries. We recognized royalty revenues of approximately $0.9 million, $0.5 million and $19,000 in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 The research and development reimbursement payments under the EUSA Agreement are not subject to the 30% sublicensing payment payable to KKC, subject to certain limitations. We would, however, owe KKC 30% of other, non-research and development payments we may receive from EUSA pursuant to the EUSA Agreement, including any reimbursement approvals for RCC in the EU5, marketing approvals for RCC in three specified non-EU licensed territories, EU marketing approval filings and corresponding marketing approvals by the EMA for up to three additional indications beyond RCC, and sales-based milestones and royalties, as set forth above. The $2.0 million milestone payments we earned in each of February 2018, November 2018 and February 2019 upon EUSA’s reimbursement approval for FOTIVDA in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain, respectively, were subject to the 30% KKC sublicense fee, or $0.6 million, each.
 The term of the EUSA Agreement continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the last to occur of (a) the expiration of the last valid patent claim for such product in such country, (b) the expiration of market or regulatory data exclusivity for such product in such country or (c) the tenth anniversary of the effective date. Either party may terminate the EUSA Agreement in the event of the bankruptcy of the other party or a material breach by the other party that remains uncured, following receipt of written notice of such breach, for a period of (a) thirty (30) days in the case of breach for nonpayment of any amount due under the EUSA Agreement, and (b) ninety (90) days in the case of any other material breach. EUSA may terminate the EUSA Agreement at any time upon one hundred eighty (180) days’ prior written notice. In addition, we may terminate the EUSA Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice if EUSA challenges any of the patent rights licensed under the EUSA Agreement.

Ficlatuzumab
 Biodesix 
 In April 2014, we entered into a worldwide co-development and collaboration agreement with Biodesix, or the Biodesix Agreement, to develop and commercialize ficlatuzumab.  The Biodesix Agreement generally provides for each party to contribute 50% of all clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and other costs to develop ficlatuzumab and to share equally in any future revenue from development or commercialization, subject to opt-out rights and certain other exceptions. We are designated to lead the clinical development of ficlatuzumab following approval of a development plan by a joint steering committee.  
 Under the Biodesix Agreement, we granted Biodesix perpetual, non-exclusive rights to certain intellectual property, including all clinical and biomarker data related to ficlatuzumab, to develop and commercialize VeriStrat®, Biodesix’s proprietary companion diagnostic test. Biodesix granted us perpetual, non-exclusive rights to certain intellectual property, including diagnostic data related to VeriStrat, with respect to the development and commercialization of ficlatuzumab. Each license includes the right to sublicense, subject to certain exceptions. In October 2016, we amended the Biodesix Agreement in connection with the termination of the FOCAL trial, a phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical study of ficlatuzumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in poor prognosis patients in which VeriStrat was used to select clinical trial subjects. We terminated the FOCAL trial after experiencing low rates of positivity for the biomarkers and conducting an interim analysis that confirmed lack of feasibility and commercial opportunity for the targeted patient population.
 Prior to the first commercial sale of ficlatuzumab, each party has the right to elect to discontinue participating in further development or commercialization efforts with respect to ficlatuzumab, which is referred to as an “Opt-Out”. If either we or Biodesix elects to Opt-Out, with such party referred to as the “Opting-Out Party,” then the Opting-Out Party shall not be responsible for any future uncommitted costs associated with developing and commercializing ficlatuzumab other than any ongoing clinical trials. The non-opting out party shall have sole decision-making authority with respect to further development and commercialization of ficlatuzumab. Additionally, the Opting-Out Party shall generally be entitled to receive a royalty equal to 10% of any future net sales of ficlatuzumab throughout the world, and 25% of any future revenue from collaborations. The Biodesix Agreement remains in effect until the expiration of all payment obligations between the parties related to development and commercialization of ficlatuzumab, unless earlier terminated. 
 We and Biodesix are currently funding an investigator-sponsored clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with ERBITUX® (cetuximab) in HNSCC. Recently, an investigator-sponsored trial of ficlatuzumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer was completed and results were presented in January 2020.  Based on the encouraging findings from the CyFi-1 trial, we and Biodesix initiated the CyFi-2 trial. Additional clinical development, beyond what we are currently committed to, will require additional manufacturing efforts and costs. 
 AV-203
 CANbridge
In March 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with CANbridge, or the CANbridge Agreement, under which we granted CANbridge the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize AV-203, our proprietary ErbB3 (HER3) inhibitory antibody, for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease in all countries outside of North America. In addition, CANbridge has a right of first negotiation if we determine to outlicense any North American rights. The parties have both agreed not to develop or commercialize any ErbB3 inhibitory antibody other than AV-203 during the term of the CANbridge Agreement.  CANbridge has responsibility for all activities and costs associated with the development, manufacture and commercialization of AV-203 in its territories. CANbridge is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for AV-203 in each of China, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain and Germany. Under the CANbridge Agreement, CANbridge is required to conduct and fund the clinical development of AV-203 through phase 2 proof-of-concept in ESCC or another agreed upon indication, after which we may elect to contribute to certain worldwide development efforts. 
 In December 2017, CANbridge filed an IND application with the NMPA for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC. CANbridge’s IND application was accepted by the NMPA in August 2018. In March 2020, CANbridge advised us that it is evaluating NRG1 Fusion biomarker directed development plans with the potential to initiate a clinical study in 2021. NRG1 Fusions, which are certain alterations in the NRG1 gene that may cause increased levels of the growth factor NRG1, are a potential biomarker for response to AV-203 in various tumor types.
 
16

Upon entry into the CANbridge Agreement, CANbridge paid us an upfront fee of $1.0 million in April 2016, net of foreign withholding taxes. CANbridge also reimbursed us for $1.0 million in certain AV-203 manufacturing costs that we previously incurred. CANbridge paid this manufacturing reimbursement in two installments of $0.5 million each, one in March 2017 and one in September 2017, net of foreign withholding taxes, following CANbridge’s validation of the manufacturing process for AV-203 drug substance. In August 2018, CANbridge obtained regulatory approval of its IND application from the NMPA for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC and, accordingly, we earned a $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone payment that was received from CANbridge in August 2018.
 Pursuant to the CANbridge Agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $40.0 million in potential additional development and regulatory milestone payments and up to $90.0 million in potential commercial milestone payments based on annual net sales of licensed products. Upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive a tiered royalty, with a percentage range in the low double-digits, on net sales of approved licensed products. CANbridge’s obligation to pay royalties for each licensed product expires on a country-by-country basis on the later of the expiration of patent rights covering such licensed product in such country, the expiration of regulatory data exclusivity in such country or ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. A percentage of any milestone and royalty payments received by us under the CANbridge Agreement, excluding upfront and reimbursement payments, are due to Biogen Idec International GmbH, or Biogen, as a sublicensing fee under our option and license agreement with Biogen dated March 18, 2009, as amended. The $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone we earned in August 2018 for regulatory approval from the NMPA of an IND application for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC was subject to this sublicense fee, or $0.7 million, which was paid to Biogen in October 2018.
 The term of the CANbridge Agreement continues until the last to expire royalty term applicable to licensed products. Either party may terminate the CANbridge Agreement in the event of a material breach of the CANbridge Agreement by the other party that remains uncured for a period of 45 days, in the case of a material breach of a payment obligation, and 90 days in the case of any other material breach. CANbridge may terminate the CANbridge Agreement without cause at any time upon 180 days’ prior written notice to us. We may terminate the CANbridge Agreement upon thirty days’ prior written notice if CANbridge challenges any of the patent rights licensed to CANbridge under the CANbridge Agreement. 
 Biogen Idec International GmbH
 In March 2009, we entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Biogen regarding the development and commercialization of our discovery-stage ErbB3-targeted antibodies for the potential treatment and diagnosis of cancer and other diseases in humans outside of North America. In March 2014, we amended our agreement with Biogen, and regained worldwide rights to AV-203. Pursuant to the amendment, we were obligated to in good faith use reasonable efforts to seek a collaboration partner to fund further development and commercialization of ErbB3-targeted antibodies. We satisfied this obligation in March 2016 upon entering into our CANbridge Agreement. We are obligated to pay Biogen a percentage of milestone payments we receive under the CANbridge Agreement and single-digit royalty payments on net sales related to the sale of AV-203, up to a cumulative maximum amount of $50.0 million. 
 The $2.0 million development and regulatory milestone we earned in August 2018 in connection with CANbridge’s regulatory approval from the NMPA of an IND application for a clinical study of AV-203 in ESCC was subject to this sublicense fee, or $0.7 million, which was paid to Biogen in October 2018.
 AV-380
 St. Vincent’s Hospital 
 In July 2012, we entered into a license agreement with St. Vincent’s, or the St. Vincent’s Agreement, under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide sublicensable right to develop, manufacture and commercialize products for therapeutic applications that benefit from inhibition or decreased expression or activity of MIC-1, which is also known as GDF15. We believe GDF15 is a novel target for cachexia, and we are exploiting this license in our AV-380 program for cachexia. Under the St. Vincent’s Agreement, we have non-exclusive rights to certain related diagnostic products and research tools and also have a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to certain improvements that St. Vincent’s or third parties may make to licensed therapeutic products. We are obligated to use diligent efforts to conduct research and clinical development and commercially launch at least one licensed therapeutic product.

In 2012, we paid St. Vincent’s an upfront license fee of $0.7 million. In August 2015, in connection with the execution of the Novartis Agreement, we amended and restated the St. Vincent’s Agreement and paid St. Vincent’s an additional upfront fee of $1.5 million. As of December 31, 2019, we are required to make future milestone payments, up to an aggregate total of $14.4 million, upon the earlier of achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones or a specified date for the first indication, and upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the second and third indications, for licensed therapeutic products, some of which payments may be increased by a mid to high double-digit percentage rate for milestones payments made after we grant any sublicense, depending on the sublicensed territory. In February 2017, Novartis agreed to pay $1.8 million out of its then future payment obligations to us under the former Novartis Agreement. These funds were used to satisfy a $1.8 million time-based milestone obligation that we owed to St. Vincent’s in March 2017. The $2.3 million payment we received from Novartis in January 2019 pursuant to the AV-380 Transfer Agreement was used to cover a $2.3 million time-based milestone obligation that became due to St. Vincent’s in January 2019. Refer to “ – Our Product Candidates – AV-380” and Note 4, “Collaborations and License Agreements – Out-License Agreements - Novartis”, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding details of the AV-380 Transfer Agreement.
 In addition, we will be required to pay St. Vincent’s tiered royalty payments equal to a low-single-digit percentage of any net sales we or our sublicensees make from licensed therapeutic products. The royalty rate escalates within the low-single-digit range during each calendar year based on increasing licensed therapeutic product sales during such calendar year. Our royalty payment obligations for a licensed therapeutic product in a particular country end on the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of such licensed therapeutic product in such country or expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents covering such licensed therapeutic product in such country and are subject to offsets under certain circumstances. 
 The St. Vincent’s Agreement remains in effect until the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of licensed therapeutic products in the last country in which a commercial sale is made, or expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of the licensed patents, unless we elect, or St. Vincent’s elects, to terminate the St. Vincent’s Agreement earlier. We have the right to terminate the St. Vincent’s Agreement on six months’ notice if we terminate our GDF15 research and development programs as a result of the failure of a licensed therapeutic product in preclinical or clinical development, or if we form the reasonable view that further GDF15 research and development is not commercially viable, and we are not then in breach of any of our obligations under the St. Vincent’s Agreement. 
 Intellectual Property Rights 
 Patent Rights
 We continue to build a strong intellectual property portfolio, and, whenever possible, we seek to have multiple tiers of patent protection for our product candidates.
 Tivozanib
 With respect to tivozanib, we have exclusively licensed from KKC its patents that cover the molecule and its therapeutic use for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of any and all oncologic diseases and conditions in humans and a crystal form of the molecule.  As discussed in “—Strategic Partnerships— Kyowa Kirin Co. (KKC)” above, pursuant to the amendment to the KKC Agreement in August 2019, KKC repurchased the non-oncology rights of tivozanib in our licensed territories, excluding the rights which are currently sublicensed to EUSA Pharma. 
 With respect to tivozanib, we have the following in-licensed patents:
  
• | U.S.: 2 granted patents with expirations ranging from 2022 to 2023
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Europe: 2 granted patents with expirations ranging from 2022 to 2023
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Canada: 1 granted patent expiring in 2022
--+------------------------------------------


• | Australia: 1 granted patent expiring in 2022
--+---------------------------------------------

 The U.S. patent covering the tivozanib molecule and its therapeutic use is expected to expire in 2022.  However, in view of the length of time that tivozanib has been under regulatory review at the FDA, a patent term extension of up to five years may be available under The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, which, if a five-year extension were to be granted, would extend the term of this patent to 2027.  In addition, Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs, have been granted in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, extending the term of the patents in each of these countries up to 2027.  SPC applications are pending in Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Great 
 
18

Britain for the corresponding patents in those countries that cover the tivozanib molecule, which, if granted, could extend the term of the patent in each of those countries up to 2027.
 Additionally, we have filed an international (PCT) patent application directed to our clinical protocol for using tivozanib to treat refractory cancers, particularly, following therapy with checkpoint inhibitors.  If nationalized, we expect that any patent granted on a patent application in this family would expire in 2039. 
 Ficlatuzumab
 With respect to our anti-HGF platform, including ficlatuzumab, we have six U.S. patents covering our anti-HGF antibodies, nucleic acids and expression vectors encoding the antibodies, host cells, methods of making the antibodies, and methods of treatment using the antibodies.  With respect to our anti-HGF platform we have:

• | U.S.: 6 granted patents with expirations ranging from 2027 to 2028
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Europe: 1 granted patent expiring in 2027
--+------------------------------------------


• | Japan: 2 granted patents expiring in 2027
--+------------------------------------------


• | Canada: 1 granted patent expiring in 2027
--+------------------------------------------


• | Australia: 1 granted patent expiring in 2027
--+---------------------------------------------

 AV-203
 With respect to our anti-ErbB3 platform, including AV-203, we have five U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patent applications covering our anti-ErbB3 antibodies, nucleic acids and expression vectors encoding the antibodies, host cells, methods of making the antibodies, and methods of treatment using our anti-ErbB3 antibodies, which are expected to expire from 2031 to 2032.  With respect to our anti-ErbB3 platform we have:
  
• | U.S.: 5 granted patents, and 2 pending patent applications, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2032
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Europe: 1 granted patent, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2032
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Japan: 3 granted patents, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2032
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Canada: 1 granted patent and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2032
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Australia: 2 granted patents and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2031 to 2032
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anti-GDF15 Antibodies
 With respect to our anti-GDF15 platform, we have exclusively licensed certain patent rights from St. Vincent’s, which include a granted U.S. patent directed to a method of increasing appetite and/or body weight upon administering an effective amount of an anti-GDF15 antibody, which is expected to expire in 2029.
 With respect to the licensed patent rights, we have:
  
• | U.S.: 1 granted patent, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2025 to 2029
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Europe: 1 granted patent, and 1 pending patent application, if granted, expiring in 2025
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Japan: 2 granted patents expiring in 2025
--+------------------------------------------


• | Canada: 1 granted patent expiring in 2025
--+------------------------------------------


• | Australia: 1 granted patent expiring in 2025
--+---------------------------------------------

 
19

In addition, we also own two issued U.S. patents and a pending U.S. patent application covering our anti-GDF15 antibodies and methods of treating cachexia and inhibiting loss of muscle mass associated with cachexia using our anti-GDF15 antibodies.  These patents and patent application, if granted, would be expected to expire in 2033.  We also have three pending U.S. patent applications directed to methods of treating or preventing congestive heart failure or chronic kidney disease using an anti-GDF15 antibody, and methods of treating a subject with cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome with an anti-cancer agent and an anti-GDF antibody.  These patent applications, if granted, would be expected to expire in 2035.
 With respect to our GDF15 platform, we have:
  
• | U.S.: 2 granted patents, and 4 pending patent applications, if granted, with expirations ranging from 2033 to 2035
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Europe: 1 granted patent and 4 pending patent applications with expirations, if granted, ranging from 2033 to 2035
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Japan: 4 pending patent applications with expirations, if granted, ranging from 2033 to 2035
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Canada: 2 pending patent applications with expirations, if granted, ranging from 2033 to 2035
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Australia: 1 granted patent expiring in 2033, and 1 pending patent application expiring, if granted, in 2035
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AV-353 Platform
 With respect to our AV-353 platform, we own an issued U.S. patent and two non-provisional U.S. patent applications covering our anti-Notch3 antibodies, nucleic acids and expression vectors encoding the antibodies, host cells, methods of making the antibodies, and methods of treatment using the antibodies.  The issued U.S. patent and the two non-provisional U.S. patent applications, if granted, would be expected to have expirations ranging from 2033 to 2037.  
 With respect to our AV-353 platform, we have:
  
• | U.S.: 1 granted patent expiring in 2033, and 2 pending patent applications expiring, if granted, ranging from 2033 to 2037
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Europe: 1 granted patent expiring in 2033 and 1 pending patent application expiring, if granted, in 2037
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent. A U.S. patent term may be shortened, if a patent is terminally disclaimed by its owner, over another patent.
 The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extensions cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. For example, SPCs have been granted in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden extending the term of the patents in each of these countries up to 2027.  In addition, SPC applications are pending in Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Great Britain, for the corresponding patents in those countries that cover the tivozanib molecule, which, if granted, could extend the term of the patent in each of those countries up to 2027.
 Many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and academic institutions are competing with us in the field of oncology and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. With regard to ficlatuzumab, we are aware of two separate families of United States patents and foreign counterparts, with each of the two families being owned by a different third party, that contain broad claims related to anti-HGF antibodies having certain binding properties and their use. In the event that an owner of one or more of these patents were to bring an infringement action against us, we may have to argue that our product, its manufacture or use does not infringe a valid claim of the patent in question. Furthermore, if we were to challenge the validity of any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every United States patent. This means that in order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent’s claims. There is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement or validity.
 Over the years, we have found it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from third-party intellectual property holders. Where licenses are readily available at reasonable cost, such licenses are considered a normal cost of doing business. In other instances, 
 
20

however, we may have used the results of freedom-to-operate studies to guide our research away from areas where we believed we were likely to encounter obstacles in the form of third-party intellectual property. For example, where a third party holds relevant intellectual property and is a direct competitor, a license might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or available at all.
 In spite of our efforts to avoid obstacles and disruptions arising from third-party intellectual property, it is impossible to establish with certainty that our technology platform or our product programs will be free of claims by third-party intellectual property holders. Even with modern databases and on-line search engines, literature searches are imperfect and may fail to identify relevant patents and published applications. Even when a third-party patent is identified, we may conclude upon a thorough analysis, that we do not infringe the patent or that the patent is invalid. If the third-party patent owner disagrees with our conclusion and we continue with the business activity in question, patent litigation may be initiated against us. Alternatively, we might decide to initiate litigation in an attempt to have a court declare the third-party patent invalid or non-infringed by our activity. In either scenario, patent litigation typically is costly and time-consuming, and the outcome is uncertain. The outcome of patent litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be quantified in advance, for example, the credibility of expert witnesses who may disagree on technical interpretation of scientific data. Ultimately, in the case of an adverse outcome in litigation, we could be prevented from commercializing a product or using certain aspects of our technology platform as a result of patent infringement claims asserted against us. This could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 To protect our competitive position, it may be necessary to enforce our patent rights through litigation against infringing third parties. Litigation to enforce our own patent rights is subject to the same uncertainties discussed above. In addition, however, litigation involving our patents carries the risk that one or more of our patents will be held invalid (in whole or in part, on a claim-by-claim basis) or held unenforceable. Such an adverse court ruling could allow third parties to commercialize our products or our platform technology, and then compete directly with us, without making any payments to us.
 Trademarks
 We seek trademark protection in the United States and other jurisdictions where available and when appropriate. We have filed applications and obtained registrations for several trademarks intended for potential use in the marketing of tivozanib, including the trademark FOTIVDA, which we have registered in the United States and over 20 other jurisdictions, and for which we have filed applications in additional countries. We own U.S. and EU registrations for a logo containing FOTIVDA in combination with a flame design. We own U.S. registrations for AVEO and AVEO (in stylized letters), trademarks that we use in connection with our business in general.  We have also registered AVEO as a trademark in over 20 other jurisdictions.
Manufacturing 
 We or our partners currently contract with third parties, to the extent we require, for the manufacture of our product candidates and intend to do so in the future for both clinical and potential commercial needs. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers, or CMOs.
 One of our CMOs has manufactured what we believe to be sufficient quantities of tivozanib drug product (capsules) to support our ongoing and planned clinical trials and potential initial commercial launch. We currently engage the same CMO to package, label and distribute clinical supplies of tivozanib on an as–needed basis. We also engaged another CMO to bottle, label and serialize potential commercial launch supply. 
 To date, third-party manufacturers have met the needs for manufacturing clinical trial supplies for all our pipeline products. There are alternate manufacturers with capability to supply for current clinical or potential future commercial needs. Contracting with additional CMOs may require significant lead-times and result in additional costs. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, sales, pricing, reimbursement, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

Review and Approval of Drugs and Biologics in the United States
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and related regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Biological products are subject to regulation by the FDA under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, FDCA and related regulations, and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. 
The failure of an applicant to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, including non-clinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process or post-approval process, may result in delays to the conduct of a study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, the FDA’s refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines and civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA or Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other government entities, including state agencies.  
 An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug or biological product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA, for a drug candidate product and a biological licensing application, or BLA, for a biological product requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or similar foreign standards, which we refer to as cGMPs, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA or BLA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage.  Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the product candidate for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long-term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 The IND and IRB Processes
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans.  Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug or biologic that is not the subject of an approved NDA or BLA.  In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.  In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among 
 
22

other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.  The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin.  This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks.  At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.
 Following 
commencement of a 
clinical trial 
under an IND, 
the FDA 
may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. Clinical holds are imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, nonclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC). A clinical hold is an order issued 
by the FDA 
to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
 A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies.
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 The FDA’s primary objectives in reviewing an IND are to assure the safety and rights of patients and to help assure that the quality of the investigation will be adequate to permit an evaluation of the drug’s effectiveness and safety and of the biological product’s safety, purity and potency. The decision to terminate development of an investigational drug or biological product may be made by either a health authority body such as the FDA, an IRB or ethics committee, or by us for various reasons. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the trial. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
 Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use
 Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or Treatment IND Application. 
 
23

When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product.
 On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act later amended) a requirement that sponsors of one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect.  This provision requires drug and biologic companies to make publicly available their policies for expanded access for individual patient access to products intended for serious diseases. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of initiation of a phase 2 or phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
 In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
 Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA or BLA
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial.  Clinical trials are conducted under written trial protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
 The clinical investigation of an investigational drug or biological product is generally divided into four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The four phases of an investigation are as follows:
  
• | Phase 1. Phase 1 studies include the initial introduction of an investigational new drug or biological product into humans. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug or biological product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s or biological product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid phase 2 clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug or biological product for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under trial, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug or biological product. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug or biological product has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug or biological product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.

• | Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur.  In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in 
 
24

the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor or the data monitoring committee may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.  The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Finally, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an application or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 For drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety days after FDA’s receipt of the study plan.  The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
 The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits an NDA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the NDA if the drug is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.  The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary efficacy to inform pediatric labeling for the product.
 Submission and Review of an NDA or BLA by the FDA
 In order to obtain approval to market a drug or biological product in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the proposed drug product for the proposed indication, and the safety, purity and potency of the biological product for its intended indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product and the safety, purity and potency of the biological product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 The NDA is a vehicle through which applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new product for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications.  Every new drug product candidate must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States.  Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2020 is $2,942,965 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2020 is $325,424.  Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. If an application is withdrawn prior to the FDA acceptance for filing, 75% of these fees may be refunded to the sponsor. If an application is withdrawn after filing, a lower portion of these fees may be refunded in certain circumstances.
 Following submission of an NDA or BLA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of the application generally within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine 
 
25

whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review.  The FDA may request additional information rather than accept the application for filing.  In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information.  The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.  Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.  The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs and BLAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for “priority review” are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of products that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 Before approving an application, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured.  These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA or BLA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories.  The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.  Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.  In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS.  REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks.  To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. Under the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel product to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made.  Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.  The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA or BLA
 On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation.
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to 
 
26

address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross‑disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case‑by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment‑limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
 Finally, with passage of the Cures Act in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies.  A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition.  The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
 Accelerated Approval Pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect 
on the 
surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively 
in the 
development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. Thus, the benefit of accelerated approval derives from the potential to receive approval based on surrogate endpoints sooner than possible for trials with clinical or survival endpoints, rather than deriving from any explicit shortening of the FDA approval timeline, as is the case with priority review.
 
27

The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post‑approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of phase 4 or post‑approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, would allow the FDA to initiate expedited proceedings to withdraw approval of the product. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Post-Approval Regulation
 Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product.  After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 In addition, manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market.   Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to 
a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states.  The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.

Generic Drugs
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs.  To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency.  An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD.
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug.  At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug.  Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if “the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.”  Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the RLD in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD.  In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired.  The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity.  For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA.  An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance.  In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.  The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application.
 The FDCA also provides for 
a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved.
 The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight (8) months for a drug that has three (3) or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA’s drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of ‘‘competitor generic therapies’’ or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application.
 Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay
 Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed 
for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would.
 
29

Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
  
• | the required patent information has not been filed;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent has expired;
--+-------------------------------


• | the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the applicant is not seeking approval).
 If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
 To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, 
listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 Patent Term Restoration and Extension
 A patent claiming a new drug product 
may be 
eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used 
to extend the 
remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
 Biosimilars
 The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 or BPCIA. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. As of January 1, 2020, the FDA has approved 26 biosimilar products for use in the United States.  No interchangeable biosimilars, however, have been approved.  The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.  Additional guidance is expected to be finalized by FDA in the near term.
 Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 
30

Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.  A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA or BLA for the candidate product.  If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use.  Orphan drug designation does not shorten the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee.
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity.  Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances.  Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different indications.  If a drug or biologic designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug or biologic for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.
 Pediatric Exclusivity
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity.  This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA or BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data.  The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted.  If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months.  This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.  With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which a generic (ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent is valid and infringed by a proposed generic product.
 FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product.  In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication.  Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics Device Evaluation and Safety.
 Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical

device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post‑market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. 
 
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market 
approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate.  The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling.  PMA applications are subject to an application fee.  For federal fiscal year 2020, the standard fee is $340,995 and the small business fee is $85,249.
 A clinical trial is typically required for a PMA application and, in a small percentage of cases, the FDA may require a clinical study in support of a 510(k) submission. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the FDA’s IDE regulation. The IDE regulation distinguishes between significant and non-significant risk device studies and the procedures for obtaining approval to begin the study differ accordingly. Also, some types of studies are exempt from the IDE regulations. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA and an IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. Non-significant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A non-significant risk device study requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study.
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States
 Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 Clinical Trial Approval in the EU
 Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, 
an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state 
in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if 
the clinical trial is to be 
conducted in 
a number of member states
. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study 
site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application, or CTA, must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
 
32

In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will become directly applicable to and binding in all 28 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State.  
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU Portal and Database”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the appointed reporting Member State, whose assessment report is submitted for review by the sponsor and all other competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States). Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the Concerned Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 The new Clinical Trials Regulation has not yet become effective.  As of January 1, 2020, the website of the European Commission reported that the implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation was dependent on the development of a fully functional clinical trials portal and database, which would be confirmed by an independent audit, and that the new legislation would come into effect six months after the European Commission publishes a notice of this confirmation. The website indicated that the audit was expected to commence in December 2020.
 As in the United States, similar requirements for posting clinical trial information are present in other countries; for the members of the EU, the website EudraCT can be found at: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/.
 PRIME Designation in 
the EU
 In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist.  The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure.  Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies.  Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted.  Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level.  A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
 Marketing Authorization
 In the EU, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through several different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process.
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. It is optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases. These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a “major public health interest.” Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease, such as severely disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In these circumstances, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.
 
33

The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State.  In accordance with this procedure, an applicant submits an application for marketing authorization to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States.  This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure.  The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.  The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States which, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.  If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.  In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State.  Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU Member States.  Authorization in accordance with either of these procedures will result in authorization of the medicinal product only in the reference EU Member State and in the other concerned EU Member States.
 A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU.  Regulation No. 1901/2006 provides that, prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP.
 Regulatory Data Protection in the European Union
 In the EU, new chemical entities approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004
, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for a period of eight years. During the additional two‑year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten‑year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the EU
 Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of: (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed.  For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
 Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and, in addition, a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process, including scientific assistance for trial protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees.  However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product.  The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Orphan drug 
exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug or biologic for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand.  This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority.
 
34

Regulatory Requirements After Marketing Authorization
 Following marketing authorization of a medicinal product in the EU, the holder of the authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting, as well as rules potentially requiring post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.  In addition, the manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU. Finally, the marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of drugs and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU notably under Directive 2001/83EC, as amended, and EU Member State laws.  Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU
, commonly referred to as Brexit. 
 Following protracted negotiations, the United 
Kingdom left the EU

on January 31, 2020. 
 Under the withdrawal agreement, there is a transitional period until December 31, 2020 (extendable up to two years). Discussions between the United Kingdom and the EU
 have so far mainly 
focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements 
but have been extremely difficult to date. To date, only an outline of a trade agreement has been reached.  Much remains open but the Prime Minister has indicated that the United Kingdom will not seek to extend the transitional period beyond the end of 2020.  If no trade agreement has been reached before the end of the transitional period, there may be significant market and economic disruption.  The Prime Minister has also indicated that the United Kingdom will not accept high regulatory alignment with the EU. 
 Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products 
in the United Kingdom 
covering quality, 
safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU
 directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future 
regulatory regime that applies to products and 
the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, may force us to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and/or the EU for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.
 General Data Protection Regulation
 The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater.  The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR.  Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs.  Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product.  The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs.  Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication.
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product candidate could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.  Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization.
 In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval.  For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use.  EU member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market.  Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions.  Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU.  The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained.  Reference pricing used by various EU member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices.  There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.
 
36

Healthcare Law and Regulation
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval.  Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians and patient privacy laws and regulations and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements.  Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing •or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the ACA, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and transfers of value to other health care providers and health care entities, or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States.
 
37

By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are:
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee would not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price”, or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point‑of‑sale‑discount off the negotiated price of applicable products to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient products to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program that could result in reduced payments for prescription products. However, the IPAB implementation has been not been clearly defined. The ACA provided that under certain circumstances, IPAB recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation that will achieve the same or greater Medicare cost savings; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription product spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed state and federal legislation 
designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
 
38

Since enactment of the ACA, there have been, and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the “individual mandate.” The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019.  Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax.  Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” The Congress may consider other legislation to replace elements of the ACA during the next Congressional session.
 In addition, 
on December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The Trump administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the same judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal. The Trump Administration recently represented to the Court of Appeals considering this judgment that it does not oppose the lower court’s ruling.  On July 10, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard oral argument in this case.  On December 18, 2019, that court affirmed the lower court’s ruling that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is unconstitutional and it remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration of the severability question and additional analysis of the provisions of the ACA. On January 21, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review this decision on an expedited basis.  Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, if impaneled, would have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and established the a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
 Since its enactment, some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial, Congressional, and Executive challenges. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld certain key aspects of the legislation, including a tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly the requirement that all individuals maintain health insurance coverage or pay a penalty, referred to as the “individual mandate". However, the current presidential administration has indicated that enacting changes to the ACA is a legislative priority and has discussed repealing and replacing or amending the ACA. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation to date, the 2017 Tax Reform Act includes a provision repealing the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year through 2027. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years, including Since 2016, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing or delaying penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees.
 The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA.  Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that 
 
39

reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state attorneys general filed suit to stop the Trump Administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, CMS has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. This decision is under review by the U.S. Supreme Court during its current term. The full effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known.
 Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2020 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the budget period or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, on December 23, 2019, the Trump Administration published a proposed rulemaking that, if finalized, would allow states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to FDA for review and approval. Applicants would be required to demonstrate their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost savings for consumers.  At the same time, FDA issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products).
 For example, on May 11, 2018, the Trump Administration issued a plan to lower drug prices.  Under this blueprint for action, the Trump Administration indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, will: take steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies; advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition; evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers’ ads to enhance price competition; speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers; avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid; work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers; examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program; update Medicare’s drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency; prohibit Part D contracts that include “gag rules” that prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance; and require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases.  In addition, on December 23, 2019, the Trump Administration published a proposed rulemaking that, if finalized, would allow states or certain other non-federal government entities to submit importation program proposals to FDA for review and approval. Applicants would be required to demonstrate their importation plans pose no additional risk to public health and safety and will result in significant cost savings for consumers.  At the same time, FDA issued draft guidance that would allow manufacturers to import their own FDA-approved drugs that are authorized for sale in other countries (multi-market approved products).
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 There have been, and likely will continue to be, 
additional legislative 
and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal, and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
