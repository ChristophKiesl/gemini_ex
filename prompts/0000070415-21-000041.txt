Company Overview

References in this report to “GP Strategies,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” are to GP Strategies Corporation and its subsidiaries, collectively.
GP Strategies is a leading workforce transformation partner. The company provides custom workforce performance solutions for all levels of an organization. We believe our transformation focus, combined with a customer-centric approach, industry innovation and workforce expertise help clients achieve superior business and operational results by enabling higher levels of workforce effectiveness. For over 50 years, we have been providing solutions to optimize workforce performance. Our solutions include business consulting, leadership development, learning strategies & solutions, managed learning services, sales solutions, technology implementation & adoption solutions, and technical services.
We believe we are at our best when driving innovation—integrating leading technologies, developing new learning paradigms, and instituting fresh business processes and measurement approaches.
We work with clients primarily in the Automotive, Financial Services, Defense and Aerospace, and Technology industries including Global Fortune 500 and other commercial customers across other major industries. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided services to 125 customers in the Fortune 500 and 121 customers in the Global Fortune 500. 
We built our workforce transformation business through internal growth and the acquisition of complementary businesses. Since 2006, we have completed over 30 acquisitions to strengthen our capabilities in specific service areas, expanded our global 
presence, and increased our customer base and market sector reach.  As a result, we have added product sales training and leadership training, and strengthened our digital learning and content development expertise, while also expanding further internationally. Our acquisitions have expanded our market sector reach, added new customers and enhanced our service offerings through the addition of new complementary services. We also invested in global expansion through the establishment of over twenty new subsidiaries in select countries since 2013 to support new global outsourcing contracts. We believe our expanded infrastructure and the ability to deliver globally will allow us to better support our existing client base as well as win new business for our comprehensive service offerings. 
In 2020 and 2019, we divested certain non-core assets. Specifically, we sold our IC Axon Division on October 1, 2020 and Alternative Fuels Division on January 1, 2020. We sold our Tuition Program Management Business on October 1, 2019. See Note 4 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding divested businesses.
Operating Segments

Effective July 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new organizational structure on a regional basis through our three geographic markets, North America, Europe Middle East Africa (EMEA) and Emerging Markets (Latin America and Asia Pacific countries). These became our reportable segments in the third quarter of 2020. 
The reorganization was done to achieve the following:
•Simplify the matrix and empower rapid local decision making in service of our clients.
•Unlock the potential of organic growth to achieve better business results for our clients and the Company.
•Leverage global practice systems, processes, and intellectual property while enabling regional authority to better align and deliver to local client needs.
•Enable efficient use of our corporate infrastructure with regional resources.
Across our regional operating structure, the Company provides Workforce Transformation Services categorized into three primary solution sets:
•Organizational Performance Solutions (OPS) - solutions include managed learning services, digital learning strategies and content development, business consulting, and leadership development solutions
•Technical Performance Solutions (TPS) - solutions include technical training and consulting services, enterprise technology adoption and Human Capital Management (HCM) implementation services. 
•Automotive Performance Solutions (APS) - provides workforce development services, sales enablement solutions, including custom product sales training and other customer loyalty and marketing related services. 
We have also identified four focus industries to deliver these services which include Automotive, Financial Services, Defense and Aerospace and Technology. Each of our three reportable segments represent an operating segment under ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting.

Competitive Strengths

We believe our key competitive strengths include:

Global Delivery and Single-Source Custom Workforce Transformation Solutions Provider. We believe we are one of the largest independent single-source workforce transformation solutions provider with the capability of delivering globally in the markets in which we compete. We provide managed learning services solutions spanning the full life-cycle of the training process, including the management of training departments and administrative processes for our customers. We believe that the breadth of our service and product offerings, which encompass fully integrated managed learning services solutions as well as discrete services, allows us to better serve the needs of our clients by providing them with a single-source solution for custom training, consulting and technical services. The integration of our services into a single platform, together with our global presence and delivery capabilities, allows our customers to leverage an enterprise-wide solution to address their performance improvement needs in a way that streamlines their internal operations, improves the speed and efficiency at which critical know-how is disseminated on a firm-wide basis, and enables them to achieve their desired performance improvement goals.

Outstanding Reputation in the Industry. We have continued to build an outstanding reputation in the learning and training industry through the delivery of our solutions and have received numerous awards. 2020 highlights include: 
Industry Awards
•Training Industry, Inc., The Top Training Companies™ lists are developed based on extensive, proprietary research and analysis of companies around the world. They examine the capabilities, experience, and expertise of hundreds of learning organizations. In 2020, we appeared on the Top 20 lists in the following categories: Assessment & Evaluation, Custom Content Development, Experiential Learning Technologies, Health & Safety Compliance Training, Leadership Training, Sales Training, and Training Outsourcing.
•Brandon Hall HCM Excellence recognizes the best organizations that have successfully deployed programs and strategies that have achieved measurable results. We received twelve Brandon Hall Excellence awards.

•General Motors - Recognizes GM’s best suppliers that have consistently exceeded GM’s expectation, creating outstanding value, or introducing innovations to the company. This is the fourth consecutive year GP Strategies has been recognized.
Integration with Technology Platforms. Our high impact, scalable custom and packaged programs are delivered across a range of digital formats including, but not limited to: virtual classroom, learning experience platforms, chatbots, adaptive learning platforms and gamification platforms. In addition to our internal toolset, we have a robust technology partner ecosystem that covers 36 categories and more than 150 platforms. By combining our expertise in consulting, design, delivery, evaluation and administration with best of breed tools, GP Strategies brings scalable, high-impact solutions that deliver value to our clients at scale. 

Deep Technical Expertise. In the 1960’s, we began providing technical services to the U.S. Navy nuclear submarine program and the nuclear electric-power generation industry, and have since maintained and expanded our reputation for providing technically complex consulting, engineering, and training services. Many of our employees have engineering degrees, technical training or years of relevant technical industry experience. Through repeat projects with industry leaders we have acquired significant industry experience in providing highly technical consulting services. We believe that our technical expertise allows us to address market opportunities for complex business challenges that require in-depth expertise and certifications typically acquired over several years of specialized training and many years of experience. We also believe that our ability to provide both training-related and business consulting services allows us to gain insight into operations of our customers, understand the challenges they face and develop optimal solutions to meet these challenges. In addition, we believe that the knowledge that we develop while working with our clients provides us with a significant competitive advantage as those clients look to expand the scope of services outsourced to third party service providers.
Well Positioned to Capitalize on the Large Product Sales Training Market. We believe that the introduction of new products with advanced features, combined with the growing amount and accessibility of information available to consumers, requires companies to maintain a highly skilled and technologically current sales force to effectively capture customer interest and confidence. In-house implementation of product sales training programs can be expensive and time-consuming as these programs typically involve significant levels of face-to-face training, in some cases across a large global sales force. In addition, product sales training tends to be a continuous process, as the pace of new products and features in many cases requires year-round updating of the sales force. We believe we have one of the industry’s leading product sales training platforms, and are well positioned to benefit from increased training outsourcing as companies look for ways to reduce costs.
Focus on Innovation. We believe we have a proven track record of bringing innovations to our customers and are committed to identifying, incubating, launching, and promoting solutions, products, and services for our clients. We achieve this by leveraging both our deep network of content and technology partners and our internal intellectual property, processes and technology. As we launch new products and services, we support our employees through our own modern academies, offering training and micro credentials using advanced tools and technologies. GP Strategies’ Executive Innovation Council, provides critical governance regarding innovation, including direction, strategy refinement, and enterprise-wide alignment. This team of practitioners from across the organization provides insight into innovation across the organization, helps identify trends and emerging needs from the industry and provide recommendations for innovation activities. 
Highly Qualified and Dedicated Employees and Tenured Management Team. Our most important asset is our people, as their wide-ranging skill sets enable us to serve our diverse and expanding global client base. As a result, we are committed to the continued development of our employees. We offer our employees technical, functional, industry, managerial and leadership skill development and training throughout their careers with us. We seek to reinforce our employees’ commitment to our clients, culture and values through a comprehensive performance management system and a career philosophy that rewards both individual performance and teamwork. We also benefit from the skill and experience of our executive management team, who together have in excess of 100 years of experience in the training industry and have an average tenure with our company of over 15 years.

Contracts

We currently perform under fixed price (including fixed-fee per transaction), time-and-materials and cost-reimbursable contracts. The following table illustrates the percentage of our total revenue attributable to each type of contract for the year ended December 31, 2020:

Fixed fee per transaction | 58 | %
Fixed price | 17 | 
Time-and-materials, including fixed rate | 20 | 
Cost-reimbursable | 5 | 
Total revenue | 100 | %


Fixed price contracts (including fixed-fee per transaction) provide for payment to us of pre-determined amounts as compensation for the delivery of specific products or services, without regard to the actual costs incurred. We bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs required to perform the specified services may reduce our profit or cause us to sustain a loss, but we have the opportunity to derive increased profit if the costs required to perform the specified services are less than expected. 
Fixed price contracts generally permit the client to terminate the contract on written notice; in the event of such termination we would typically be paid a proportionate amount of the fixed price.

Time-and-materials contracts generally provide for billing of services based upon the hourly billing rates of the employees performing the services and the actual expenses incurred multiplied by a specified mark-up factor up to a certain aggregate dollar amount. Our time-and-materials contracts include certain contracts under which we have agreed to provide training, engineering and technical services at fixed hourly rates. Time-and-materials contracts generally permit the client to control the amount, type and timing of the services to be performed by us and to terminate the contract on written notice. If a contract is terminated, we are typically paid for the services we have provided through the date of termination.
Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for us to be reimbursed for our actual direct and indirect costs plus a fee. These contracts also are generally subject to termination at the convenience of the client. If a contract is terminated, we are typically reimbursed for our costs through the date of termination, plus the cost of an orderly termination, and paid a proportionate amount of the fee.

International

We conduct our business outside the U.S. primarily through our wholly owned subsidiaries. We may continue to create new subsidiaries as our business expands. Through these subsidiaries, we are capable of providing substantially the same services and products as are available to clients in the U.S., although modified as appropriate to address the language, business practices and cultural factors unique to each client and country. In combination with our subsidiaries, we are able to coordinate the delivery to multi-national clients of services and products that achieve consistency on a global, enterprise-wide basis.  Revenue from operations outside the U.S. represented approximately 36%, 36% and 33% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively (see Note 15 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements).
Customers

During 2020, we provided services to over 750 customers worldwide. Significant customers include multinational automotive manufacturers, such as General Motors Company, Ford Motor Company, BMW, Daimler, Volkswagen and Nissan; financial services companies such as HSBC, Bank of America, CIGNA, Anthem, United Overseas Bank, Truist and PNC Bank; technology services companies such as Microsoft, Cisco, Facebook and Siemens; Aerospace services companies such as Lockheed Martin, US Army, General Dynamics, Boeing, Bechtel National, Inc. and Amentum: governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Skills Funding Agency in the United Kingdom. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided services to 125 customers in the Fortune 500 and 121 customers in the Global Fortune 500.
We have a market concentration of revenue in both the automotive sector and financial services sector. Revenue from the automotive industry accounted for approximately 25%, 28% and 23% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  In addition, we have a concentration of revenue from a single automotive customer, which accounted for approximately 14%, 13% and 14% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 accounts receivable from a single automotive customer totaled $16.7 million, or 15%, and $17.2 million, or 13%, respectively, of our consolidated accounts receivable balance.

Revenue from the financial services industry accounted for approximately 17%, 16% and 19% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, we have a concentration of revenue from a single financial services customer, which accounted for approximately 9%, 10% and 13% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, billed and unbilled accounts receivable from a single financial services customer totaled $7.2 million, or 5%, and $15.4 million, or 8%, respectively, of our consolidated accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances. 
No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2020 or consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2020.
We believe the nature of our business, which includes established relationships with our clients, provides us with a platform from which to drive revenues and gives us visibility into our future performance. We have long-standing relationships with many of our clients, with 88% of our top 25 clients having used our services for five or more years. Additionally, over 95% of 
our annual revenue is generated from client relationships that existed in the prior year. We also had a backlog for services under executed contracts of $316.1 million as of December 31, 2020. 
Human Capital
GP Strategies is a professional services organization primarily focused on providing process improvement and learning and development solutions to hundreds of clients across more than 30 countries. As such, our human capital is material to our operations and core to the long-term success of the company.
Our People. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of approximately 4,343 employees, down from an aggregate of approximately 4,856 employees as of the end of fiscal 2019. The reduction in total employees largely represent the contraction required due to the impact of COVID-19. We also utilize additional adjunct instructors and consultants as needed. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Diversity and Inclusion. Diversity and Inclusion are core to our culture, and we believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success. GP Strategies strives to create an environment that welcomes, and values inclusion and diversity based on age, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, personality type, and thinking style. To foster our goals surrounding diversity and inclusion, we have created several Employee Resource Groups based on employee feedback, including those supporting Women, Black, and the LGBTQ+ communities. The Company has a dedicated Vice President of Diversity & Engagement, and a Diversity Council made up of employees, that provides regular updates to senior management. 
Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention. Hiring, developing and retaining employees is critically important to our operations and we are focused on creating experiences and programs that foster growth, performance and retention. Acquiring the right talent at speed and scale is a core capability that we regularly monitor and manage, given the need to rapidly staff our frontline operations. We periodically measure our Time to Offer performance against regional benchmarks to confirm our performance meets or exceeds benchmarks. We sponsor numerous training, education and leadership development programs for all level of employees, designed to enhance leadership and managerial capability, ensure quality execution of our programs, drive client satisfaction and increase return on investment. Our Education Program provides eligible employees with cost reimbursement related to the pursuit of an advance education. The Company regularly conducts Employee surveys to assess engagement of its Employees, and uses information from the surveys to improve the Company’s ability to develop and retain talented Employees who will help advance the Company.
Compensation, Benefits, Safety and Wellness. In addition to offering market competitive salaries and wages, we offer comprehensive health and retirement benefits to eligible employees. Our core health and welfare benefits are supplemented with specific programs to manage or improve common health conditions, a variety of voluntary benefits and paid time away from work programs. We also provide innovative programs designed to promote physical, emotional and financial well-being. Our health and safety program monitors and ensures the well-being of our employees.
Competition

We face a highly competitive environment. The principal competitive factors are the experience and capability of service personnel, performance, quality and functionality of products, reputation and price. The training industry is large, highly fragmented and competitive, with low barriers to entry and no single competitor accounting for a significant market share. According to Training Industry, Inc., global external training expenditures totaled approximately $92.8 billion in 2020. Our competitors include several large publicly traded and privately held companies, vocational and technical training schools, degree-granting colleges and universities, continuing education programs and thousands of small privately held training providers and individuals. In addition, many of our clients maintain internal training departments, which have the resources and ability to provide the same or similar services in-house. Some of our competitors offer services and products at lower prices, and some competitors have significantly greater financial, managerial, technical, marketing and other resources. Moreover, we expect to face additional competition from new entrants into the training and performance improvement market due, in part, to the evolving nature of the market and the relatively low barriers to entry. There can be no assurance that we will be successful against such competition.

Technical and consulting services such as those that we provide are performed by many of the customers themselves, large architectural and engineering firms that have expanded their range of services beyond design and construction activities, large consulting firms, information technology companies, major suppliers of equipment and individuals and independent service companies similar to us. The technical services market is highly competitive and require substantial resources and capital investment in equipment, technology and skilled personnel.  Many of our competitors for our technical consulting services have 
greater financial resources than we do.  Competition also places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to compete successfully, and the failure to do so could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

Sales & Marketing

Sales, marketing and proposal resources are centralized to better position ourselves to achieve the growth goals of the organization. We operate as an integrated, customer-centric team to ensure our go-to-customer strategy directly supports the business strategy.  We use our online digital presence, attendance at trade shows, presentations at industry and trade association conferences, press releases, industry award submissions, webinars and workshops given by our personnel to serve important marketing functions. We also carry out selective print and digital advertising and conduct targeted marketing campaigns to current and prospective clients. In addition, we use our social media channels, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, SlideShare and a Company blog on our website, as a means of sharing thought leadership content, disclosing information about the Company, our services and other topics important to our clients.  By staying ahead of the market trends and engaging with clients, we are able to identify possible opportunities to expand the services we are providing them as well as extend the current services we are providing. In other cases, clients ask us to bid competitively. In both cases, we submit proposals to the client for evaluation. The period between submission of a proposal to final award can range from 30 days or less (generally for noncompetitive, short-term contracts), to a year or more (generally for large, competitive multi-year contracts).
Backlog

Our backlog for services under executed contracts and subcontracts was approximately $316.1 million and $349.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We anticipate that approximately 85 percent of our backlog as of December 31, 2020 will be recognized as revenue during 2021. However, the rate at which services are performed under certain contracts, and thus the rate at which backlog will be recognized, may be at the discretion of the client and most contracts are, as mentioned above, subject to termination by the client upon written notice.
