ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction

We design, develop, manufacture and market organic light emitting diode, or OLED miniature displays, which we refer to as OLED-on-silicon microdisplays, virtual imaging products that utilize OLED microdisplays, and related products. We also perform research in the OLED field. We are one of the leading U.S. producers of OLED microdisplays and manufacture our products at our facility located in the Hudson Valley of New York State. Our virtual imaging products integrate OLED technology with silicon chips to produce high-resolution microdisplays which, when viewed through a magnifying headset, create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large-screen television. Our products enable our original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers in the military, consumer and commercial markets to develop and market improved or new electronic products. We believe our Direct Patterning Technology, or dPd™, could significantly transform the way the world consumes information. Since 2001, our microdisplays have been used in AR/VR, aircraft helmets, heads-up display systems, thermal scopes, night vision goggles, weapon systems and a variety of other applications.

We believe that our OLED microdisplays offer a number of significant advantages over comparable liquid crystal microdisplays, including higher contrast, greater power efficiency, less weight, more compact size, and negligible image smearing. Using our active matrix OLED technology, many computer and electronic system functions can be built directly into the OLED microdisplay silicon backplane, resulting in compact, high resolution and power efficient systems. Already proven in military and commercial systems, our product portfolio of OLED microdisplays deliver high-resolution, virtual images that perform effectively even in extreme temperatures and high-vibration conditions.

Our OEM customers incorporate our OLED displays in a variety of products including, military aviation helmets, military weapons sights and targeting systems, night vision and thermal imaging devices, training and simulation, visualization for ocular surgery, mobile ultrasound, and augmented reality applications.

We believe our technology, intellectual property portfolio and position in the marketplace give us a leadership position in OLED and OLED-on-silicon microdisplay technology. We have an intellectual property portfolio that includes 50 issued U.S. patents and 14 pending U.S. patent applications, and have over 20 years of manufacturing know-how and other proprietary technologies to create our high-performance OLED microdisplays. We also have 22 issued foreign patents and 12 pending foreign patent applications. We believe that we are one of only a few companies to market and produce significant quantities of high resolution, small molecule OLED-on-silicon microdisplays. 

Consumer, commercial (in which we include the medical and industrial sectors), and military customers are increasingly turning to us because of our technological leadership in display brightness and resolution. This leadership in brightness is further demonstrated by our proprietary dPd capability. Unlike traditional OLED microdisplays that produce colors by using a white source with filters that eliminate about 80% of the emitted light, with dPd we make full color displays by directly depositing each of the primary color materials on respective sub-pixels, without the use of filters. We have fabricated full color displays, including our 4kX4k and WUXGA displays using our dPd tool, which was newly upgraded and installed during 2021. In July 2021, using our dPd technology we created full color WUXGA displays with a brightness of over 10,000 cd/m2, which we demonstrated to industry analysts in October 2021. We expect to achieve a brightness level of over 22,000 cd/m2 ready for mass production of full color displays by 2024. We achieved the highest monochrome brightness levels in the market years ago and are continuing our leadership with color displays. Display brightness is critical for AR/VR devices because of optics inefficiency and the need to eliminate motion artifacts. This is especially important for heads up displays used in bright, daylight environments. Our high resolution and small pixel pitch are also important to eliminate the “screen door” effect that comes with expanding lower resolution displays over wide fields of view. We continue our development work for a tier-one consumer electronics company customer and are targeting similar levels of brightness on proof-of-concept displays using our full color dPd process.

We derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our OLED microdisplay products. We also earn revenue from commercial, consumer product and government development contracts that may complement and support our internal research and development programs. In addition, we generate sales from optics and microdisplays combined with optics. And finally, as the technology leader in this space, we may see future opportunities to license technologies like dPd to OEMs and other global manufacturers.

We were formed in March 2000, through the merger of Fashion Dynamics Corporation, and FED Corporation, a developer and manufacturer of optical systems and microdisplays for use in the electronics industry. Simultaneous with this merger, we changed our name to eMagin Corporation. We are incorporated in the state of Delaware. 

Our common stock is traded on the NYSE American under the symbol EMAN.




Our Industry

A microdisplay generally has a screen size that is less than two inches in diagonal. The miniature size enables microdisplays to be used in a wide variety of applications that require a screen that takes up small space, such as head-mounted displays or HMDs, weapon sights, and viewfinders of digital cameras. Microdisplays are used across various industries, including the military, commercial, and consumer markets in which we operate. Microdisplays provide many advantages over other displays where small size is a requirement. Benefits include compact size, high brightness and resolution, low power consumption, and high contrast.
Our Technology Platform

Our microdisplays are based upon active matrix small molecule OLED technology, which we refer to as active matrix OLED or AMOLED. Our AMOLED technology permits us to build millions of individual low-voltage light sources on low-cost, silicon computer chips to produce single color, white or full-color display arrays. Our technology allows many computer and video electronic system functions to be built directly into the silicon chip, under the OLED film, resulting in a compact, integrated system with lower overall system costs relative to alternative technologies.

OLEDs are thin films of stable organic materials that emit light of various colors when a voltage is applied to them. OLEDs are emissive devices, which mean that they create their own light, as opposed to liquid crystal displays, which require a separate light source. As a result, our OLED microdisplays use less power and deliver much higher contrast and fuller color than liquid crystal microdisplays. Unlike liquid crystal displays which use crossed polarizers to generate black level, OLED displays exhibit an extremely high contrast ratio which results in very vivid images. Because the light they emit is lambertian, which means that it appears equally bright from most forward directions, a moderate movement in the eye does not change the image brightness or color as it does in some other technologies.

Our technology is based on integrating a proprietary OLED device with a specially designed silicon backplane to produce efficient and high-performance AMOLED microdisplays. Our OLED displays incorporate a proprietary, top-emitting structure for our OLED devices that enables OLED displays to be built on opaque silicon integrated circuits rather than only on glass. Our OLED microdisplays emit full visible spectrum (white) light that is split with color filters to create color images. Our microdisplays’ performance meets or exceeds the requirements for a typical notebook computer or cell phone and is useful for a myriad of applications. New processes and device improvements, such as our OLED-XLS and OLED-XLE technologies, offer even better performance including brightness and efficiency. 

We have developed very bright OLED microdisplays using our patented dPd technology and have demonstrated color high resolution 4K x 4K displays and widescreen ultra-extended graphics array, or WUXGA, microdisplays with brightness in excess of 10,000 nits, which we believe is the world’s highest resolution and brightness OLED microdisplay. In addition to our AMOLED technology, we have developed compact optic and lens enhancements, which when coupled with the microdisplay, help our OEM customers provide a high-quality large screen appearance. In December 2022 we took delivery of an R&D chamber for our OLED deposition tool that will enable us to further enhance this dPd technology. The design process for this R&D chamber has played a key role in defining the specifications for the large production-capable dPd organic deposition tool purchased under Title III funding, that passed acceptance testing at the vendors facility and will be delivered to us in the second quarter of 2023.

We believe that our AMOLED technology provides significant advantages over other microdisplay technologies in our targeted markets. These key advantages include:

high brightness;
sharp contrast;
vivid colors;
low power consumption for improved battery life and longer system life;
high-speed performance resulting in clear video images;
compact form factor and light weight;
wide operating temperature range;
good environmental stability (vibration and humidity); and
anticipated low manufacturing cost at higher volumes.

Our Market Opportunities

We target the military, commercial (in which we include the medical and industrial sectors), and consumer markets with many of our products catering to multiple markets. Within each of these market sectors we believe that our OLED microdisplays, when combined with compact optic lenses, can become a key component for a variety of mobile electronic products. 
Military

We believe eMagin is the only U.S. manufacturer of OLED microdisplays. We believe that head-mounted systems incorporating our high brightness OLED microdisplays increase the user’s effectiveness by allowing hands-free operation and increased situational awareness with sufficient brightness for use in daylight, yet dimmable for nighttime light security. OLED microdisplays possess performance characteristics important to demanding military and commercial (e.g., industrial and medical) applications, including high contrast, wide dimming range, shock and vibration resistance, and insensitivity to high G-forces. The design features and performance characteristics of our OLED microdisplays reduce the size, weight, and power required by current and future military systems, while also providing a wide operating temperature range. The image does not flicker or have color breakup in vibrating environments and the microdisplay’s wide viewing angle allows ease of viewing for long periods. Most important, our OLED’s low power consumption reduces battery weight and, for military applications, reduces constraints on mission length due to battery life. The OLED’s wide operating temperature range is of special interest for military applications because the display can turn on instantly at temperatures far below freezing and can operate at high temperatures such as in desert conditions. We believe that our microdisplay products provide power advantages over other microdisplay technologies, particularly liquid crystal displays which require backlights and heaters and cannot provide instant-on capabilities at low temperatures. Incorporating OLED microdisplays into aviation helmets has been made possible in part by the high brightness, high contrast and other performance features of the OLED technology that we have developed.

Our products’ military applications primarily fall into three broad areas: (1) helmet-mounted and handheld displays for situational awareness and data; (2) night vision/thermal imaging goggles, weapons sights, and handheld viewers; and (3) training and simulation devices. These systems are also well suited for demanding operations including; homeland defense, fire and rescue and urban security.

Situational Awareness. Our OLED microdisplays have been incorporated into a broad range of U.S. and foreign military situational awareness programs. Situational awareness products include head-mounted displays that are used to display images, including digital map, sensor imagery and pilot aviation information. In addition, handheld imagers provide improved situational awareness on the battlefield, as well as in training and simulation. These products can also be combined with a weapon system to give the user the capability to select targets without direct exposure. During 2022, we received orders to sell displays under a program with a prime contractor to support the F-35 Lightning II helmet mounted display systems. These custom designed OLED displays are a key component in providing enhanced contrast and projection of images and symbology display as compared to LCD technology.

Night Vision/Thermal Imaging. Night vision goggles allow the user to see in low light conditions. Most versions include two different technologies: infrared/thermal and image intensification. Third and fourth generation military devices generally use some combination of the two technologies. Thermal imagers detect infrared energy (heat) and convert it into an electronic signal. The resulting signal needs to be presented on a display. Heat sensed by an infrared camera can be very precisely quantified, or measured, allowing the user to not only monitor thermal performance, but also identify and evaluate the relative severity of heat-related problems. Thermal imaging systems can be stand-alone handheld systems or integrated as part of the aiming mechanism for a larger system. Advances in sensor technology, both in sensitivity and resolution as well as economic efficiency, have been the driving factors in the adoption of thermal technologies for military applications. We believe the power efficiency and environmental ruggedness of our products are strong competitive advantages, particularly for smaller handheld non-cooled systems. Fielded products incorporating our OLED microdisplays include Enhanced Night Vision Binocular (ENVG-B), Enhanced Night Vision Goggle II, the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle III, the Javelin CLU medium-range anti-tank missile system, Thermal weapons sights, Laser Targeting Locator Modules, handheld and clip on thermal imagers.

Training and Simulation. Our OLED microdisplays are purchased by OEMs for use with their simulation and training products. Our displays have been commercialized and prototyped for situational awareness and night vision/thermal imaging applications by military systems integrators.

Commercial

We believe that a wide variety of commercial markets (in which we include the medical and industrial sectors) offer significant opportunities for our products due to increasing demand for instant data accessibility in mobile workplace environments and the benefit of mobile displays to enhance visual performance. This market includes night and thermal imaging systems for law enforcement and first responders. Examples of existing and potential microdisplay applications include enhanced visualization for ocular surgery, mobile ultrasound, mobile nondestructive testing, enhanced vision for those with visual impairments, immediate access to inventory records or maintenance and construction manuals, routine quality assurance inspection, and real-time viewing of images and data for a variety of applications. As an example, a user wearing an HMD while operating test equipment, such as an oscilloscope, can view technical data while simultaneously probing printed circuit boards. Current commercial products equipped with our OLED microdisplays in these sectors include those produced by Alcon, AMO Wavefront, IMV (formerly BCF), Liteye, Trijicon, FLIR Systems, and Nordic NeuroLab.
Consumer

We believe a major driver of the longer term near-eye virtual imaging microdisplay market is the growing consumer demand for mobile access to larger volumes of information and entertainment in smaller and more affordable packages. This desire for mobility and immersive content has resulted in the development of mobile video personal viewer products in three general categories: 

immersive VR headset-application platforms such as accessories for gaming computers, and wearable telepresence systems; 
AR glasses and personal viewers for cell phones; and 
low cost thermal and low light imaging incorporated in scopes for hunting and other outdoor activities.

When we are able to manufacture our OLED displays in higher volumes at reduced costs and capitalize on our dPd technology, we believe that our products will be increasingly well positioned to compete with other microdisplays and cell phone size displays in the rapidly growing consumer market, particularly as demand expands for sophisticated mobile personal viewers offering higher resolution and better image quality for VR and AR applications. Users of VR HMDs are demanding a fully immersive experience. We believe our dPd technology addresses the critical performance parameters for next generation VR HMDs, including higher brightness, sharper resolution, lower power consumption, elimination of motion artifacts, and longer life. Our strategy for addressing the consumer mass market includes developing partnerships with both tier-one consumer companies and high-volume production manufacturing companies.

Potential applications for these personal viewers include handheld personal computers and mobile devices, such as smartphones, whose small, direct view screens limit the amount of information that can be displayed but which are now capable of running more complex software applications. Examples encompass applications where hands-free viewing is desired such as entertainment and gaming video headset systems; nighttime or thermal imaging devices for hunting, camping, and other outdoor activities; and maintenance applications. In addition, in late 2015, we entered into a HMD technology licensing agreement with a tier-one consumer electronics company which includes the use of our 2K × 2K displays in its consumer headsets. In first quarter 2017, we entered into an agreement with an additional tier-one company interested in incorporating our proprietary dPd technology into potential headset products. Also during first quarter 2017, we performed tests for a tier-one consumer electronics company demonstrating our dPd technology as a path for AR and VR. We also entered into agreements with tier-one companies to develop a new display design for Virtual Reality, and scale our dPd technology. During 2018, we designed a silicon backplane for this 4K design which is anticipated to have a 100-degree field of view. In late 2018 we received the first silicon wafers based on our 4K design from a foundry, and began testing and applying OLED materials to the wafers in furtherance, of our development efforts. During 2019, we demonstrated a 4K display at a major industry conference. During 2020, we entered into an agreement with another tier-one consumer company to design a display. During 2021, we demonstrated a new prototype for a widescreen ultra-extended graphics array (WUXGA) (1920x1200 pixels) that uses our dPd technology to achieve 10,000 candela per square meter (cd/m2) of maximum luminance, which we believe is the world’s brightest high-resolution, full-color OLED microdisplays. During 2022 we continued work on our dPd display roadmap and made continuing enhancements to our high-brightness XLE process.

Our Products

Our first commercial microdisplay, the super video graphics array, or SVGA+, Active Matrix OLED, was introduced in 2001. In 2008, we introduced engineering samples of our super extended graphics array, or SXGA, 120 OLED microdisplays and began selling significant quantities of the product in 2010. In 2010, we introduced the VGA microdisplay. In late 2011, we began selling pre-production samples of our WUXGA OLED microdisplay which is now qualified and in production. In 2014, we released our Digital SVGA, and in 2015, we released our smaller pixel pitch SXGA096, as well as an upgrade to the SXGA120 and WUXGA displays. Our OLED display products are being designed in products to be manufactured by OEM customers for a wide variety of military, commercial, and consumer applications. We offer our products to OEMs and other buyers as both separate components, integrated bundles coupled with our own optics, or complete systems. We also offer engineering support to enable customers to integrate our products into their own product development programs and design customized displays with resolutions or features to meet specific customer requirements. In 2015, we announced the development of a prototype immersive headset that uses our prototype 2K × 2K display. During 2016, we demonstrated what we believe to be the world’s highest brightness (~4,500 cd/m2) and highest resolution (1920x1200 pixels) microdisplay using our proprietary dPd technology. During 2017, we developed prototype displays of our 2K x 2K display with an advanced backplane design and brightness exceeding 5,000 cd/m2. During 2018, we continued to make improvements in the features and brightness of our displays and achieved over 7,500 nits in our WUXGA displays. We have shipped sample high brightness displays fabricated using our dPd technology to numerous customers. During 2019, we shipped our dPd tool to the vendor for upgrading to enable better performance and yield. Following the upgrade, we received the tool back from the vendor and began fabricating dPd prototypes during the second half of 2020 and have sent samples to customers for evaluation. During 2021, we achieved full color brightness levels of over 10,000 cd/m2 on WUXGA displays which were demonstrated to industry analysts, and exhibited at a tradeshow in customer headsets. After receipt and qualification of an advanced dPd tool which we purchased with the help of government grants, we expect to achieve a brightness level of over 22,000 cd/m2 ready for mass production of full color displays by 2024. During 2021 we completed the manufacturing qualification process for our high-luminance and power-efficient XLE displays and began to ramp production to meet customer demand. Our current XLE displays are qualified at over 1,500 cd/m2. These displays use 

 

eMagin’s existing backplane and are compatible with designs used by many customers, thereby providing an upgrade in luminance levels. Several of the display types listed below are currently available in XLE luminance levels.

SVGA+ OLED Microdisplay Series (Super Video Graphics Array of 852x600)

The SVGA+ OLED Microdisplay Series is a 0.62 inch diagonal microdisplay that has a resolution of 852x600 triad pixels (1.53 million picture elements). The display also has an internal monochrome video decoder for low power night vision systems. The SVGA+ Rev3 OLED-XL microdisplay is a power efficient OLED display solution for near-eye personal viewer applications which uses less than 115 mW power in monochrome for thermal imaging applications, and lower than 175 mW for full color video.
Digital SVGA OLED-XL (800x600)

The Digital SVGA or DSVGA OLED-XL is an 800 × 600 display with 15 micron pixels and a 0.6 inch diagonal. It has all the benefits of our other digital displays, including lower power (100 mW monochrome and 135 mW color), high (10,000 to 1) contrast, and also features a digital composite signal interface, enabling a minimal physical interface for color applications.

SXGA096 OLED-XL/XLS/XLE (Super eXtended Graphics Array, 1280 x 1024)

The SXGA096 display features a 9.6-micron color pixel and was designed with the same level of feature integration as the DSVGA microdisplay, as well as a low pin-count, high speed low voltage differential signaling, or LVDS, data interface. The compactness and high information content of the SXGA096 makes it ideal for small form factor applications such as commercial headsets and smart weapon sights. This microdisplay incorporates OLED XLS technology more than doubling the OLED XL brightness. This expands the range of optical solutions that can be used with this display to result in smaller and lighter display modules.

SXGA OLED-XL (Super eXtended Graphics Array, 1280 x 1024)

Our SXGA OLED microdisplay with a 0.77 inch diagonal active area provides 3,932,160 sub-pixels in an active area. The display’s pixel array comprises triads of vertical sub-pixels stacked side by side to make up each 12 × 12mm color pixel. The SXGA OLED-XL microdisplay offers digital signal processing, requiring less than 200mW under typical operation. The supported video formats are SXGA, 720p, DVGA (through 1280 × 960 pixel doubling), and both frame sequential and field sequential stereovision.

SXGA-120 (Super eXtended Graphics Array, 1292 x 1200)

Our SXGA-120 active array microdisplay is comprised of 1292 x 1036 square pixels with a 12-micron pitch and a 69% fill factor. An extra 12 columns and 12 rows (beyond the 1280 x 1024 main array) are provided to enable the active SXGA-120 display to be shifted by steps of 1 or 2 pixels in the X and Y directions for optical alignment purposes. The SXGA-120 is well suited to use in Weapon and Night Vision Systems using an FPGA and a SXGA or 720P camera source. It shares compatibility with the VGA display allowing for a common drive platform. It is also suitable for use in HMD’s requiring a balance between display size and FOV having a large pixel size making wider FOV easier to accomplish.

VGA OLED-XL (Video Graphics Array, 640 x 480)

The VGA OLED-XL microdisplay is our smallest (0.5 inches) and lowest powered (<60 mW monochrome/<100 mW color). The VGA OLED-XL utilizes the same voltage pixel drive architecture and “deep black” technology as the SXGA and WUXGA designs and includes motion artifact reduction technology like the WUXGA. The VGA interface is 30-bit digital RGB.

WUXGA OLED-XL (Widescreen Ultra eXtended Graphics Array, 1920 x 1200)

Our WUXGA OLED-XL microdisplay provides higher resolution than most high definition, or HD, flat screen televisions. Each full pixel is laid out as three 3.2 x 9.6 micron identical sub-pixels, which together form the 9.6-micron square RGB color group. The WUXGA OLED-XL is built upon the voltage pixel drive approach first developed for the SXGA OLED-XL, which provides improved uniformity, ultra-high contrast (measured at greater than 100,000:1) and lower power. The advanced WUXGA design features our proprietary “deep black” architecture that ensures that off-pixels are truly black, automatically optimizes contrast under all conditions, and delivers better pixel to pixel uniformity. The WUXGA OLED-XL includes a low-power LVDS, serial interface and the overall display power requirement is typically less than 350 mW running standard video. Also included is our proprietary motion enhancement technology which smooths video display and virtually eliminates unwanted artifacts. On-board circuitry ensures consistent color and brightness over a wide range of operating temperatures.




2K x 2K Display (2048 x 2048)

The 2Kx2K Reconfigurable Color OLED-XL (2K_CFXL) active array is comprised of 2072 x 2072 square color pixels with a 9.3-micron pitch and a 75% fill factor. An extra 24 columns and 24 rows (beyond the 2048 x 2048 main array) are provided to enable the 2K_CFXL display to be shifted by steps of 1 pixel in the X and Y directions for optical alignment purposes. Each full pixel is laid out as three 3.1 x 9.3 micron identical sub-pixels, which together form the 9.3-micron square RGB color group. Three primary color filter stripes are applied in alignment with the sub-pixels on a white-emissive OLED layer to form the color display. The 2K is intended for near-to-eye applications that demand high brightness, high resolution, high image quality, compact size, and low power such as virtual reality and avionics systems.

Design Reference Kits

We provide design reference kits, which include a microdisplay and associated electronics, to help OEMs evaluate our microdisplay products and to assist their efforts to build and test new products incorporating our microdisplays. Additionally, we provide license-free source code for these kits (Firmware and FPGA Verilog) to enable our customer to accelerate their time to market.
Integrated Modules

We provide near-eye virtual imaging modules that incorporate our OLED-on-silicon microdisplays with our lenses and electronic interfaces for integration into OEM products. We have shipped customized modules to several customers, some of which have incorporated our products into their own commercial products.
Prism Optics

We sell a high quality, large viewing angle prism optics with a wide range for eye positioning which is essential for incorporating our displays in immersive near-eye systems. This is an advanced molded plastic prism lens that permits our AMOLED microdisplays to provide realistic images that can be viewed for extended periods with reduced eye-fatigue. 
Drive Boards

Through an agreement with Bild Innovative Technology we offer its line of OLED microdisplay compact driver boards to eMagin customers. Under this arrangement, customers now have the option of purchasing eMagin OLED microdisplays together with compact drive boards, thereby streamlining their prototyping efforts. The initial boards available from eMagin will be for SXGA096, SXGA120, and DSVGA resolutions, with more to be added in the future.
Government Contract Revenues and Government Awards

We derive a portion of our revenue from funding that we receive pursuant to research contracts or subcontracts funded by various agencies of the U.S. government. In addition, we have applied for and received U.S. government awards for the purchase of capital equipment.

In June 2020, we announced a $5.5 million award received under the U.S. Department of Defense Industrial Base Analysis, or IBAS, Program for OLED Supply Chain Assurance. In July 2020, we announced a $33.6 million award the U.S. Department of Defense to sustain and enhance U.S. domestic capability for high resolution, high brightness OLED microdisplays that will include equipment to manufacture our dPd displays. These funds are being used to purchase capital equipment over a 33-month period that will increase capacity, improve yields, and sustain operations at our Hopewell Junction, New York headquarters.

During 2022, the U.S. Army’s Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) awarded us a $2.5 million, two-year development contract to secure a U.S. source for a high-performance microdisplay that provides high brightness and visual acuity, even in bright daylight conditions. In 2022, we recognized $1.3 million of revenue under the initial phase of this contract, which was related to the design of a backplane that will allow for significantly higher luminance of our displays. The PEO STRI contract provides that upon completion a follow-on production agreement may be issued without the need for a competitive process.

We earn revenue from contracts with the U.S. government, either directly or funded through contractors that require us to conduct the research effort described in the statement of work section of the contract. These contracts may be modified or terminated at the discretion of the government and are subject to authorization, appropriation and allocation of the required funding on an annual basis.

Commercial Contract Funding 

We also derive a portion of our revenue from funding we receive from development work we perform on behalf of customers in both the military and commercial sectors. During 2022, our efforts towards consumer AR/VR applications continued.

Our Strategy

Our strategy is to strengthen our technology leadership position and our expertise in active matrix OLED technology and silicon wafer design, including our dPd technology. We believe we are the only U.S. OLED microdisplay manufacturer and can capitalize on our experience by supplying microdisplays and virtual imaging technology solutions for applications in military, commercial, and consumer markets, globally.    

We plan to continue our participation in U.S. government funded, and commercial contract research and development programs, which allow us to continue to advance our technology. We aim to provide microdisplays and complementary accessories to enable OEM customers serving a variety of markets, including military, commercial and consumer, to develop and manufacture new and enhanced electronic products. The key elements of our strategy to achieve these objectives include:

Continue to be a valued supplier and partner to our military customers. Our OLED expertise has allowed us to provide displays that meet the demanding requirements of our military customers for integration into night vision and thermal systems, aviation helmets, situational awareness and training systems in service of both U.S. Armed Forces and those of our NATO and other foreign military allies. As a U.S. manufacturer of OLED microdisplays, we afford advantages to U.S. prime contractors who are restricted by military procurement regulations from buying from, or manufacturing sensitive components in China and other restricted countries. Capitalizing on this strategy, in 2020, we received U.S. Department of Defense awards to procure capital equipment to enhance our manufacturing capabilities to produce OLED microdisplays used in several key military programs.

Strengthen our technology leadership. Our advanced backplane designs, intellectual property portfolio coupled with our OLED fabrication techniques and know-how, and dPd technology allow us to produce displays that offer a competitive edge for our customers who integrate our displays into their end products. As the first to utilize AMOLED microdisplays we have a depth of knowledge and expertise, and have specialized manufacturing equipment in our in-house foundry that we believe will enable us to continue to develop performance improvements. We believe that our participation in U.S. government funded contract research and development programs, combined with our continuous investment in OLED research and development, will enable us to continue our technology leadership position. 

Optimize microdisplay manufacturing efficiencies while protecting proprietary processes and partner with large volume manufacturers to bring our technology into high volume production. With the help of equipment to be provided under our U.S. government awards, we intend to reduce our production costs primarily by improving manufacturing yields, eliminate single point of failure equipment, lower fixed costs through reduced cycle time and increased automation. The U.S. government awards will also enable us to procure a dPd tool capable of producing production quantities of these high-brightness, high-resolution displays. We outsource certain portions of microdisplay production, such as chip fabrication, to minimize our costs and time to market. We intend to retain the OLED-related processes in-house, where we have a core competency and manufacturing expertise. We also believe that by keeping these processes under tight control we can better protect our proprietary technology and process know-how. We believe that this strategy will also enhance our ability to continue to optimize and customize processes and devices to meet customer needs. In order to address emerging high volume consumer electronics OLED microdisplay requirements, we are actively seeking manufacturing partners who can help us realize that objective. 

Continue to build and maintain strong design capabilities. We employ in-house design capabilities supplemented by outsourced design services. Building and maintaining this capability allows us to reduce engineering costs, accelerate the design process and enhance design accuracy to respond to our customers’ needs as new markets develop. Contracting third party design support to meet demand and for specialized design skills may also remain a part of our overall long-term strategy. Given these capabilities, we continue to look for opportunities to add value to our displays to increase revenue.

Develop OEM and mass production partnerships in the consumer and commercial HMD market. As the consumer and enterprise AR/VR, market matures, we believe our technology is positioned well to address the requirements of this segment. Developing customer partners is key to establishing eMagin as the market leader for next generation displays for the consumer HMD market. Our potential channels to this market include partnering for the mass production of microdisplays and licensing our dPd technology. We believe that our dPd technology will enable next generation AR/VR hardware for the consumer and enterprise segments because the high brightness and high pixel per inch, or PPI, density afforded by the technology. Should we be successful in executing on mass production partnerships we believe it would allow us to be well positioned to meet the demands of a market predicted to experience significant growth through the 2020s.

Leverage strategic relationships. We have longstanding relationships with the U.S. military and have received technology achievement awards from the U.S. Army Communications – Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center. We also have relationships with many U.S. and international prime military contractors. These and other external relationships serve an important role in our research and development efforts. Suppliers, equipment vendors, government organizations, contract research groups, external design companies, customer and corporate partners, consortia, and university relationships 

 

all enhance the overall research and development effort and help us develop new ideas and solutions. In addition, we participate in industry associations such as the Society for Information Display; SPIE, the International Society for Optics and Photonics; the Army Aviation Association of America; the Association of the United States Army, or AUSA, and the National Defense Industrial Association, among others. We believe that strategic relationships allow us to determine better the demands of the marketplace and, as a result, allow us to focus our research and development activities on satisfying our customers’ evolving requirements.

Expand into new display markets. In the future, technologies like dPd combined with our advanced backplane design capability may open the door to enabling improvements over both traditional displays outside the microdisplay market, including cell phones and other larger scale displays, as well as improving the feasibility of emerging display technologies like microLED. 

Sales and Marketing

We primarily provide our OLED display and optics components to OEMs to incorporate into their branded products and sell through their own well-established distribution channels. We have traditionally marketed and sold our products to customers through targeted selling, promotions, and select advertising. We identify companies with end products and applications for which we believe our products will provide a key differentiator. Marketing efforts focus on identifying prospects and communicating the product performance attributes foremost in the minds of purchasing decision-makers. We believe that this approach positions us to achieve the highest possible return on investment for our marketing expense.

We market our products in North America, Asia, and Europe directly from our sales office located at our Hopewell Junction, New York facilities. We also utilize distributors in Asia and Korea.

An OEM design cycle typically requires between 6 and 36 months, depending on the uniqueness of the market, the complexity of the end product or, in the case of military OEM customers, government procurement schedules. Because our microdisplays are the main functional component that defines many of our customers’ end products, we work closely with customers to provide technical assistance throughout the product evaluation and integration process.

Another element of our marketing strategy is discussions with customers and presentations to existing and potential customers at military, industrial and consumer tradeshows. Trade shows we have exhibited at, or plan to exhibit at include; Shot Show, the largest event for the recreational hunting and shooting market, Defense and Commercial Sensing Exposition sponsored by the International Society for Optics and Photonics, Army Aviation Association of America, Special Operations Force Industry Conference, Defense and Security Equipment International, Association of the United States Army, Eurosatory-France, Land, Naval & Internal Homeland Security Systems Exhibition, the Society for Information Display, Solid State Devices and Materials conference, and the International Meeting on Information Display and OLED World Summit. A key element of our marketing is the expansion of our presence in new, high potential markets. We are experiencing heightened interest and requests for quotation from a variety of international companies that are familiar with the performance of our microdisplays. 

Customers

We sell our products directly to military contractors and OEM’s who use our displays in a diverse range of applications encompassing the military, and commercial (in which we include the medical and industrial market sectors). We classify revenues as either military, commercial, consumer or multiple based on our knowledge of the customer’s products and markets served by our displays. Revenues classified as multiple are for sales to customers that incorporate our displays in products that could be used for either military or commercial applications. We also perform funded R&D activities for both prime contractors, U.S. government defense related agencies, and non-military customers, which are classified as Contract revenues. Product and Contract revenues are disclosed on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We maintain relationships with OEMs in a diverse range of industries encompassing the military, commercial, and consumer market sectors.

Backlog 

As of December 31, 2022, we had a backlog of approximately $14.8 million, an increase of approximately $1.0 million over the backlog of $13.8 million at December 31, 2021. Backlog is comprised of scheduled delivery dates through 2023 of non-binding customer purchase orders and purchase agreements, but does not include expected revenue from research and development contracts or expected non-recurring engineering programs under development. Backlog also does not include purchase orders for which deliveries are not or have not yet been scheduled. Our backlog may vary depending upon the timing of when orders are received and shipment dates scheduled, although we are generally seeing continuing growth in our year-over-year backlog. Variations in the magnitude and duration of purchase orders and customer delivery requirements may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period. Many of our purchase orders allow for rescheduling or cancellation by the customer with no or limited penalties.
Manufacturing Facilities 

Our manufacturing facilities are located in Hopewell Junction, New York. We currently lease approximately 63,000 square feet of space, which houses our equipment for OLED microdisplay fabrication and research and development. This includes a 16,300 square foot class 10 clean room space, an additional 7,910 square foot class 10 clean room space to be completed in April 2023, additional lower level clean room testing space, assembly space, and administrative offices. At the end of the lease term we have two five-year options to extend the lease.

Facilities services provided by the lessor at our expense include our clean room, pure gases, high purity de-ionized water, compressed air, chilled water systems, and waste disposal support. This infrastructure provided by our lease provides us with many of the resources of a larger corporation without the added overhead costs. It further allows us to focus our resources more efficiently on our product development and manufacturing goals.

We employ a variety of specialized equipment in our manufacturing processes, including anode organic deposition tools, various sealing equipment, dicers, wire bonding equipment, heat testing ovens, and others.

We believe manufacturing efficiency is an important factor for success, across all of our markets. As previously announced, we have been designing, specifying, and ordering advanced OLED manufacturing equipment under our $33.6 million in Defense Production Act Title III funding and $5.5 million IBAS funding grants. We have placed orders for all major pieces of equipment funded by these programs, including an order for an advanced, production-capable dPd organic deposition tool that is expected to improve yield and throughput of this innovative technology by the end of 2023. Overall, the Company remains on track and within requirements of the U.S. Defense Production Act Title III and IBAS funding grants and anticipate improvements in manufacturing yield and reliability over the next 24 months as this equipment is qualified and added to the production line. The new equipment will help us increase capacity and yield for all display types, address critical productions points, and replace certain older equipment, which we expect will aid us in meeting expected demand for our microdisplays. 

Competition

The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We face competition from legacy technologies such as transmissive liquid crystal displays from Kopin Corporation, and liquid crystal on silicon displays as well as from alternative display technologies such as virtual scanning retinal displays. There are many large and small companies that manufacture or have in development products based on these technologies.

We believe we are the only company with U.S.-based manufacturing capability for OLED microdisplays. There are other non-U.S. based manufacturers of high-resolution OLED microdisplays that produce microdisplays that compete with our microdisplay products. They are Yunnan OLiGHTEK Opto-Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. in China, SeeYA Technology in China, and MicroOLED in France. Both are shipping OLED microdisplays into the market. Sony Mobile Display Corp., in Japan, produces OLED microdisplays for integration into Sony’s own higher-level systems such as digital cameras and HMDs and is now selling microdisplays to some commercial customers. 

In addition, there are several manufacturing facilities in China to build OLED microdisplays for the consumer AR/VR marketplace that came online. If other new OLED-based companies enter our markets, we will face additional competition.

 


In addition, we compete with liquid crystal on silicon displays (LCOS), small transmissive liquid crystal displays (LCD), and OLED microdisplays manufactured by competitors. While we believe our OLED technology is technically superior by providing higher quality images, greater environmental ruggedness, reduced electronics cost and complexity, and improved power efficiency microdisplays, there is no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively. Competition can also come from inorganic micro LEDs, a technology still in the development stage but which could become a major competitor if all the technological hurdles are overcome.

Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. These factors to include:

our ability to design, manufacture and deliver new products, including those implementing dPd, on a timely basis;
our ability to address the needs of our customers;
the quality, performance, reliability, features, ease of use and pricing of our products;
successful expansion of our manufacturing capabilities;
our efficiency of production, and ability to manufacture and ship products on time;
the rate at which OEM customers incorporate our product solutions into their own products;
the market acceptance of our customers’ products; and
product or technology introductions by our competitors.

In addition, our customers may be reluctant to rely on a relatively small company such as eMagin for a critical component. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competition, and the failure to do so would have a materially adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.

Intellectual Property 

We have developed an intellectual property portfolio of patents, trade secrets and manufacturing know-how. Our intellectual property includes 50 issued U.S. patents and 14 pending U.S. patent applications. We also have 22 issued foreign patents and 12 pending foreign patent applications. It is important to protect our investment in technology by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights, including rights under patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws. We seek to protect inventions we consider significant by applying for patents in the United States and other countries when appropriate. The U.S. government holds data rights to some of our technology as a result of its funding a portion of our research and development. In 2022, we were awarded four patents related to the creation of high-resolution displays with unique pixel structures and proprietary fabrication methods.

Our intellectual property covers a wide range of materials, device structures, processes, and fabrication techniques, primarily concentrated in the following areas:

OLED devices, architecture, structures, and processes;
display color processing and sealing;
active matrix circuit methodologies and designs;
lenses and tracking (eye and head);
ergonomics and industrial design;
wearable computer interface methodology;
legacy field emission and general display technologies; and
head-mounted display technology.

We believe that, in addition to patent protection, our success is dependent upon trade secrets, technical expertise, and know-how. To protect this information and know-how from unauthorized use or disclosure, we use nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights, and we require all employees and, where appropriate, contractors, consultants, advisors, and collaborators, to enter into confidentiality and non-competition agreements. In addition, we work to continually improve our IT security posture through, among other things; network monitoring, enhancements to firewalls, antivirus and malware prevention software, email spam blockers, and end user security training. We believe that our intellectual property portfolio, coupled with our strategic relationships and accumulated manufacturing know-how in OLED, gives us a significant advantage over potential competitors.

U.S. Government Regulation

We are subject to certain export control laws, including the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR. Certain of our products may be deemed to be controlled for export by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, under the EAR or by the U.S. State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, or DDTC, under the ITAR. Our ITAR products are custom displays developed for a specific military program or purpose. Failure to comply with these export control laws can lead to severe penalties, both civil and criminal, and can include debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.
Environmental Law Compliance

Our operations are subject to various governmental regulations related to toxic, volatile, experimental, and other hazardous chemicals used in our design and manufacturing process. While we continue to incur costs to comply with environmental regulations, we do not believe that such costs will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Although we believe that we are currently in material compliance with all applicable environmental regulations, we cannot be certain that we or our suppliers have not in the past violated applicable laws or regulations, which violations could result in required remediation or other liabilities. We also cannot be certain that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will protect us from required remediation or other liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations. Any failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in the imposition of fines or in the suspension or cessation of our operations.
Employees 

As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 109 employees, of which 107 were full time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Human Capital

Oversight and Management

Our Human Resources organization is tasked with leading our organization in managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, talent management and development. We are committed to providing team members with the training and resources necessary to continually strengthen their skills. Our executive team is responsible for periodically reviewing team member programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices. Management periodically reports to the Board and its committee’s human capital measures and results that guide how we attract, retain and develop a workforce to enable our business strategies.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to monitor and improve the application of our hiring, retention, compensation and advancement processes for women and underrepresented populations across our workforce, including our team members of color, veterans and LGBTQ to enhance our inclusive and diverse culture. We continue to invest in recruiting diverse talent.

We strive to have a diverse culture of employees representing different genders, ages, ethnicities, sexual orientation, gender identity and abilities.

Workplace Safety and Health

A vital part of our business is providing our workforce with a safe, healthy and sustainable working environment. Our Environmental, Health and Safety program focuses on implementing change through employee observation and feedback channels to recognize risk and continuously improve our processes, as well as conducting regular risk reviews and self-audits at our manufacturing facility to explore new opportunities to reduce potential employee exposure to occupational injuries.

Our experience and continuing focus on workplace safety have enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues and workplace visitors safe. We have established a team to monitor new safety related developments, including future pandemics, and support our operations to respond to the ever-changing landscape.

The team consists of our Executive Management team, Human Resources, Manufacturing, IT, and Safety, and provides updates to the Board of Directors. The team’s goals are to:

support safe working environments in our operations;
regularly communicate to inform and update employees; and
provide oversight of training on safety practices.

We took immediate action at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to enact rigorous safety protocols in our facilities by improving sanitation measures, implementing mandatory social distancing, temperature screening, use of facing coverings, reducing on-site staff through staggered shifts and schedules, remote working where possible, and restricting visitor access to our locations. These actions, in addition to generally being deemed an essential business, will prepare us to continue operating our business with minimal disruptions during safety events, or other future pandemics.
