ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Introduction 
 We are a blank check company incorporated on December 22, 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We are an emerging growth company and, as such, we are subject to all of the risks associated with emerging growth companies. Prior to executing the Merger Agreement, our efforts were limited to organizational activities, completion of the our initial public offering and the evaluation of possible business combinations. We have generated no operating revenues to date and do not expect that we will generate operating revenues prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. 
Initial Public Offering and Simultaneous Private Placement 
 On March 1, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 28,750,000 units, which includes the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 3,750,000 units, at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating aggregate gross proceeds of $287,500,000. Each unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, and one-third of one public warrant. UBS Securities LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. acted as the representatives of the several underwriters in our initial public offering. The units sold in the initial public offering were registered under the Securities Act on a registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-252892), which the SEC declared effective on February 9, 2021. Simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, we consummated the sale of 5,166,667 private placement warrants to the Sponsor at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating total proceeds of $7,750,000. Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per Class A ordinary share, subject to adjustment. 
Offering Proceeds Held in Trust 
 Following our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of $287,500,000 was placed in the trust account. We incurred $16,473,310 in offering costs, consisting of $5,750,000 of underwriting discount, $10,062,500 of deferred underwriting discount, and $660,810 of other offering costs. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and marketable securities held in the trust account of $287,610,757, net of redemptions. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions), to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest from the trust account to pay our taxes. To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash of $381,400 held outside of the trust account. We have used the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses (culminating in the selection of Pagaya as the target of our initial business combination), perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and eventually structure, negotiate, and consummate the Business Combination. 
 We may withdraw from the trust account interest earned on the funds held therein necessary to pay its income taxes, if any. Except as described in the prospectus for the initial public offering and described in the subsection herein entitled “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” these proceeds will not be released until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination (including the Business Combination) or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares upon our failure to consummate a business combination within the required time period.

  Merger Agreement and Subscription Agreement 
 On September 15, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Pagaya and Merger Sub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with EJFA continuing as the surviving company after the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pagaya. As a result of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, EJFA will become a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Pagaya. The Merger Agreement and the Transactions were unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of EJFA and Pagaya. At the closing of the Business Combination and the effective time of the Merger, the shareholders of the Company will receive ordinary shares, no par value, of Pagaya, and Pagaya expects to list certain of its ordinary shares and warrants on Nasdaq. 
 In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Pagaya and an affiliate of EJFA (the “EJF Investor”) entered into a subscription agreement (the “EJF Subscription Agreement”), pursuant to which the EJF Investor committed to purchase, in the aggregate, up to 20 million Pagaya Class A ordinary shares at $10.00 per share for an aggregate commitment amount of up to $200 million on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein (the “PIPE Investment”). The obligation of the parties to consummate the PIPE Investment under the EJF Subscription Agreement is conditioned upon, among other things, the conditions to the closing of the Business Combination having been satisfied. Subsequently, Pagaya also entered into additional subscription agreements with certain other investors, pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in such subscription agreements, such investors have agreed to purchase, and Pagaya has agreed to sell to them, 22.2 million Pagaya Class A ordinary shares at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, which shares reduced the foregoing commitment of the EJF Investor by 7.2 million shares. The closing of the PIPE Investment is expected to occur substantially concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 In accordance with the rules of Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) or from an independent accounting, valuation or appraisal firm with respect to satisfaction of such criteria. Our shareholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
 We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. 
 For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and 
 
5 

  outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. 
 To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with existing management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information made available to us. We benefit from our affiliation with EJF and EJF’s capital markets relationships to provide us a consistent flow of, and access to, attractive acquisition targets. Additionally, members of our management team and of our board of directors have significant executive management and public company experience, and accordingly have developed a deep network of contacts and relationships that will provide us with an important source of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that opportunities will be brought to our attention by various unaffiliated sources, including investment banks, private equity groups, consultants, accounting firms and other investment market participants. 
 Liquidation if No Merger 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only 24 months from the close of the initial public offering to consummate an initial business combination, which is March 1, 2023. If we do not consummate an initial business combination within the completion window, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account and not previously released to us to pay tax obligations, if any, (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of public shares then in issue, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining members and the directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of the foregoing sub-articles (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that, if a resolution of our public shareholders is passed pursuant to the Companies Act to commence the voluntary liquidation of our company, we will follow the foregoing procedures, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law. The Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination by March 1, 2023 (or such later date as may be approved by our shareholders in in an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association). However, if our Sponsor or management team acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-month time period. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be 
 
6 

  reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. In addition, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within by March 1, 2023 or with respect to other specified provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity. The redemption rights will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may acquire during or after our initial public offering in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 
 Limitation on Redemption Rights 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Class A ordinary shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering) for or against our initial business combination. 
Redemption of Public Shares 
 Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only until March 1, 2023 to complete our initial business combination. If we have not completed our initial business combination by March 1, 2023 or during any Extension Period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law, in which case our public shareholders may only receive $10.00 per share, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by March 1, 2023, as may be extended by any Extension Period.

  Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we have encountered intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. 
Employees 
 We currently have four officers: Neal Wilson, our vice chairman, Kevin Stein, our chief executive officer; Thomas Mayrhofer, our chief financial officer; and Erika Gray, our chief accounting officer and secretary. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. Thus far, they have devoted all the time that was necessary to identify and evaluate potential business combinations and to select and engage with Pagaya in the Merger Agreement and the Transactions contemplated by such agreement. If the business combination is not completed as planned, the amount of time they will continue to devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees after the consummation of the Business Combination.
