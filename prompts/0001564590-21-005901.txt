Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 We are a pharmaceutical company primarily focused on developing and commercializing innovative products for hospital and related acute care settings. We believe that we can bring valuable therapeutic options for patients, prescribers and payers to the hospital and related acute care markets.
 Our first commercial product, ANJESO, had its New Drug Application, or NDA, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on February 20, 2020 for the management of moderate to severe pain, alone or in combination with other non-NSAID analgesics. Because of delayed onset of analgesia, ANJESO alone is not recommended for use when rapid onset of analgesia is required. ANJESO is a once daily intravenous, or IV, NSAID with preferential Cox-2 activity, which has successfully completed three Phase III studies, including two pivotal efficacy trials, a large double-blind Phase III safety trial and other safety studies for the management of moderate to severe pain. Overall, the total NDA program included over 1,400 patients. We have established sales management, marketing and reimbursement functions in connection with the commercialization of ANJESO in the United States.
 We commenced our commercial launch of ANJESO in June of 2020. We utilize an internal sales team and collaborate with third parties who market ANJESO to health care professionals at called-on institutions for the commercialization of ANJESO in the United States. We continue to evaluate strategic partnerships to commercialize ANJESO outside of the United States. In August 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, established a new permanent J-code for ANJESO, which became effective on October 1, 2020, facilitating reimbursement of ANJESO in the hospital outpatient, ambulatory surgery center and physician office settings of care. We have also entered into agreements with leading group purchasing organizations in the U.S., including Vizient Inc., and Premier Inc., as well as one of the top 3 integrated delivery networks for terms for availability of ANJESO to their member institutions. Over 65 institutions added ANJESO to their formulary. The number of vials sold to end-customers has increased 58% in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus the third quarter of 2020. The number of vials sold to hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers increased over 80% during the same time period. The average quarterly orders per account increased over 60% in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus the third quarter of 2020 and the re-order rate is approximately 55% with a deepening usage pattern.  
 Our pipeline also includes other early-stage product candidates, including two novel neuromuscular blocking agents, or NMBAs, and a related proprietary chemical reversal agent and Dex-IN, a proprietary intranasal formulation of dexmedetomidine, or Dex, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that we are evaluating for possible partnering. 
 Products and Pipeline
 
Separation from Recro
 We separated from Recro on November 21, 2019 as a result of a special dividend distribution of all the outstanding shares of our common stock to Recro shareholders, which we refer to as the Separation. On November 21, 2019, the distribution date, each Recro shareholder received one share of Baudax Bio’s common stock for every two and one-half shares of Recro common stock, or the Distribution, held of record at the close of business on November 15, 2019, the record date for the Distribution. As a result of the Distribution, we are an 
 5


independent public company whose shares of common stock are trading under the symbol “BXRX” on The Nasdaq Capital Market, or Nasdaq.
 Our Strategy
 We believe that we can bring valuable therapeutic options for patients, prescribers and payers, such as ANJESO, to the hospital and acute care markets. We believe we can create value for our shareholders through the commercialization of ANJESO and the development, registration and commercialization of our other pipeline product candidates. In addition to our pipeline, we continue to evaluate acquisition and in-licensing opportunities, especially those that can contribute revenue and cash flow. 
 Our near-term goals include: 
  
• | Successful commercialization of ANJESO. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Pursuing the license or acquisition of additional products. We are seeking in-license or acquisition opportunities to add commercial or near-commercial products to our portfolio. We have established sales management, marketing and reimbursement functions for the commercialization of ANJESO in the United States and we believe we can utilize this infrastructure for the successful commercialization of an acquired or licensed product.
• | Leveraging our development experience to progress our other pipeline product candidates. Our early-stage product pipeline includes proprietary product candidates for use in anesthesia (neuromuscular blockade and reversal). Our goal is to leverage our drug development expertise to develop these product candidates for use in hospital and acute care settings. 

Our Lead Product - ANJESO
 ANJESO is a once a day, preferential COX-2 inhibitor that possesses analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic activities. This proprietary injectable form of IV meloxicam, which utilizes NanoCrystal® technology, increases overall drug solubility that provides a faster onset of action of meloxicam and provides a rapid treatment of acute pain, which lasts for approximately 24 hours. 
Post-Operative Pain Market
 Based upon information from the National Center for Health Statistics, it is estimated that there are over 100 million surgeries performed in the United States each year. Of these surgeries, we believe at least 50 million procedures require post-operative pain medication. Additionally, despite efforts to improve the provision of perioperative analgesia, the proportion of patients reporting moderate to severe pain after surgery has remained constant over the past decade.
 While opioids provide effective analgesia for post-operative pain, their use is increasingly limited due to the known side effects of nausea, vomiting, constipation, respiratory depression, the development of tolerance and the potential for impact on addiction, misuse and abuse. Due to the potential for abuse, opioids are regulated as controlled substances and are listed on Schedule II and III by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA. According to a January 2016 article in the New England Journal of Medicine, overdose deaths from prescription painkillers (defined to mean opioid or narcotic pain relievers) increased significantly over the past 14 years and emergency department visits involved with misusing or abusing prescription opioid painkillers increased 153% between 2004 and 2011. In the acute care setting, and according to the Joint Commission Sentinel Event Alert on the Safe Use of Opioids in Hospitals, opioid analgesics rank among the drugs most frequently associated with adverse drug events. As a result of the addictive potential and side effects, pain sufferers tend to limit their use of opioids, resulting in as many as 40% of post-operative patients reporting inadequate pain relief. This can reduce the quality of life for individuals and, according to an August 2012 article in the Journal of Pain, creates an economic burden estimated to be at least $560 to $635 billion a year in medical costs and lost productivity.
 Efforts to improve pain control with multimodal analgesia are being recommended by many medical societies as a way to decrease opioid-related morbidity and mortality. Multimodal analgesia, or MMA, refers to the use of two or more drugs or nonpharmacologic interventions with differing mechanisms. Its use has been demonstrated to limit the amount of opioids consumed and provide more effective pain control than opioids alone. Effective MMA may further lessen the cost burden and personal toll of opioid-centric regimens. According to an April 2013 article in Pharmacotherapy, opioid-related adverse events negatively impact patients and the healthcare system and cause a 55% longer length of hospital stay, 47% higher cost of care, 36% higher 30-day readmission rates and a 3.4% higher risk of inpatient mortality.
 We believe that ANJESO offers an attractive alternative for relief of moderate to severe pain without the risks associated with opioids. We also believe it can be an important part of an MMA approach for patients in the post-operative setting. Accordingly, we believe that physicians, hospitals and third-party payers, including Integrated Delivery Systems (IDNs), Medicare and Medicaid, are interested in new non-opioid pain therapies that provide effective post-operative pain relief without the adverse issues associated with opioids.

ANJESO (meloxicam) Injection Advantages
 We believe ANJESO has a number of advantages over existing analgesics, including the following:
 Does not cause respiratory depression. Meloxicam does not cause respiratory depression. Besides the addictive nature of opioids, we believe that medical practitioners are highly concerned with respiratory depression, which is a well-documented side effect of opioid use (all opioids, including morphine, fentanyl and oxycodone). Respiratory depression, which is defined by inadequate ventilation leading to increased carbon dioxide levels and respiratory acidosis, is an established outcome of opioid use and requires significant patient monitoring in the acute care setting. One of the more concerning adverse effects of chronic opioid use, for which tolerance does not develop, is respiratory depression during sleep, which can be life-threatening. ANJESO has demonstrated through multiple clinical trials and patient use that it does not cause respiratory depression.
 Not a controlled substance. Meloxicam is not an opioid and not a controlled substance. Opioid therapeutics are currently controlled by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act. Under this act, opioids have been scheduled based on their potential for abuse and/or addiction. For those opioids placed in Schedule II, federal law prohibits the refilling of prescriptions, thus requiring patients to request, and physicians to write, additional prescriptions for each refill. Examples of Schedule II opioids include morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil, hydrocodone and oxycodone.
 Duration of pain relief. ANJESO has demonstrated the potential to be an effective analgesic for up to 24 hours after a single dose in clinical trials. Injectable forms of ketorolac, ibuprofen and acetaminophen provide effective pain relief up to four to six hours, resulting in the need for four to six doses per day.
 Administration. We believe that ANJESO has an administration advantage in terms of being administered by bolus injection, whereas ibuprofen and acetaminophen can take up to 15 to 30 minutes to be infused.
 GI Tolerability. Unlike opioids, the mechanism of action of meloxicam provides analgesic activity with limited impact on gastrointestinal motility thus limiting the common unwanted side effects of opioids, referred to as Opioid Induced Bowel Dysfunction, or OIBD. OIBD comprises several symptoms including constipation, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux, delayed digestion, abdominal pain, flatulence, bloating, hard stool, straining during bowel movement and incomplete evacuation.
 Reduction of Opioid Consumption. Reducing opioid use inside and outside the hospital is becoming more of a priority for physicians and hospital administrators. ANJESO has demonstrated the potential to relieve serious pain while reducing overall opioid consumption. ANJESO also demonstrated a potential greater reduction in opioid use in patients over 65 years old with mild renal impairment in clinical trials.
Commercial Strategy
 On February 20, 2020, we announced the FDA approved the NDA for ANJESO, which is indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain, alone or in combination with other non-NSAID analgesics. Limitation of Use: Because of delayed onset of analgesia, ANJESO alone is not recommended for use when rapid onset of analgesia is required.
 We believe that ANJESO may have a positive value proposition based on our current clinical data. Based on our market research, a new analgesic would be perceived to have a strong value proposition if it can: (1) reduce opioid consumption, (2) allow ambulatory surgical centers to perform more complex procedures and discharge patients on the same day, and (3) allow hospitals to safely speed up patient discharge, reduce inpatient admission and/or length of stay.
 Our efforts to commercialize ANJESO have been impacted and may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals have reduced elective surgeries, and many have not yet returned to their prior number of surgeries even where the pandemic has, for a time, abated. In addition, COVID-19 has, in many cases, impacted revenue for hospitals, caused a reduction in hospital staffing, lead to a diversion in resources from other normal activities to patients suffering from COVID-19 and caused a limitation in hospital access for nonpatients, including our sales professionals, which we believe is impacting our marketing and commercialization efforts. We believe a reduction in elective surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to result in decreased demand for ANJESO.
 In spite of the COVID-19 challenges on our commercialization efforts, we have generated some early commercial experience with ANJESO at settings that have lower barriers to new product adoption and/or have an appetite to use newer therapies. We initially targeted approximately 1,500 hospitals and associated hospital outpatient departments, or HOPDs, and 600 ambulatory surgical centers, or ASCs, which together represented approximately 12.6 million patients across all settings of care. We refocused our efforts in November 2020 due to the challenges further presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and our current customer facing commercial team, which includes approximately 30 individuals in roles ranging from sales, sales management, account management and reimbursement. We have deployed a contracted telesales team who expands our customer outreach to target hospitals and ASCs. We also have a medical affairs team. 
 We believe this focused approach will help educate health care professionals, support formulary review processes and continue to generate early adoption. We believe it is important to continue to educate surgeons (e.g., orthopedic, colorectal and general) and anesthesiologists that practice at multiple settings of care within the acute care market, including ASCs, hospital outpatient departments, 
 7


and hospitals (often referred to as the “hospital inpatient setting”). We have found that some ASCs and small to mid-sized hospitals have lower barriers to adoption and have incorporated ANJESO into some of their post-operative pain management protocols. We believe early success in commercializing ANJESO with ASC’s could lead to increased adoption of ANJESO in hospital outpatient settings, and ultimately hospital inpatient settings.
 Clinical Development
 Multiple clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and analgesic effect of injectable meloxicam. Based on the results of these trials, we believe injectable meloxicam has the potential to be a potent analgesic used in the management of moderate to severe pain. injectable meloxicam has successfully completed two pivotal Phase III clinical trials, a large double-blind Phase III safety trial as well as four Phase II trials and additional pharmacokinetics/safety studies. Overall, we enrolled a total of approximately 1,400 patients in our Phase II/III programs. In addition, we have evaluated the results of injectable meloxicam in Phase IIIb clinical trials in colorectal surgery patients and orthopedic surgery patients that were completed in 2019. Per the Pediatric Study Plan Agreement with FDA, two clinical trials will be conducted in the pediatric population. These trials will be initiated following NDA approval of injectable meloxicam and after appropriate regulatory and institutional review board, or IRB, review.
Phase IIIb Clinical Trials
 We have evaluated the results of injectable meloxicam from a Phase IIIb program that included clinical trials in colorectal surgery patients and orthopedic surgery patients to assess opioid consumption, pain intensity and length of hospital stay with associated pharmacoeconomic parameters. 
Phase III Clinical Trials
 Study REC-15-016
 In this pivotal clinical trial, evaluating pain relief over a 48-hour period in a hard tissue, post-operative pain model (bunionectomy), injectable meloxicam achieved the primary endpoint of a statistically significant difference in Summed Pain Intensity Difference, or SPID, over the first 48 hours, or SPID48, compared to placebo. This was a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, multi-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating injectable meloxicam in the management of post-operative pain following bunionectomy surgery. Two hundred and one patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomized to receive either injectable meloxicam (30 mg) or placebo once daily for up to three days. Following the beginning of treatment, patients remained under observation for 48 hours at study centers. Patients were followed for 28 days after the initial dose of study medication. There was an oral opioid rescue treatment available to all patients, if required. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate pain relief over a 48-hour period of injectable meloxicam when administered as a bolus injection.
 The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was SPID48, utilizing a windowed 2-hour last observation carried forward, or W2LOCF, analysis method. Secondary efficacy endpoints included use of opioid rescue medication, SPIDs over various time intervals, and patient global assessment, or PGA, of pain control. The injectable meloxicam treatment arm demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in SPID48 (p=0.0034) compared to the placebo arm (Figure 1).
 Figure 1: SPID48

The study also achieved the majority of secondary endpoints, including statistically significant differences in SPID6 (p=0.0153), SPID12 (p=0.0053), SPID24 (p=0.0084), SPID24-48 (p=0.0050), time to first use of rescue medication (p=0.0076), and several other rescue use and pain relief metrics during the first 48 hours, compared to placebo. Times to Perceptible and Meaningful Pain Relief, % Subjects with >50% Improvement within 6 Hours, and PGA of Pain Control at 24 hours were not significantly different between treatment groups.
 The safety results demonstrated that injectable meloxicam was well tolerated with no serious adverse events, or SAEs, or bleeding events in the injectable meloxicam-treated patients. The most common adverse events, or AEs, occurring in at least 3% of injectable meloxicam-treated patients, were nausea, headache, pruritus, constipation, vomiting, dizziness, flushing and somnolence, and the incidence of these 
 8


AEs was generally comparable to the placebo group. The injectable meloxicam-treated patients experienced injection site pain and injection site erythema at a rate comparable to placebo. The majority of treatment emergent AEs, or TEAEs, were mild in nature and there were no discontinuations due to AEs. There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in vital signs, electrocardiogram, or ECGs, or clinical lab assessments.
 Study REC-15-015
 In the second of our two Phase III pivotal clinical trials, evaluating pain relief over a 24-hour period in a soft tissue, post-operative pain model (abdominoplasty), injectable meloxicam achieved the primary endpoint of a statistically significant difference in SPID over the first 24 hours, or SPID24, compared to placebo. This was a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, multi-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating injectable meloxicam in the management of post-operative pain following abdominoplasty surgery. Two hundred nineteen patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomized to receive either injectable meloxicam (30 mg) or placebo once daily for up to three days. Following the beginning of treatment, patients remained under observation for 48 hours at study centers. Patients were followed for 28 days after the initial dose of study medication. There was an oral opioid rescue treatment available to all patients, if required. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate pain relief over a 24-hour period of injectable meloxicam when administered as a bolus injection (over 15-30 seconds).
 The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was SPID24 (0-24), utilizing a W2LOCF analysis method. Secondary efficacy endpoints included use of opioid rescue medication, SPIDs over various time intervals, time to pain relief and PGA of pain control. The injectable meloxicam treatment arm demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in SPID24 (p=0.0145) compared to the placebo arm (Figure 2).
 Figure 2: SPID24

The study also achieved statistical significance for 10 of the secondary endpoints, including statistically significant differences in SPID12 (p=0.0434), time to perceptible pain relief (p=0.0050), subjects with ≥30% improvement at 24 hours (p=0.0178), number of times patients required rescue in the first 24 hours after randomization (p=0.0275), as well as number of times rescued from 24 to 48 hours (p=0.0009), and several other pain relief metrics, compared to placebo.
 SPID6, Times to Meaningful Pain Relief and First Rescue, Number of Subjects rescued 0-24 and 0-48 hours, % Subjects with ≥30 and ≥50% Improvement within 6 Hours and ≥50% within 24 hours, and PGA of Pain Control at 24 hours were not significantly different between treatment groups.
 The safety results demonstrated that injectable meloxicam was well tolerated with no difference in SAEs related to bleeding for injectable meloxicam treated patients versus placebo (1 each). There were two additional SAEs observed in the placebo group. The most common (at least 3% in the injectable meloxicam group) AEs were nausea, headache, vomiting, and dizziness. The incidence of these events was lower than those observed in the placebo group. The majority of AEs were mild in nature and one patient in the placebo group discontinued treatment due to an adverse event of post-procedural bleeding. There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in vital signs, ECGs or clinical lab assessments.
 Safety Study
 Injectable meloxicam has also successfully completed a double-blind, randomized Phase III safety study evaluating injectable meloxicam (30mg bolus injection) or placebo following major surgery. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of injectable meloxicam 30mg vs. placebo through Day 28 following treatment. The clinical trial demonstrated that the adverse event profile of injectable meloxicam 30mg was consistent with previously completed clinical trials and was similar to placebo reported events.

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial and included patients who had undergone major elective surgical procedures which were expected to result in hospitalization for at least 24-48 hours. Major surgical procedures included total hip and knee replacements, spinal, GI, hernia repair, and gynecologic surgeries, as well as a range of other surgeries. Patient demographics were balanced across treatment groups and included 40% male patients and about 23% of patients who were over age 65. Unlike the pivotal efficacy trials, minimum pain scores were not required for treatment. Sites were permitted to use opioids and other pain management modes according to their “standard of care” and meloxicam or placebo was added to this regimen in a randomized, double-blind manner. Patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either injectable meloxicam 30mg or injectable placebo daily for up to 7 doses. A total of 721 patients received at least one dose of study medication.
 The most common (≥3%) AEs observed in the injectable meloxicam 30mg treatment group (n=538) are listed in the table below:
 
 
 | Injectable Meloxicam | 
-------------------------------------------+----------------------+----
Preferred Term | 30 mg N = 538 | | | Placebo N = 183 | 
Subjects with ≥1 AE | | 339 | (63.0) | | 119 | (65.0)
Nausea | | 123 | (22.9) | | 51 | (27.9)
Constipation | | 51 | (9.5) | | 17 | (9.3) 
Vomiting | | 27 | (5.0) | | 14 | (7.7) 
Pruritis | | 21 | (3.9) | | 10 | (5.5) 
Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) increased | | 21 | (3.9) | | 5 | (2.7) 
Headache | | 20 | (3.7) | | 12 | (6.6) 
Anemia | | 18 | (3.3) | | 4 | (2.2) 

 In patients age 65 and over, the percentage of patients reporting at least one AE was approximately 7% less in the injectable meloxicam 30mg treatment arm compared to the placebo arm. The total occurrence of patients with at least one SAE was observed to be lower in the injectable meloxicam 30mg group, 2.6%, than in the placebo group, 5.5%. In this safety study only two SAE events were listed as possibly related to study treatment. Both of these SAEs occurred in one placebo treated patient. No deaths were reported in either treatment group. Approximately 3% of patients in each study group discontinued. 
 There were no meaningful clinical differences between treatment groups in vital signs, ECGs, clinical lab assessments and surgeon satisfaction with wound healing. Overall, there was low incidence of clinically significant wound healing abnormalities, as scored by the primary investigator, in both treatment groups (~2%). The meloxicam group had 4/538 patients with more than one attribute scored “clinically significant”, while in placebo, 1/183 patients were scored “clinically significant” for only one attribute. 
 In addition, mean opioid consumption for the total population was lower in the injectable meloxicam 30mg group compared with placebo at all evaluated intervals; Hour 0-24, Hour 24-48, Hour 48-72 and Hour 0-72 intervals, or the full treatment period. There was also a significant increase in time to first use of opioids in the injectable meloxicam 30mg treatment arm, compared to placebo.  Mean opioid consumption in the injectable meloxicam group was lower than the placebo group at all evaluated intervals in the subgroups of Orthopedic Surgeries, Total Knee Replacements, and subjects >65 years with Mild Renal Impairment, as depicted in the table below.

 Our Other Pipeline Candidates
 While our current priority is the commercialization of ANJESO, our pipeline also includes other earlier stage product candidates including intermediate and short-acting NMBAs, and accompanying reversal agents, DEX-IN, along with other product candidates that we may choose to develop for use in hospital or related settings.
 NMBAs
 Neuromuscular blocking agents are used as muscle paralyzing agents to facilitate intubation and surgery. We are developing an intermediate-acting NMBA, BX1000, an ultrashort-acting NMBA, BX2000, and a reversal agent specific to our NMBAs.  The table 
 10


below summarizes the predicted onset and duration of activity for each NMBA based on currently available data, as well as the development status of each NMBA:
 
 
Compound | Onset Time | Duration of Activity | Status 
---------+------------+----------------------+-------------
BX1000 | Rapid | Intermediate acting | Phase I 
BX2000 | Rapid | Ultra-short acting | Pre-clinical

 
In animal models, the proprietary reversal agent acts quickly by chemical reaction to reverse the neuromuscular blockade. We believe that the NMBAs can reduce the time required for induction of anesthesia and the reversal agent can reduce the time needed to recover from NMBA dosing post-procedure, while potentially enhancing patient safety and resulting in cost savings for the hospital or other provider. BX1000, the intermediate-acting NMBA, and the reversal agent were subject to a clinical hold imposed by the FDA due to need for additional toxicity data at higher dose exposures. We have met with the FDA and the clinical hold has been lifted with respect to BX1000. We continue to work with the FDA regarding a path forward for the reversal agent. We submitted a new IND for BX1000 in 2019.  
 We have a worldwide, exclusive license to the NMBAs and the related reversal agent from Cornell University.  
 We are conducting a Phase I study with BX1000 which began in 2020 to evaluate the safety profile when administered with Total Intravenous Anesthesia, as well as to evaluate the dose response of neuromuscular blockade. We filed an IND, or equivalent application, for BX2000 in order to conduct a First-in-Human study and are working on responding to the FDA review.
 Dex-IN
 Dex (dexmedetomidine) is a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that has demonstrated sedative, analgesic and anxiolytic properties. Dex has an extensive commercial history of safe injectable use. We have formulated Dex-IN, a proprietary intranasal formulation of Dex, at a significantly lower dose (approximately as low as 1/10th) than the currently recommended injectable dosage levels used for clinical sedation. Based upon our lower dose, we have seen minimal sedation to date in our clinical trials while still demonstrating an analgesic effect.
 We continue to explore possible uses of Dex-IN in other indications in the acute care space as well as pursue possible partnering opportunities. Once an indication is identified, clinical studies will be required to evaluate the safety of Dex-IN as well as the doses required to establish efficacy with respect to such indication.
 Intellectual Property
 We own patents and patent applications for injectable meloxicam, that cover pharmaceutical compositions, including compositions produced using NanoCrystal® technology, method of making injectable meloxicam and method of treating pain with injectable meloxicam. These issued patents expire between 2022 and 2030 in the United States, and the pending applications, if issued, would expire between 2024 and 2039. We also exclusively license from Alkermes, on a perpetual, royalty-free basis, composition and methods of making patents, and patent applications directed to the prevention of flake like aggregates to manufacture and commercialize IV, intramuscular or parenteral meloxicam, which begin to expire in 2030. 
 We license the patents and other intellectual property covering the NMBAs and the related reversal agent under a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license from Cornell. The issued patents and pending patent applications, if issued, expire between 2027 and 2033, subject to any applicable disclaimers or extension. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to pay Cornell (i) an annual license maintenance fee payment which ranges from $15,000 to $125,000 until the first commercial sale of a licensed compound; (ii) milestone payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, up to a maximum, for each NMBA, of $5 million for U.S. regulatory approval and commercialization milestones and $3 million for European regulatory approval and commercialization milestones; and (iii) royalties on net sales of the NMBAs and the related reversal agent at rates ranging from low to mid-single digits, depending on the applicable licensed compound and whether there is a valid patent claim in the applicable country, subject to an annual minimum royalty amount of $150,000 to $250,000 that increases to between $150,000 to $500,000 after the fourth year of sales. In addition, we will reimburse Cornell for past and ongoing patent costs related to prosecution and maintenance of the patents related to the licensed compounds. The license agreement is terminable by us at any time upon 90 days’ written notice and by Cornell upon our material breach, subject to a cure period, and upon our filing any claim asserting the invalidity of any of Cornell’s licensed patent rights. The royalty term for each licensed compound expires, on a country-by-country basis, on the later of (i) the expiration date of the longest-lived licensed patent, (ii) the expiration of any granted statutory period of marketing exclusivity, or (iii) the first commercial sale of a generic equivalent of the applicable licensed compound. On the last to expire royalty term the license agreement will automatically convert to a royalty-free nonexclusive license.

We own patents and patent applications directed to the analgesia indication, formulations and intranasal and transmucosal methods of use of Dex, in the United States and certain major foreign markets. Several patents have issued outside the United States for transmucosal methods, and the resulting patent protection will last into 2030, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. In addition, patents related to intranasal methods has issued in the United States and certain major foreign markets, and the resulting patent protection will last into 2032, subject to any disclaimers or extensions. 
 We are party to an exclusive license with Orion for the development and commercialization of Dex for use in the treatment of pain in humans in any dosage form for transdermal, transmucosal (including sublingual and intranasal), topical, enteral or pulmonary (inhalational) delivery, but specifically excluding delivery vehicles for administration by injection or infusion, worldwide, except for Europe, Turkey, and the CIS (currently includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan), referred to herein as the Territory. We have the right to sublicense the rights under such license at any time. We are required to pay Orion lump sum payments in an aggregate amount of €20.5 million on the achievement of certain developmental milestones and upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones, as well as a royalty on net sales during the term, which varies from 10% to 20% depending on annual sales levels. 
 We intend to rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality agreements and license agreements, to protect our product candidates. Our patent strategy is designed to facilitate commercialization of our current product candidates and future product candidates, as well as create barriers to entry for third parties. One focus of our claim strategy is on formulation claims and other related claims. 
 We are seeking patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. We also intend to rely on trade secrets to protect our product candidates. Our commercial success also depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. 
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to: 
  
• | obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our product candidates; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | defend our patents; 
• | develop trade secrets as needed and preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and 
• | operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.

 We have taken steps to build and will continue to build proprietary positions for our product candidates and related technology in the United States and abroad. We note that the patent laws of foreign countries differ from those in the United States, and the degree of protection afforded by foreign patents may be different from the protection offered by United States patents. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We believe the initial target audience for ANJESO and our product candidates will be specialty physicians, including surgeons, anesthesiologists and pain specialists. Our management team has experience building and launching therapeutics to specialty physicians, including hospital and related settings. As this target audience is only a portion of all physicians, we believe we have the capabilities to maintain and develop the sales and marketing infrastructure established and effectively market ANJESO and our product candidates. We are also seeking in-license or acquisition opportunities to add commercial or near-commercial products to our portfolio. We have established sales management, marketing and reimbursement functions for the commercialization of ANJESO in the United States and we believe we can utilize this infrastructure for the successful commercialization of an acquired or licensed product.
Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our current and future competitors include pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able to obtain and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. 
 Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than our product candidates or any other products that we may develop which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive. 
 12


We expect any products that we develop and commercialize, either alone or through a strategic partnership, to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to identify appropriate collaborators or partners to help commercialize our product candidates in our target commercial markets. 
 In the post-operative pain relief setting, we believe patients are prescribed injectable acetaminophen, NSAIDs, sodium channel blockers and opioids, depending on the severity of pain. Specifically, acetaminophen, NSAIDs and sodium channel blockers, we believe, are prescribed for mild to moderate pain relief, whereas we believe opioids are prescribed for moderate to severe pain relief. While we compete with all of these compounds in the post-operative pain setting, ANJESO is prescribed for moderate to severe pain, also competing with opioids and other non-opioid pain treatments. There are a number of pharmaceutical companies that currently market and or manufacture therapeutics in the pain relief area, including Johnson & Johnson, Mallinckrodt plc, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Trevena, Inc., and Innocoll Holdings plc. Mallinckrodt commercializes an injectable formulation of acetaminophen which is now available generically by many manufacturers, including Sandoz. Pacira commercializes an intraoperative formulation of bupivacaine, a sodium channel blocker, that is injected or instilled at the surgical site. Additionally, companies such as Adynxx, Inc., Durect Corporation, Heron Therapeutics, Inc., Sandoz AG, Avenue Therapeutics, Inc., Neumentum Inc. and Cara Therapeutics, Inc. are currently developing post-operative pain therapeutics that could compete with ANJESO in the future. 
 Manufacturing 
 We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce commercial supplies of ANJESO drug product as well as for our clinical studies with respect to our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, with oversight by our internal managers. We currently rely on a single manufacturer for commercial supply of ANJESO and for the clinical supplies of our drug product for each of our product candidates and do not currently have agreements in place for redundant supply or a second source for any of our product candidates. We have identified other potential drug product manufacturers that could satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, but this would require significant expense and could produce a significant delay in setting up the facility and moving equipment. Additionally, should a supplier or a manufacturer on whom we rely on to produce ANJESO or a product candidate provide us with a faulty product or a product that is later recalled, we would likely experience significant delays and additional costs. 
ANJESO 
 Alkermes is currently our exclusive supplier of bulk injectable meloxicam. Pursuant to a Development, Manufacturing and Supply Agreement, or Supply Agreement with our subsidiary, Baudax Bio Limited, Alkermes (through a subsidiary), provides clinical and commercial bulk supplies of injectable meloxicam formulation. During the term of the Supply Agreement, we will purchase our clinical and commercial supplies of bulk injectable meloxicam formulation exclusively from Alkermes. The Supply Agreement has an initial term expiring on March 31, 2030. The Supply Agreement will then automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless terminated by either party upon written notice at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term.
 Patheon provides sterile fill-finish of injectable meloxicam drug product pursuant to a Master Manufacturing Services Agreement and Product Agreement, collectively the Patheon Agreements, at its Monza, Italy manufacturing site. We have agreed to purchase a certain percentage of our annual requirements of finished injectable meloxicam from Patheon during the term of the Patheon Agreements. The Patheon Agreements expire on December 31, 2020 and will automatically renew thereafter for successive two-year periods unless terminated by either party upon prior written notice. The Patheon Agreement was renewed for a two-year term beginning on January 1, 2021.
 NMBAs 
 We have successfully sourced the manufacturing of the NMBAs and reversing agent at contract manufacturers for use in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials for these product candidates. 
 Dex-IN 
 We are party to an API supply agreement with Orion, whereby Orion provides us with API for the development and, if approved, commercialization of Dex-IN. Prior to obtaining regulatory approval, subject to advance notice to Orion, Orion will provide API without charge for agreed upon amounts. Any amounts ordered by us that are greater than the planned supply will be charged at 50% of the supply price for commercial product. The single unit dose intranasal sprayer for Dex-IN is manufactured by a supplier of proprietary components and devices. Suppliers of components, subassemblies and other materials are located in Europe, Asia and the United States. 
 Government Regulation 
 Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may legally be marketed in the United States. In addition, 
 13


to the extent we choose to clinically evaluate or market any products in other countries or develop these products for future licensing to third parties, we are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and to the authority of the competent regulatory authorities of those other countries. 
 U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative enforcement or judicial sanctions. This enforcement could include, without limitation, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, corrective actions, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, some of which must be conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s cGCPs to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
• | submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug; 
• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities identified in the NDA; 
• | review and approval of proposed proprietary name; and 
• | FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns regarding the product candidate or non-compliance with applicable requirements. 
 All clinical trials of a product candidate must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators, in accordance with cGCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, an IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution. The IRB’s role is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects involved in clinical studies by evaluating, among other things, the potential risks and benefits to subjects, processes for obtaining informed consent, monitoring of data to ensure subject safety, and provisions to protect the subjects’ privacy. The IRB approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. 
 Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol, and any amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the IND for FDA review and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. 
 14


Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase I. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Phase II. Phase II trials involve investigations in a limited patient population to identify possible AEs and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. 
• | Phase III. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling. 

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected side effects. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Results from earlier trials are not necessarily predictive of results from later trials. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product. 
 The submission of an NDA generally is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee for a human drug application. A waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, an applicant is eligible for waiver of the application fee if the applicant is a small business submitting its first human drug application and does not have another product approved under a human drug application and introduced and delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. However, we did not qualify due to prior NDA approvals received by Recro’s contract development and manufacturing, or CDMO, business. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new indication, dosage form, dosing regimen, route of administration, or active ingredient, must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may waive or defer pediatric studies under certain circumstances. 
 Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications. As an alternate path to FDA approval, particularly for modifications to drug products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and it permits approval of applications other than those for duplicate products and permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness of an approved drug product. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA requires submission of information needed to support any changes relative to a previously approved drug, known as the reference product, such as published data or new studies conducted by the applicant, including bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, or clinical trials demonstrating safety and effectiveness. The FDA may then approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for all or some of the labeled indications for which the reference product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the applicant, unless such indications or uses are protected by patent or exclusivity provisions covering the reference product. To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA’s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its application with respect to any patents for the reference product that are listed in the FDA’s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly referred to as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that, in relevant part, (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is 
 15


not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge one or more listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 Further, the FDA will also not approve a Section 505(b)(2) NDA until any non-patent exclusivity, such as, for example, five-year exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, three-year exclusivity for an approval based on new clinical trials, or pediatric exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the reference product, has expired. 
 If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the reference product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months, beginning on the date the patent holder receives notice, or until the patent expires or a court deems the patent unenforceable, invalid or not infringed, whichever is earlier. Even if a patent infringement claim is not brought within the 45-day period, a patent infringement claim may be brought under traditional patent law, but it does not invoke the 30-month stay. Moreover, in cases where a Section 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted after the fourth year of a previously approved drug’s five-year exclusivity period, and the patent holder brings suit within 45 days of notice of certification, the 30-month period is automatically extended to prevent approval of the Section 505(b)(2) application until the date that is seven and one-half years after approval of the previously approved reference product. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen either the 30-month or the seven and one-half year period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the NDA applicant or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45-day period, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) application at any time, assuming the application is otherwise approvable. 
 Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA’s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit. 
 FDA Review of New Drug Applications. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. If the FDA does not find an NDA to be sufficiently complete for filing, it may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. In this event, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether clinical data demonstrates that a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing process can assure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. 
  The approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a CRL if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form. The CRL usually describes all the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the CRL may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, and the agency also may require a REMS if it determines that a REMS is necessary to assure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. In addition, the FDA may require Phase IV testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specific circumstances of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Subject to certain limitations, the patent term restoration period is generally equal to one-half of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. However, each phase of the regulatory review period may be reduced by any time that the FDA finds the applicant did act not act with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, it must be the first approval of the active ingredient of the product, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within sixty days of approval of the drug. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for patents that issue from some of our currently owned or licensed patents or patent applications to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials, the eligibility of the product and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to NDAs for products containing chemical entities never previously approved by the FDA alone or in combination. A new chemical entity means a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any application submitted under Section 505(b) of the FDCA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. This exclusivity provision does not prevent the submission or approval of another full Section 505(b)(1) NDA, but such an NDA applicant would be required to conduct its own preclinical and adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, Section 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Such clinical trials may, for example, support new indications, dosages, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use. This exclusivity, which is sometimes referred to as clinical investigation exclusivity, prevents the FDA from approving an application under a Section 505(b)(2) NDA or an ANDA for the same conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations before the expiration of three years from the date of approval. Such three-year exclusivity, however, would not prevent the approval of another application if the applicant submits a Section 505(b)(1) NDA and has conducted its own adequate, well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy, nor would it prevent approval of an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA product that did not incorporate the exclusivity-protected aspects of the approved drug product. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months of exclusivity to any existing exclusivity (e.g., three- or five-year exclusivity) or patent protection for a drug. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity or patent protection, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. 
 Orange Book Listing
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or an application covered by Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients, generally in the same strengths and dosage form, as the listed drug and has been shown through pharmacokinetic, or PK, testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Section 505(b)(2) applications provide for marketing of a drug product that may have the same active ingredients as the listed drug and contains full safety and effectiveness data as an NDA, but at least some of this information comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant. This alternate regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
 The ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; 
 17


or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding a patented method of use rather than certify to such listed method of use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents by filing a certification that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product, the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, and a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) applicant. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation.
 The ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any drugs for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. 
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other government agencies enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the false or misleading promotion of drugs. The FDA also limits the promotion of product candidates prior to their approval. With limited exceptions, pre-approval promotion is prohibited under the FDA’s regulations. 
 Further, manufacturers of drugs must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process may require prior FDA approval before being implemented, and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs are required to list their products and to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct. 
 The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, untitled and warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, became law. The Cures Act contains numerous provisions, including provisions designed to speed development of innovative therapies and encourage greater use of real-world evidence to support regulatory decision making for drugs. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to clinically evaluate or sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable 
 18


regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing or distribution, would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States. 
 For example, in the European Union, we may submit applications for marketing authorizations either under a centralized, decentralized, or mutual recognition marketing authorization procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization for a medicinal product by the European Commission on the basis of a positive opinion by the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA. A centralized marketing authorization is valid for all European Union member states and three of the four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) States (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure apply between European Union member states. The decentralized marketing authorization procedure involves the submission of an application for marketing authorization to the competent authority of all European Union member states in which the product is to be marketed. One national competent authority, selected by the applicant, assesses the application for marketing authorization. The competent authorities of the other European Union member states are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territory on the basis of this assessment, except where grounds of potential serious risk to public health require this authorization to be refused. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of marketing authorizations delivered by the national competent authorities of European Union member states by the competent authorities of other European Union member states. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of a European Union member state requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another European Union member state for the same medicinal product. 
 We are also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act, and other third country anti-corruption laws and regulations pertaining to our financial relationships with foreign government officials. The U.K. Bribery Act, which applies to any company incorporated or doing business in the UK, prohibits giving, offering, or promising bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official or private person, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent bribery amongst employees and other agents. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances. Liability in relation to breaches of the U.K. Bribery Act is strict. This means that it is not necessary to demonstrate elements of a corrupt state of mind. However, a defense of having in place adequate procedures designed to prevent bribery is available. 
 Formulary Approvals and Third-Party Payer Coverage and Reimbursement 
 In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our product candidates, depends in significant part on the availability of institutional formulary approvals and on adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including, in the United States. These payers include CMS, the federal program that runs the Medicare program, and monitors the Medicaid programs offered by each state, as well as national and regional commercial plans. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by CMS through local Medicare Administrative Contractors that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly, disabled and other individuals with certain conditions. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program. Each government or commercial plan has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product and how much it will pay for that procedure or product. Commercial plans often rely on the lead of the governmental payers in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable Medicare coverage and reimbursement is usually an essential component of successfully launching a new product. The competitive position of some of our products will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and for the procedures in which such products are used. Reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by government and other commercial plans. 
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government healthcare programs and other third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payers are challenging the prices charged for medical products and requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices. 
 Payers also are increasingly changing the metrics for reimbursement rates, such as basing payment on average sales price, or ASP, AMP, and wholesale acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. CMS surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. It may be difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payers to cover any products for which we receive regulatory approval. 
 19


If we successfully commercialize any of our products, we may participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Participation is required for federal funds to be available for our products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we would be required to pay a quarterly rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Part B of the Medicare program. 
 Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. 
 Additionally, in order to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, a manufacturer also must participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program, established by Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA. Under this program, the manufacturer is obligated to make its innovator and single source products available for procurement on an FSS contract and charge a price to four federal agencies, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, or DoD, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard, that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price. Moreover, pursuant to regulations issued by the DoD’s TRICARE Management Activity, now the Defense Health Agency, to implement Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, manufacturers are required to provide rebates on utilization of their innovator and single source products that are dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies. The formula for determining the rebate is established in the regulations and is based on the difference between the annual non-federal average manufacturer price and the Federal Ceiling Price (these price points are required to be calculated by us under the VHCA). The requirements under the 340B, FSS, and TRICARE programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future. 
 There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers costs, including research, development, manufacturing, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used. Product reimbursement may also be incorporated into existing bundled payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or commercial payers and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Limited coverage may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which marketing approval is obtained. Third-party payers also may seek additional clinical evidence, including expensive pharmacoeconomic studies, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations, before covering our products for those patients. If reimbursement is available only for limited indications, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and commercial payers for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. Moreover, the requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, in the European Union the sole legal instrument at the European Union level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC, or the Price Transparency Directive. The aim of the Price Transparency Directive is to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in European Union member states are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement and trade of medicinal products in the European Union and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Price Transparency Directive does not, however, provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual European Union member states. Neither does it have any direct consequence for pricing or levels of reimbursement in individual European Union member states. The national authorities of the individual European Union member states are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement of medicinal products for human use. Some individual European Union member states adopt policies according to which a specific price or level of reimbursement is approved for the medicinal product. Other European Union member states adopt a system of reference pricing, basing the price or reimbursement level in their territory either, on the pricing and reimbursement levels in other countries, or on the pricing and reimbursement levels of medicinal products intended for the same therapeutic indication. Furthermore, some European Union member states impose direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. 
 Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some European Union member states. These countries include the United Kingdom, France, Germany and 
 20


Sweden. The HTA process in the European Union member states is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of the use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the national healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. 
 The outcome of HTA may influence the pricing and reimbursement status for specific medicinal products within individual European Union member states. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of a specific medicinal product vary between the European Union member states. 
 In 2011, Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted at European Union level. This Directive concerns the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare. The Directive is intended to establish rules for facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare in the European Union. Pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual European Union member states was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This could lead to harmonization between European Union member states of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTA in pricing and reimbursement decisions and negatively impact price in at least some European Union member states. 
 United States Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. 
 In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of AMP, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. Since that time, there have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. 
 On January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to exercise existing authorities to reduce burdens associated with the Affordable Care Act pending further action by Congress. In October 2017, he signed an Executive Order which directed federal agencies to modify how the Affordable Care Act is implemented. The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, the 2% Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act 
 21


was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Further legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, although the new Administration under President-elect Joseph Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it.   President-elect Biden indicated that he may use executive orders to undo changes to the Affordable Care Act made by the Trump administration and would advocate for legislation to build on the Affordable Care Act.  It is unknown what form any such changes or any law proposed to replace the Affordable Care Act would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.
 The Affordable Care Act has also been subject to challenges in the courts.  On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress.  On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court which heard oral arguments in the case on November 10, 2020.  A ruling is expected in 2021.
 The Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Furthermore, the law requires manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the “donut hole.” The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” by increasing from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D.
 The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. As noted above, the 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The Affordable Care Act expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act. Because the 340B ceiling price is determined based on AMP and Medicaid drug rebate data, revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition could cause the required 340B discounts to increase. 
 Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives as well. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed, and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
 At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 We expect that additional foreign, federal and state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 For ANJESO and if we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our activities are subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil False Claims Act, and laws and regulations pertaining to limitations on and reporting of healthcare provider payments (physician sunshine laws). These laws and regulations are interpreted and enforced by various federal, state and local authorities including CMS, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. These laws include:
 

22



 
• | the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | the U.S. civil False Claims Act (which can be enforced through “qui tam,” or whistleblower actions, by private citizens on behalf of the federal government), prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government; 
• | U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services by a healthcare benefit program, which includes both government and privately funded benefits programs; similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
• | state laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and
• | the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments made in the preceding calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 

 Violations of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, may subject us to significant civil, criminal and administrative sanctions including penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and/or adverse publicity. 
 Moreover, government entities and private litigants have asserted claims under state consumer protection statutes against pharmaceutical and medical device companies for alleged false or misleading statements in connection with the marketing, promotion and/or sale of pharmaceutical and medical device products, including state investigations and litigation by certain government entities regarding the marketing of opioid products.
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our industry is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently, the SEC and Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. Violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing 
 23


down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.
