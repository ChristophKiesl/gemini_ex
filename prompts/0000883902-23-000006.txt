Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Cornerstone Building Brands, Inc. (“Cornerstone Building Brands”, together with its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise, the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a holding company incorporated in Delaware. We are the largest manufacturer of exterior building products in North America by sales and serve residential and commercial customers across both the new construction and repair and remodel markets. 
Our operations are organized as three reportable segments: Aperture Solutions (formerly “Windows”), Surface Solutions (formerly “Siding”) and Shelter Solutions (formerly “Commercial”). We have:
•One of the broadest product offerings and the most well-regarded brand portfolio in our industry. Our total addressable market is diverse and expands across multiple geographies, end markets, channels, customers and products providing us with significant benefits.
•A leading market position in various North American markets we serve, including, among others, vinyl windows, vinyl siding, stone veneer installations, metal accessories, metal roofing and wall systems and engineered metal building systems.
•An extensive coast-to-coast network of manufacturing, distribution and branch office facilities throughout North America.
•A vertically integrated manufacturing process that enables us to deliver better service and positions us to be a cost-advantaged manufacturer.
We are mindful of the harmful effects of global climate change and the contributions to climate change from manufacturing operations and the end-use of building construction products. We have made and continue to make progress on our work related to ESG matters. 
Merger Transaction
On July 25, 2022 and pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 5, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, Camelot Return Intermediate Holdings, LLC (“Camelot Parent”), and Camelot Return Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), investment funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier and Rice, LLC (“CD&R”) became the indirect owners of all the issued and outstanding shares of Cornerstone Building Brands. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a subsidiary of Camelot Parent (the “Surviving Corporation”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), we became a privately held company and our common shares are no longer traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
At the Effective Time, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, each share of Company common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (other than (i) shares of Company common stock that were cancelled or converted into shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the Merger Agreement and (ii) shares of Company common stock held by stockholders of the Company (other than CD&R, certain investment funds managed by CD&R and other affiliates of CD&R that held shares of Company common stock) who did not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement or the Merger and who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware), was converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $24.65 in cash per share, without interest and subject to any required withholding taxes.
Our Strategy
We have developed and continue to implement a well-defined business strategy focused on four key elements.
Profitable Growth. The Company intends to expand into new and existing markets by leveraging our customer relationships and full portfolio of leading products. We believe that our customers look to us for quality products, dependable service and the national footprint required for large homebuilders and retail customers. We participate in the large exterior building products industry and have established leading market positions in many of our core product categories. Given our broad market participation, our growth strategy is differentiated by being focused and targeted on market segments exhibiting favorable characteristics, industry positioning and growth outlook. 
TABLE OF CONTENTS

We believe we have a meaningful opportunity for organic growth through product line extension, improvement of service quality, technology enhancement and new product development with innovation being a key pillar of our organic growth strategy. We also believe we have an opportunity to drive cross-selling of our products to deepen penetration, drive growth and maximize profitability across customer channels.
Using a highly collaborative selling approach, we intend to grow in attractive, highly fragmented market sectors that demand superior service and value the reliability and energy efficiency offered by our products. 
Operational Excellence. Our teams operate with a relentless drive for exceptional results and a passion for superior execution. The Cornerstone Production System (“CPS”) drives how we improve execution to deliver margin expansion across our business. We embrace a continuous improvement culture that is charged with increasing productivity; optimizing costs; and eliminating waste while encouraging organizational agility to fuel growth and establish Cornerstone Building Brands as a “supplier of choice” for our customers. This requires an ongoing commitment to attract, retain and develop the best talent; a paramount focus on the safety of our employees; and a commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion and the environment. This is particularly evident during periods of high risk, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to make investments in automation while maximizing quality within our manufacturing facilities, transforming the way work gets done and deploying capital in ways we believe will drive the greatest returns over the long-term.
The relentless focus on superior execution and our culture of continuous improvement create and protect our position as a cost-advantaged manufacturer with a highly variable and flexible cost structure and continue to favorably impact our financial results. 
Disciplined Capital Allocation. We are intently focused on adhering to a disciplined capital allocation framework, which includes: (i) investing in our core business through capital expenditures and other organic growth initiatives and (ii) pursuing strategic acquisitions to broaden our portfolio and capabilities across the residential and commercial markets, with a focus on adjacent exterior building products and related services. As part of this framework, we may also restructure, reposition or divest non-core product lines or assets.
We focus our core business investments on high-return initiatives in large markets to build scale and drive efficiency and investments in growing markets that leverage operational and distribution channel capabilities. 
Acquisitions and Divestitures. We regularly evaluate growth opportunities both through acquisitions and divestitures. 
We have a history of making strategic acquisitions that meet strict criteria. We frequently engage in negotiations with potential sellers regarding the possible purchase of businesses or assets that are strategic and complementary to our existing operations. Such negotiations may include participation in public auctions involving a number of potential buyers or situations where we are the only party or one of a very limited number of potential buyers.
We also evaluate possible dispositions of assets or businesses when such investments are no longer core to our operations and do not fit into our long-term strategy.
Reportable Segments
We have three reportable segments: Aperture Solutions, Surface Solutions and Shelter Solutions. Our reportable segments compete based on innovation, aesthetics, quality, price, service and responsiveness to distributor, retailer and installer needs, as well as end-user customer preference. Our markets are very competitive. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our top 10 customers accounted for 36% of net sales, with one customer accounting for 12% of our net sales. See Note 16 — Reportable Segment and Geographical Information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our reportable segments.

We sell our windows and doors through multiple distribution channels. Our residential new construction product lines are sold across a diversified customer base, which includes independent building products dealers; regional and national lumberyards; and homebuilders. Our residential repair and remodel window products are primarily sold through one-step distributors; retail home centers; and independent home improvement dealers. Dealers typically market directly to homeowners or contractors in connection with remodeling requirements, while distributors focus primarily on selling to local independent retailers. We are a key supplier to the nation’s largest homebuilders, which we have served through our distribution channels and through direct relationships for over 10 years.
In Canada, sales for residential new construction are predominantly made on a direct basis to homebuilders and contractors, while residential repair and remodel construction products are primarily sold not only through high-end independent dealers and regional lumberyards, but also directly to contractors and consumers through our supply-and-install services. We distribute Ply Gem Canada products through our distribution centers across Western Canada. In Ontario, we manufacture and distribute North Star branded windows primarily for the premium-priced tier of the residential repair and remodel market.
The North American window and patio door market remains highly fragmented. The Aperture Solutions reportable segment’s main competitors include national brands such as Jeld-Wen, Pella, MI and Andersen, and regional brands such as Weather Shield. Competitors in Canada include Jeld-Wen, All Weather Windows, Durabuilt and numerous regional brands. We generally compete on service, product performance and breadth of product offerings. We believe all of our products are competitively priced and that we are one of the few manufacturers to serve all end markets and price points on a national basis.
Surface Solutions
Our Surface Solutions reportable segment offers a broad suite of surface solution products and accessories at multiple price tiers for the residential new construction and repair and remodel end markets as well as stone installation services.

Shelter Solutions
Our Shelter Solutions reportable segment designs, engineers, manufactures and distributes an extensive line of building products for the low-rise commercial construction market under multiple brand names and through a nationwide network of manufacturing plants and distribution centers. 
We believe we maintain leading positions across all of our key product categories in this reportable segment and we believe that our brands, many of which have been in use for several decades, are well-recognized by our customers and industry associations. Our principal products in this reportable segment include:
Metal Building Systems – Metal building systems consist of engineered structural members and panels that are fabricated and roll-formed in a factory. These systems are custom designed and engineered to meet project requirements and then shipped to a construction site complete and ready for assembly with no additional field welding required. Engineered building systems manufacturers design an integrated system that meets applicable building code and designated end use requirements. These systems consist of primary structural framing, secondary structural members (purlins and girts) and metal roof and wall systems or conventional wall materials manufactured by others, such as masonry and concrete tilt-up panels.
Our metal building systems are sold predominately under the Metallic Building Company®, Ceco Building Systems, Star Building Systems®, Heritage Building Systems®, and Robertson Building Systems® brands.
Metal Roofing and Wall Systems – These products are used in new construction and in repair and retrofit applications for industrial, commercial, institutional, agricultural, rural and residential uses. Metal components are used in a wide variety of construction applications, including purlins and girts, roofing, standing seam roofing, walls, doors, trim and other parts of traditional buildings, as well as in architectural applications and engineered building systems. 
Our metal roofing and wall systems are sold predominantly under key brands including the Union Corrugating Company®, Reed’s Metals® and Metal Depots® brands. Our metal components are sold predominately under key brands including MBCI® and ABC American Building Components® brands .
Our products offer a number of advantages over traditional construction alternatives, including shorter construction time, more efficient use of materials, lower construction costs, greater ease of expansion and lower maintenance costs. We sell our products for both new construction and repair and remodel applications across a broad range of markets and customer solutions, including distribution and warehouse facilities; manufacturing and industrial facilities; as well as automotive, aviation, agricultural, healthcare, educational and retail facilities, among others.
We compete with a number of other manufacturers of metal components and engineered building systems for the building industry, which mainly include Nucor, BlueScope, McElroy, Metal Sales and Central States. Many of these competitors operate on a regional basis. We have two primary nationwide competitors in the engineered building systems market and three primary nationwide competitors in the metal components market. The metal components market is more fragmented than the engineered building systems market.
Other Information
Manufacturing and Distribution
We employ a multichannel distribution strategy with 165 manufacturing and warehouse facilities across North America. Our broad distribution network enables us to serve customers across all 50 U.S. states, all 10 Canadian provinces and other select international jurisdictions. Our integrated footprint enhances our ability to serve and develop deeper customer relationships across both our residential and commercial end markets. The breadth of diversification across our business, from what we sell, to where we sell and to whom we sell, enables significant resiliency in our business model by insulating us from any negative trends or fluctuations in any single market segment, distribution channel, customer segment or product category.
Seasonality
Our sales volume is generally higher during our second and third quarters, which is historically the peak season for construction and remodeling in North America. Seasonal variations in our operational results may be negatively impacted by inclement weather and other conditions. Working capital requirements have generally been greatest during the first half of our fiscal year due to the timing of the buildup of inventory to support the heavier construction season. In our Shelter Solutions reportable segment, low-rise building application construction typically lags housing cycles by 12 to 24 months.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Raw Materials
We mainly use PVC resin, aluminum and glass in our residential products and steel in our commercial products. The availability, quality and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated, and will continue to fluctuate over time. Raw materials are mainly sourced from North America, generally available from numerous sources and the number of suppliers is adequate to support production. We have typically been able to pass commodity price increases to our customers.
Intellectual Property
Product innovation and branding are important to the success of our business. In addition to the brand protection offered by our trademarks, patent protection helps distinguish our unique product features in the market by preventing copying and making it more difficult for competitors to benefit unfairly from our design innovation. We hold U.S. and foreign patents covering various features used in products sold within all of our reportable segments. Although each of our reportable segments relies on a number of trademarks, patents and patent groups that, in the aggregate, provide important protections to the Company, no single trademark, patent or patent group is material to any of the Company’s reportable segments. We vigorously protect our intellectual property rights.
Human Capital Resources
At December 31, 2022, we employed more than 19,500 full-time and part-time employees (excluding contract workers). Approximately 77% of our workforce is composed of hourly production and distribution employees. Approximately 2,300 of employees work under collective bargaining agreements. Our current agreements expire in fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025.
Corporate stewardship is a responsibility that is deeply embedded in our long brand history. We believe our employees drive our business and our ability to effectively serve our customers and sustain our competitive position. We endeavor to create an environment that keeps our employees safe, treats them with dignity and respect and fosters a culture of performance. We do this through the programs summarized below, the objective and related risk of each is overseen by our Board of Directors or its committees.
Leadership, Talent Acquisition and Talent Management
Our talent strategy is rooted in our Success Model, which is built upon our core values of safety, integrity, innovation and teamwork. 
Our talent philosophy dictates the way we manage our talent processes to ensure transparent, fair, inclusive, and differentiated treatment for all employees and candidates. We measure performance based upon both results achieved and the way in which results are achieved. Our Success Model reinforces the culture that we want to have at Cornerstone Building Brands. It highlights four key leadership elements and associated behaviors our employees must demonstrate to help us effectively lead at every level. The four elements are: Lead Inclusively, Drive Change, Win as One, and Make an Impact. Success Model behaviors, along with goal achievement, comprise a performance rating that is used in our pay for performance and talent review processes. 
Our leaders receive training on our three pillars of performance management, succession and talent planning, and learning and talent development. This creates the foundation for our leaders to support their teams to connect their work to our purpose, mission, values, and strategies of the Company, motivating and giving them a higher sense of purpose.
Our talent strategy is focused on having the right people in the right roles supporting a consistent and compelling employee experience. This ensures that we are able to exceed our customers’ expectations and allow our people to develop and increase their career opportunities. Our talent management process:
•Clearly defines roles and goals;
•Establishes clear-cut performance and behavior expectations;
•Focuses work in alignment with business strategy and company goals; and
•Creates consistent, structured processes to enable development and career growth, including extensive curriculum and training programs.
Core to our talent management strategy is embracing all candidates, no matter their background, race, age or sexual orientation and identity, and delivering a transparent, fair and engaging experience across the organization. We recruit, hire and train candidates using a process that is free from biases for or against any individual or group of candidates. Using technology and grass roots recruiting, we specifically target sources where candidates congregate, and we go to market with an employer brand that highlights the value we place on people and opinions from all walks of life.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Competitive Pay and Benefits
To attract and retain the best employees, we focus on providing competitive pay and benefits. Our programs target the market for competitiveness. We provide benefit programs with the goal of improving physical, mental and financial wellness of our employees throughout their lifetime. Some examples include base and variable pay, medical, dental, vision, life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, paid time off and retirement savings plans.
When designing our base pay compensation ranges, we perform market analyses to ensure ranges are current and our employees are advancing their earning potential. We also perform frequent compensation studies to assess market movement and competitive changes in local marketplaces. We continually review wages in all countries we operate to ensure we are fair, equitable, competitive and can attract and retain the best talent.
We also support diverse benefit programs that are aligned with our values and focused on supporting employees and their families based on their unique needs. For example, our Employee Assistance Foundation assists employees in need of emergency financial support and is offered to all employees. We also offer a broad range of benefits to support our employees wanting to expand their families through adoption benefits, infertility treatment benefits, and paid time off to bond with their new families.
Employee Safety and Wellness
Cornerstone Building Brands is committed to safety as our highest priority. Safety is one of the Company’s core values and nothing is more important to us than providing a safe work environment. We are committed to (i) providing training for our employees to perform their job tasks safely, (ii) developing and maintaining safety programs and initiatives with the purpose of eliminating all injuries, safety incidents and job-related illnesses and (iii) addressing all safety risks in a thorough and timely manner. We publicly disclose operational health and safety statistics on our rate of recordable injuries and our rate of lost workdays due to injury involving full-time and part-time employees, temporary employees and contractors.
Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic illustrated our commitment to safety. To support our employees, customers and communities, we took extraordinary measures and invested in practices to protect employees and reduce the risk of spreading the virus. Our actions included additional cleaning of our facilities, staggering crews, incorporating visual cues to reinforce social distancing, providing face coverings and gloves, as well as implementing daily health validation at our manufacturing and office facilities.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Our Company’s Purpose is to positively contribute to the communities where we live, work, and play. It begins with our employees, a team comprised of many backgrounds, each adding a unique and valued contribution to the success of our organization. Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”) promise supports our purpose, mission and core values to have a work environment that is inclusive and equitable for all employees. This creates an environment of mutual respect where our diversity reflects the communities we serve.
Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council (the “Council”) began with 12 key leaders who were selected based on capability, sphere of influence, interests and their passion for creating an inclusive culture. In 2021, we added the chairs of each Employee Resource Group to the Council, bringing our total Council to 20 members. The Council has a charter and an ongoing prioritized action plan to accelerate the adoption of DE&I in our processes to positively impact our culture. The Council’s responsibilities include defining metrics, setting targets, benchmarking, providing education and training, seeking employee feedback and building engagement as well as evaluating the Company’s current initiatives within the DE&I context.
The Employee Resource Groups include members and allies of Women!, Unity, Pride and Patriots. Each group has a core active group who meet monthly, while the entire Employee Resource Group meets together once per quarter to drive and support our purpose, mission and core values to have a workplace environment that is inclusive and equitable for all employees.

Environmental Matters
Sustainability
We are well positioned to make positive impacts on the communities we serve as we continue our journey to become North America’s premier manufacturer of exterior building solutions. To do so, we consider how we can increase manufacturing efficiencies, reduce environmental impacts, take care of our people, and uphold professional integrity and ethics in everything we do.
We recognize our responsibility as a provider of building solutions to communities across North America to incorporate sustainability into our products and business operations. Our business was formed by brands that have been making sustainability-focused decisions for several years, and now we are building on that foundation to challenge ourselves to do more. In 2022, we continued our sustainability journey by establishing baselines for key ESG metrics, implementing a SaaS application to operationalize our ESG data and engaging our supply chain with respect to ESG-specific initiatives. As we continue to develop an integrated strategy of financial growth and corporate responsibility for the future, we acknowledge that there is still much work to do as we take the next steps on our sustainability journey. 
We believe that we can use our footprint for good and act as stewards of the environment. By addressing energy usage and operational environmental impacts, we seek to have a positive impact for both our stakeholders and the planet. We are committed to the well-being of our employees and the communities and customers we serve. We believe that our sustainable business practices provide positive social benefits to our people. Our highest priority is always the safety of our employees. We feel a responsibility not only to uphold product integrity and safety, but also to leverage innovation and stewardship to make products that meet the needs of our customers and promote sustainability. We are committed to conducting business at the highest levels of ethics every day.
Environment, Health and Safety Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws. Among other things, these laws regulate the emissions or discharge of materials into the environment; govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes; protect the health and safety of our employees and the end-users of our products; regulate the materials used in our products; and impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating (as well as other damages resulting from) present and past releases of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws or of any conditions contained in environmental permits could result in substantial fines or penalties, injunctive relief, consent orders, requirements to install pollution controls or other abatement equipment, or civil sanctions.
We could be held liable for costs to investigate, remediate, or otherwise address contamination at any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site, or at other sites where we or predecessors may have released hazardous materials. We could incur fines, penalties or sanctions or be subject to third-party claims, including indemnification claims, for property damage, personal injury or otherwise as a result of violations of (or liabilities under) environmental, health and safety laws, or in connection with releases of hazardous or other materials.
Changes in or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or other environmental liabilities or obligations with respect to our products or business activities, or the imposition of new regulatory requirements for our facilities may lead to additional costs that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We do not believe that compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, including existing requirements to investigate and remediate contamination, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, or manufacturing processes.
The following are representative environmental, health and safety requirements relating to our operations:
Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state and foreign laws. These laws govern emissions of air pollutants from industrial stationary sources, such as our manufacturing facilities, and impose various permitting, air pollution control, emissions monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Such laws may require us to obtain pre-approval for constructing or modifying our facilities in ways that have the potential to produce new or increased air emissions; obtain and comply with operating permits that limit air emissions or certain operating parameters, or employ best available control technologies to reduce or minimize emissions from our facilities. We may be required to purchase air pollution control equipment to comply with air emissions laws.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

Greenhouse Gases. Efforts to mitigate the effects of global climate change has led to federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. While GHG regulations generally do not affect our facilities as they are insignificant sources, more stringent federal, regional, state, and foreign laws and regulations relating to global climate change and GHG emissions may be adopted. These laws and regulations could impact our facilities, raw material suppliers, the transportation and distribution of our products, and our customers’ businesses, which could reduce demand for our products or cause us to incur additional capital, operating or other costs. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future legislation or regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our business. In addition, global climate change may increase the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events, such as storms, floods, extreme temperatures and other events that could affect our facilities, our supply chain, raw material suppliers, the transportation and distribution of our products, and demand for our products.
Hazardous and Solid Industrial Waste. Our operations generate industrial solid wastes, including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state and foreign laws. RCRA imposes requirements for the handling, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste. Industrial wastes that we generate in our manufacturing processes, such as used chemicals, may be regulated as hazardous waste, although RCRA has provisions to exempt some of our wastes from this category. However, our non-hazardous and exempted industrial wastes are still regulated under state law or the less stringent industrial solid waste requirements of RCRA. 
RCRA Corrective Action Program. Certain facilities may be subject to the Corrective Action Program under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by RCRA, and the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (“Corrective Action Program”). The Corrective Action Program is designed to ensure that certain facilities subject to RCRA have investigated and remediated releases of hazardous substances at their property.
CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”, commonly known as Superfund), and comparable state and foreign laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. These include the current and past owners or operators of sites where hazardous substances were released, and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at off-site locations such as landfills. CERCLA authorizes the EPA and, in certain cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health and welfare or the environment and to seek to recover remediation costs from the responsible parties. 
We currently own or lease, and historically owned or leased, numerous properties that have extensive histories of industrial operations. Hazardous substances may have been released on, under or from these properties, or on, under or from other locations where hazardous wastes have been disposed. Some of these properties have been owned or operated by third parties who may have released hazardous substances for which we could have liability. We could be required to investigate or remediate contaminated property, perform remedial closure activities, or assess and remediate volatile chemical vapors migrating from soil or groundwater into overlying buildings. Our liability for investigating and remediating contamination could be joint and several and could include damages for impacts to natural resources.
Wastewater Discharges. Our operations are subject to the federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and comparable state and foreign laws. These laws impose requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants from industrial activity into waters of the United States. Such laws may require that we comply with stormwater runoff and wastewater discharge standards or obtain permits limiting our discharges of pollutants. Failure to comply with CWA requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, restrictions on operations, and administrative or civil enforcement actions. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for wastewater discharge or stormwater runoff treatment technology to comply with wastewater permits and water quality standards. 
Employee Health and Safety. We are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state and foreign laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our workers. Among other things, we are required to maintain and make available to our employees, state and local government authorities, and others information about hazardous materials used or produced by our operations.
