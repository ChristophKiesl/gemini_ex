Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 Intevac’s business consists of two reportable segments: 
 Thin-film Equipment (“TFE”): Intevac is a leader in the design and development of high-productivity, thin-film processing systems. Our production-proven platforms are designed for high-volume manufacturing of substrates with precise thin-film properties, such as the hard disk drive (“HDD”) media, display cover panel (“DCP”), and solar photovoltaic (“PV”) markets we serve currently. 
 Photonics: Intevac is a leading developer of advanced high-sensitivity digital sensors, cameras and systems that primarily serve the defense industry. We are a leading provider of integrated digital night-vision imaging systems for the U.S. military. 
 Intevac was incorporated in California in October 1990 and was reincorporated in Delaware in 2007. 
 TFE Segment 
 Hard Disk Drive (“HDD”) Equipment Market 
 Intevac designs, manufactures, markets and services complex capital equipment used to deposit thin films and lubricants onto substrates to produce magnetic disks that are used in HDDs. Disk and disk drive manufacturers produce magnetic disks in a sophisticated manufacturing process involving many steps, including plating, annealing, polishing, texturing, sputtering, etching, stripping and lubrication. Intevac believes its systems represent approximately 65% of the installed capacity for disk sputtering worldwide. Intevac’s systems are used by manufacturers of magnetic media such as Seagate Technology, Western Digital and its wholly-owned subsidiary HGST, Fuji Electric and Showa Denko. 
 HDDs are a primary storage medium for digital data including nearline “cloud” applications and are used in products and applications such as personal computers (“PCs”), enterprise data storage, video players and video game consoles. Intevac believes that HDD media shipments will grow over time, driven by continued high growth rates in digitally-stored data, by the slowing of areal density improvements, by the increase in demand for nearline drives for cloud storage, an increasing tie ratio (the average number of disks per hard drive) and by new and emerging applications. The projected growth rates for digitally-stored data on HDDs exceed the rate of areal density improvements, at the same time as the tie ratio is increasing, which results in demand for magnetic disks outpacing HDD units.

  In recent years HDD media units have been negatively impacted by declining PC units, primarily resulting from the proliferation of tablets and the transition to centralized storage. Although the HDD industry continues to expect growth in the nearline data storage market segment, the transition to centralized storage combined with the negative growth in PC shipments has resulted in lower HDD shipments in recent years. However, Intevac continues to believe that long-term demand for hard disks required for high capacity HDDs will increase, driven by growth in demand for digital storage, a declining growth rate in areal density improvements, and increased information technology spending to support the transition to cloud storage. The number of disk manufacturing systems needed to support this growth as well as future technology transitions and improvements is expected to vary from year to year depending on the factors noted above. 
 Intevac expects that HDD manufacturers will extend their utilization of planar perpendicular media with the introduction of new technologies such as Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording (“HAMR”) and Energy Assisted Magnetic Recording (“EAMR”). Initial volume shipments of both HAMR and EAMR-based HDDs began in 2020. Intevac believes that leading manufacturers of magnetic media that are using Intevac systems for the development of these new technologies, will create a significant market opportunity for systems upgrades in support of the media evolution required by these new technologies as they are more widely adopted. 
 Display Cover Panel (“DCP”) Market 
 Intevac develops equipment to deposit optically transparent thin films onto DCPs typically found on consumer and automotive electronic products. 
 DCPs are found in products including smartphones, tablet PCs, wearable devices, gaming systems, digital cameras, automotive infotainment systems and digital signage. In 2020, approximately 1.55 billion smartphones, 150 million tablet PCs and 91 million smart watches were shipped to consumers worldwide. For smartphones alone, it is forecasted that nearly 1.7 billion units will ship by 2024, representing a CAGR of 2.3% for the 2020 – 2024 time period. 
 The DCP is typically made of tempered glass, such as soda-lime or aluminosilicate, or other materials such as sapphire, ceramic and colorless polyimide. The primary function of the DCP is to provide a clear protective interface to the display it protects. In many cases, the DCP is treated with various coatings to enhance its protective performance as well as for clarity, readability and touch sensitivity. 
 The types of coatings typically found on DCPs of electronic devices include: Scratch Protection (“SP”) coatings, Anti-Reflection (“AR”) coatings, Anti-Fingerprint (“AF”) and Non-Conductive Vacuum Metallization (“NCVM”) coatings. 
 SP coatings generally consist of hard thin films deposited onto the surface of the DCP. Their primary function is to provide enhanced protection against the incidence of scratch, but they can also provide greater breakage resistance. Intevac has developed and is currently marketing a SP coating known as Optical Diamond-like-Carbon (“oDLC®”) utilizing its production-proven carbon film technology that is also used on HDD media. This coating provides a hard protective layer which significantly improves the DCP’s resistance to scratches and breakage. The oDLC coating has demonstrated scratch protection benefits reflecting a greater than 20 times improvement over current standard cover glass under stainless steel ball Taber scratch testing. Furthermore, using a Ring-on-Ring (“RoR”) test, cover glass with our oDLC coating provides a greater than 20 percent increase in breakage resistance strength over cover glass without the oDLC coating. Intevac expects that the adoption of AR and NCVM coatings on mobile devices will create an increased need for SP coatings and provide a significant demand opportunity for oDLC. 
 In 2019, Intevac released DiamondClad® protective coating. DiamondClad is a proprietary multi-step process that improves upon our original single film solution, oDLC. Developed in-house utilizing the ion beam source technology released in 2018, DiamondClad now performs similarly to sapphire in scratch testing at the Mohs scale of material hardness 8 standard, compared to the industry standard glass with anti-fingerprint or AF coatings, which scratches at a Mohs 5 level. DiamondClad coating outperforms standard cover glass by a factor of 4 in Taber wear testing, and by a factor of 4 to 6 times in use-case AF durability testing with sand, denim, and perspiration. 
 AR coatings enable greater light transmission though the DCP by reducing the light reflected by the surface back to the user’s eye. This allows the user to more easily read the display and reduces the required power needed to display the image which results in extending the battery life. A significant drawback to using AR coatings is their susceptibility to scratch. AR coatings are typically soft and must be applied to the outer surface of the DCP. These coatings generally scratch easily, and as such, smartphone manufacturers have been reluctant to implement AR coatings on their products.

  AF coatings provide water and oil protection for the surface of the DCP. This coating, which prevents fingerprints, provides greater aesthetics as well as improving readability. AF coatings allow for greater visual acuity when fingerprints are not visible. The drawback to AF coatings is their relatively low resistance to wear. The coating is soft and usually wears off within a few months of product purchase. 
 With increasing adoption of wireless charging and the 5G standard of wireless communication, smartphone manufacturers are significantly expanding use of DCPs on the backside of devices. This transition is essential to ensure that the backside cover, which previously was metallic, does not interfere with the wireless signals. NCVM coatings are a new type of color film coating, applied for decorative purposes, to the backside DCP. When applied to the exterior, the NCVM coating provides a pleasing aesthetic and gives manufacturers flexibility with color customization. Decorative NCVM coatings have evolved from single color to multiple colors with complex transitions. Intevac has developed a proprietary technology that enables the creation of uniquely patterned NCVM coatings for the phone back cover. Several leading handset manufacturers are currently evaluating this technology for potential incorporation into their upcoming phone models. 
 When applied to the exterior of the backside DCP, NCVM has a tendency to scratch easily and rub off over time, leading to a poor appearance. To preserve the color film on the backside DCP, manufacturers are reliant on SP coatings for scratch-resistance and a consistent appearance. Intevac expects the adoption of AR and NCVM coatings on mobile devices will create an increased need for SP coatings and provide a significant demand opportunity for oDLC and DiamondClad coatings. 
 DIAMOND DOG® Screen Protectors 
 In fiscal 2020, Intevac launched DIAMOND DOG® screen protectors for mobile devices with DiamondClad® tempered glass, a consumer product. DIAMOND DOG provides long-lasting mobile device screen protection and performance. The DIAMOND DOG screen protector features the patented DiamondClad diamond-like carbon coating technology, which is designed to help protect phones and preserve their brand-new look. The screen protector is custom fit for iPhone and Samsung models. Lab tests show DIAMOND DOG screen protectors provide up to 6 times better scratch protection, up to 5 times more abrasion protection, up to 4-6 times longer anti-fingerprint protection, and up to 3 times better breakage protection. During fiscal 2020 sales of DIAMOND DOG screen protectors were not significant. 
 Solar Market 
 Intevac designs, manufactures and markets capital equipment for the PV solar manufacturing industry. 
 A solar cell (also called a PV cell) is a solid state device that converts the energy of sunlight directly into electricity. Assemblies of cells are used to make solar modules, also known as solar panels. Solar panels have broad-based end market applications for utility-scale solar farms; integrated building PV arrays for commercial, retail, and offices; residential rooftop; and for portable devices. 
 The cost of electricity generated from solar energy, in many cases, remains higher than that of electricity generated from traditional energy sources. However, deployment of photovoltaics is gaining momentum on a worldwide scale, particularly in Asia, North America and other regions, where solar PV is now increasingly competitive with conventional energy sources. Grid parity, whereby solar PV generates power at a levelized cost of electricity (“LCOE”) less than or equal to the price of power purchased from the electrical grid, has already been reached in about thirty countries. In countries or areas where the cost of solar energy generation remains higher than traditional electricity generation sources, some governments have implemented various tax credits and other financial incentives to promote the growth in solar and other alternative energy sources. As a result of solar energy costs having favorably declined due to the increased scale and improved manufacturing efficiencies spurred by these incentive policies, many governments have reduced or are planning to reduce their incentives for solar, a trend which is likely to continue. More than 120 gigawatts of solar capacity were added globally in 2020, rising 7.1% year-on-year, but the rate is expected to taper off to a modest growth of 4.1% in 2021. Intevac expects that 2021 will continue to be challenging for the solar industry due to further declines in solar panel pricing. 
 The PV industry continues to focus on the development of high-efficiency cell technologies aimed at simultaneously boosting PV efficiency and reducing solar energy production costs. New vacuum process technologies and integrated processing steps are expected to become increasingly important as companies search for lower-cost manufacturing solutions for PV cells. 
 Intevac offers products for wafer-based crystalline silicon (“c-Si”) solar cell manufacturing processes, the prevailing manufacturing process in the PV industry. Intevac’s products for the solar industry are specifically focused on cell designs with the highest energy conversion efficiency, which are within the n-type mono crystalline portion of the market.

  Intevac offers thin-film vacuum process manufacturing solutions for c-Si cell fabrication applications. Intevac offers high-productivity process equipment solutions that enable low-cost solar cell manufacturing with high cell efficiency, consistent with the PV industry’s focus and requirements. Intevac has developed two vacuum process application technologies for solar cell manufacturing: one utilizes Physical Vapor Deposition (“PVD”) technology for the deposition of thin films onto c-Si wafers, and the other utilizes ion implantation, which selectively changes the electrical characteristics of the c-Si solar cell. 
 PVD is a process used in multiple ways in the manufacturing of solar cells such as for fabricating electrical contacts and conductor layers, depositing reflective layers of various types, and for growing transparent conductive oxide layers, all of which are critical to the efficiency of solar cells. 
 Ion implantation is a solar cell processing technology whereby an impurity is added to a PV structure to improve its conductivity. In ion implantation, a beam of ions of a desired dopant element such as phosphorus or boron is electrostatically accelerated and directed toward the target material, introducing the impurity. In a subsequent thermal annealing step, the dopant is electrically activated. The ion implant processes enable precision engineering of the dose and of the depth of dopant elements to form emitter structures in working solar cells. Ion implantation is a technique being introduced to solar cell lines as a means to lower the cost per watt to manufacture the cell. Ion implantation can replace existing diffusion processes in existing solar processing lines for present-day PV cell structures, and is also extendable to new advanced cell structures. In both cases, ion implant-formed emitters are created with fewer processing steps, and therefore at lower cost, than the diffusion processes implant displaces. Intevac’s ion implantation products are based upon technology developed by Solar Implant Technologies, Inc. (“SIT”) which was acquired by Intevac in November 2010. 
 Fan-Out Packaging Market 
 Intevac is bringing to market capital equipment for fan-out packaging applications, fan-out packaging being a specialized part of the overall semiconductor device packaging market. 
 Semiconductor device packaging technology in general, and fan-out wafer level packaging (“FOWLP”)/fan-out panel level packaging (“FOPLP”) technology in particular, is being driven by the strong cost advantages these technologies offer over the cost of further implementing continued Moore’s Law progress for 10nm and 7nm semiconductor device process nodes. Generally speaking, fan-out packaging provides for increased Input/Output (“I/O”) density for a given semiconductor device while simultaneously supporting continued progress in shrinking the individual semiconductor devices, resulting in decreased footprint per device and, by extension, decreases in the amount of space integrated circuit content occupies in handheld consumer electronic products, for example in smartphones, wearables, and in Internet of Things (“IoT”) devices. 
 Fan-out packaging technology consists of a series of operations where known good semiconductor devices from silicon wafers fabricated by an Integrated Device Manufacturer (“IDM”), or by a semiconductor foundry, are singulated and then assembled onto a substrate or temporary carrier, which is then overmolded with epoxy mold compound and cured to create what is known as a reconstituted wafer. The reconstituted wafer then goes through another series of process steps (dielectric deposition, metallization, photolithography), to create a redistributed “fan-out” of the electrical interconnections from the original silicon device area to an expanded area that includes the device (die) surface itself, along with a generous amount of extra surface created from the mold compound area. 
 A redistribution layer (“RDL”) is the “fanned-out” metal layer on a packaged integrated circuit that makes the I/O pads of the integrated circuit available in other locations. PVD processes are essential to RDL fabrication; in fan-out packaging, our INTEVAC MATRIX®PVD system is used to deposit thin layers of Titanium (“Ti”), Titanium Tungsten (“TiW”) and Copper (“Cu”) to form the barrier/seed layer upon which the full RDL is constructed. 
 Applications driving the adoption of fan-out packaging include, among others: (1) baseband processors and application processors; (2) radio frequency (“RF”) transceivers and switches; (3) power management integrated circuits (“PMIC”); (4) radar modules for automotive; (5) audio codec; and (6) microcontrollers. 
 Smartphones from OEMs including Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, OPPO and others incorporate fan-out packaged components, as do most higher-end automobiles. IoT applications in the future are expected to contribute additional significant volume in fan-out packaged devices. 
 The compelling advantages our INTEVAC MATRIX PVD system brings to fan-out packaging are a much-reduced cost of ownership over the current PVD process tools of record used for RDL barrier/seed layer applications, and also the flexibility to

  run round wafers, and square or rectangular panels, with no changes to the INTEVAC MATRIX PVD system beyond a simple substrate carrier substitution.

  Competition 
 The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for Intevac TFE products include price, product performance and functionality, ease of integration, customer support and service, reputation and reliability. Intevac has one major competitor, Canon Anelva, in the hard disk drive equipment market and has historically experienced intense worldwide competition for magnetic disk sputtering equipment. Intevac primarily faces competition from large established global competitors in the PV equipment market including Centrotherm Photovoltaics, Jusung, Kingstone, Von Ardenne and Belight Technology. Intevac faces competition in the DCP market from optical coating equipment manufacturers such as Optorun, Shincron and Hongda, glass manufacturers that may develop scratch resistant glass, touchscreen manufacturers that may adopt harder substrate materials, or other equipment companies, chemical companies or the display cover plate manufacturers themselves that may offer competing protective coatings including DLC, NCVM and AR. Intevac’s competitors for PVD processes in the fan-out packaging market include the companies SPTS Technologies (a KLA company), Evatec AG, ULVAC Technologies, Inc., Tango Systems, Inc. (an Applied Materials company) and ASM NEXX, Inc. These competitors generally have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, manufacturing and other resources as compared to Intevac. Furthermore, any of Intevac’s competitors may develop enhancements to, or future generations of, competitive products that offer superior price or performance features. In addition, new competitors, with enhanced products may enter the markets that Intevac currently serves. 
 The principal competitive factors affecting Photonics products include price, extreme low-light level performance, power consumption, resolution, size, ease of integration, reliability, spectral band, reputation and customer support and service. Intevac faces substantial competition for Photonics products, and many competitors have substantially greater resources and brand recognition. In the military market for soldier and helicopter night vision goggles, Elbit Systems and L3Harris Technologies are large and well-established defense contractors and are the primary U.S. manufacturers of analog image intensifier tubes used in Generation-III night-vision devices. For long range airborne targeting applications, Intevac competes against camera providers using low light CMOS imagery. Intevac expects that other companies will develop digital night-vision products and aggressively promote their sales. 
Marketing and Sales 
 TFE sales are made primarily through Intevac’s direct sales force. Intevac also sells its products through distributors in Japan and China. The selling process for Intevac’s TFE products is multi-level and lengthy, involving individuals from marketing, engineering, operations, customer service and senior management. 
 Installing and integrating new equipment requires a substantial investment by a customer. Sales of Intevac’s systems depend, in significant part, upon the decision of a prospective customer to replace obsolete equipment or to increase manufacturing capacity by upgrading or expanding existing manufacturing facilities or by constructing new manufacturing facilities, all of which typically involve a significant capital commitment. Intevac’s systems have a lengthy sales cycle, during which Intevac may expend substantial funds and management time and effort with no assurance that a sale will result. 
 The production of large complex systems requires Intevac to make significant investments in inventory both to fulfill customer orders and to maintain adequate supplies of spare parts to service previously shipped systems. Intevac maintains inventories of spare parts in the United States, Singapore, Malaysia and China to support its TFE customers. Intevac often requires its TFE customers to pay for systems in three installments, with a portion of the system price billed upon receipt of an order, a portion of the price billed upon shipment, and the balance of the price and any sales tax due upon completion of installation and acceptance of the system at the customer’s factory. 
 Intevac provides process and applications support, customer training, installation, start-up assistance and post-installation service support to Intevac’s TFE customers. Intevac supports US customers from Intevac headquarters in Santa Clara, California, and has field offices in Singapore, China, and Malaysia to support customers in Asia. 
 Warranties for Intevac’s TFE products typically range between 12 and 24 months from customer acceptance. During the warranty period any necessary non-consumable parts are supplied and installed without charge. 
 Sales of Photonics products for military applications are primarily made to the end user through Intevac’s direct sales force. Intevac sells to the U.S. government and to leading defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Elbit Systems of America, Raytheon, Leonardo DRS, BAE Systems and Safran Electronics and Defense. 
 
9 

  Intevac is subject to long sales cycles in the Photonics segment because many of Intevac’s products, such as Intevac’s night-vision systems, typically must be designed into Intevac’s customers’ products, which are often complex and state-of-the-art. These development cycles are generally multi-year, and Intevac’s sales are dependent on Intevac’s customer successfully integrating Intevac’s product into its product, completing development of its product and then obtaining production orders for its product. Sales of these products are also often dependent on ongoing funding of defense programs by the U.S. government and its allies. Additionally, sales to international customers are contingent on issuance of export licenses by the U.S. government. 
 Photonics generally invoices its research and development customers either as costs are incurred, or as program milestones are achieved, depending upon the particular contract terms. As a government contractor, Intevac invoices customers using estimated annual rates approved by the Defense Contracts Audit Agency (“DCAA”). 
 Research and Development and Intellectual Property 
 Intevac’s long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new products. Intevac works closely with Intevac’s customers to design products that meet their planned technical and production requirements. Product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the United States and Singapore. 
 Intevac’s competitive position significantly depends on Intevac’s research, development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and not just on Intevac’s patent position. However, protection of Intevac’s technological assets by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights, including patents, is important. Therefore, Intevac’s practice is to file patent applications in the United States and other countries for inventions that Intevac considers important. Although Intevac does not consider Intevac’s business materially dependent upon any one patent, the rights of Intevac and the products made and sold under Intevac’s patents along with other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets and copyrights, taken as a whole, are a significant element of Intevac’s business. 
 Intevac enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in Intevac’s best interest to do so. Intevac pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for use of certain patented technologies in several of Intevac’s products. 
 In the normal course of business, Intevac periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringements. In dealing with such inquiries, it may be necessary or useful for us to obtain or grant licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If Intevac is not able to resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary licenses and/or successfully prosecute or defend Intevac’s position, Intevac’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Manufacturing 
 Intevac manufactures its TFE products at its facilities in California and Singapore. Intevac’s TFE manufacturing operations include electromechanical assembly, vacuum processing, fabrication of sputter sources, and system assembly, alignment and testing. 
 Photonics products are manufactured at Intevac’s facility in California. Photonics manufactures sensors, cameras, integrated camera systems, and near-eye display systems using advanced manufacturing techniques and equipment. Intevac’s operations include vacuum processing, and electromechanical and optical system assembly. 
 Government Regulations 
 We are subject to various government regulations in the United States as well as various international locations where we operate. These regulations cover several diverse areas including environmental compliance, import and export controls, economic sanctions, data and privacy protection, transfer pricing rules, anti-bribery, anti-trafficking and anti-trust provisions. Our policies mandate compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by various state, federal and international agencies. We instituted various training programs to educate our employees on compliance with governmental regulations, as well as applied legal and ethical practices in our everyday work. We are subject to international, federal, state, and local legislation, regulations, and other requirements relating to the use, storage, discharge, handling, emission, generation, manufacture, treatment and disposal of toxic or otherwise hazardous substances, chemicals, materials or waste; recycling and 
 
10 

  product packaging; worker health and safety; and other activities affecting the environment, our workforce, and the management of our manufacturing operations. We believe that our operations and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws. We treat the cost of complying with government regulations and operating a safe workplace as a normal cost of business and allocates the cost of these activities to all functions, except where the cost can be isolated and charged to a specific function. The environmental standards and regulations promulgated by government agencies in California and Singapore are particularly rigorous and set a high standard of compliance. We believe our costs of compliance with these regulations and standards are comparable to other companies operating similar facilities in these jurisdictions. We are also subject to import/export controls, tariffs, and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in the countries in which we have operations or otherwise do business. These controls, tariffs, regulations, and restrictions (including those related to, or affected by, United States-China relations) have had, and we believe may continue to have, a material impact on our business, including our ability to sell products and to manufacture or source components. Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. In addition, many federal and state laws materially affect our operations. These laws relate to ethics, labor, tax, and employment matters. As any employer is, we are subject to federal and state statutes and regulations governing their standards of business conduct with the government, including that government contracts typically contain provisions permitting government clients to terminate contracts without cause with limited notice or compensation. The development of additional statutes and regulations and interpretation of existing statutes and regulations with respect to our industry can be expected to evolve over time. As with any commercial enterprise, we cannot predict with certainty the nature or direction of the development of federal statutes and regulations that will affect its business operations. 
 Human Capital Resources 
 General Information About Our Human Capital Resources 
 As of January 2, 2021, we had 269 employees, including 3 contract employees. Approximately 71% of our employees are located in the United States and 29% are located in Asia. Of our total workforce, 86 employees are involved in research and development; 115 employees are involved in operations, manufacturing, service and quality assurance; and 68 employees are involved in sales, order administration, marketing, finance, information technology, general management and other administrative functions.

Community Involvement 
 Our employees are committed to making a difference in the community by actively volunteering and fundraising for many charities, including American Cancer Society, Second Harvest, Human Society, Make a Wish, and Salvation Army. 
Health and Safety 
 The health and safety of our employees is of utmost importance to us. We conduct regular self-assessments and audits to ensure compliance with our health and safety guidelines and regulatory requirements. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a level of work-related injuries as close to zero as possible through continuous investment in our safety programs. We provide protective gear (e.g. eye protection, masks and gloves) as required by applicable standards and as appropriate given employee job duties. Annual participation in trainings related to ethics, environment, health and safety, and emergency responses are at or near 100%.

Hiring Practices 
It is our policy to hire and promote the best-qualified person for the job and comply fully with all domestic, foreign and local laws relating to discrimination in the workplace. Our good faith outreach efforts are designed to ensure that there are no barriers for members of any group and to encourage interest by all qualified persons. We believe our actions enhance diversity, including recruiting at venues representing women, minorities and U.S. military veterans. 
Turnover 
We continually monitor employee turnover rates, both regionally and as a whole, as our success depends upon retaining our highly trained engineering, manufacturing and operating personnel. The average tenure of our employees is 9.8 years in the United States and 9.5 years in Asia. 
Diversity and Inclusion 
Recognizing and respecting our global presence, we strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive workforce everywhere we operate. We believe that a diverse and motivated workforce is vital to our success. We strive to advance diversity and inclusion through various talent acquisition programs to attract, retain and develop a diverse, highly-skilled work force. We conduct employee surveys to provide on-going feedback on how we are doing against our commitment to treat all employees fairly and provide equal opportunity in an environment free of discrimination. Our diversity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training, in particular by educating employees about our policies against harassment and bullying and about the elimination of bias in the workplace. 
Management Team 
We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our chief executive officer and business unit leaders average approximately 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented professional team. 
Training and Talent Development 
We are committed to the continued development of our employees. Strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur on a planned cadence annually – globally and across all business areas. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation leaders. We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established specialized programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in management, engineering, and operations. We also provide technical, professional and leadership training to our employees. We recognize and support the growth and development of our employees and offer opportunities to participate in internal as well as external learning opportunities. 
Compensation and Benefits 
We strive to offer employees regionally competitive compensation and benefits that are aligned to our values. All employees receive a base salary, incentive compensation and welfare benefits. Depending on the region, benefits include medical, dental and vision coverage, short and long-term disability income protection, flexible spending plans (health, dependent and limited flexible spending) and basic and supplemental life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and retirement savings plan. Intevac pays the majority or all of the costs for these benefits. 
We have various employee incentive plans. Our profit-sharing plan provides for the distribution of a percentage of pre-tax profits to substantially all of our employees not eligible for other performance-based incentive plans. Our executives and key contributors participate in bonus plans based on the achievement of profitability and other individual performance goals and objectives. 
To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with our stockholders we grant equity-based awards, including restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) to eligible employees. We also have an employee stock purchase plan, which provides employees with the opportunity to purchase Intevac common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of these plans.
