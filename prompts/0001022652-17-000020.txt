Item 1.    Business
Overview
Inseego Corp. is a leading global provider of software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) and solutions for the Internet of Things (“IoT”). We sell telematics solutions globally under the Ctrack™ brand, including our fleet management, asset tracking and monitoring, stolen vehicle recovery and usage-based insurance platforms. We also sell connectivity solutions and device management services. Our products and solutions provide anywhere, anytime communications and analytics for consumers and businesses of all sizes, with approximately 620,000 global subscribers, including 432,000 subscribers for our Ctrack branded fleet management and vehicle telematics solutions and 188,000 subscribers for our connectivity and device management services. 
We have invented and reinvented ways in which the world stays connected and accesses information. With multiple first-to-market innovations and a strong and growing portfolio of hardware and software innovations for IoT, our companies have been advancing technology and driving industry transformation for over 30 years. It is this proven expertise and commitment to quality and innovation that makes us a preferred global partner of operators, distributors, system integrators, businesses and consumers.
Inseego is a Delaware corporation formed in 2016 and is the successor to Novatel Wireless, a Delaware corporation formed in 1996, as a result of an internal reorganization that was completed in November 2016 (the “Reorganization”) to separate the Company’s MiFi branded hotspots and USB modem product lines (the “MiFi Business”) from the assets and liabilities associated with our Ctrack fleet and vehicle telematics solutions and our business connectivity and device management solutions. Upon completion of the Reorganization, Novatel Wireless became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Inseego and Novatel Wireless’s former stockholders became stockholders of Inseego, with shares of Inseego common stock trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol “INSG.” 
Recent and Pending Divestitures
On April 11, 2016, we signed a definitive Asset Purchase Agreement with Telit Technologies (Cyprus) Limited and Telit Wireless Solutions, Inc. (collectively, “Telit”) pursuant to which we sold, and Telit acquired, certain hardware modules and related assets (the “Modules Business”). With subsequent modifications pursuant to a Final Resolution Letter Agreement dated September 29, 2016, the aggregate purchase consideration for the Modules Business totaled $11.7 million, which consisted of $11.3 million in cash and $0.4 million in net settled company liabilities.
On September 21, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among Inseego and Novatel Wireless, on the one hand, and T.C.L. Industries Holdings (H.K.) Limited and Jade Ocean Global Limited (collectively, the “Purchasers”) on the other hand. The Purchase Agreement relates to the pending sale of our subsidiary, Novatel Wireless, which includes the MiFi Business, to the Purchasers for $50.0 million in cash, subject to potential adjustment for Novatel Wireless’s working capital as of the closing date. The sale may not close until all of the closing conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement have been satisfied. One of the closing conditions is the approval of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”). CFIUS has identified national security concerns relating to our sale of the MiFi Business to the Purchasers. In early February 2017, the Company and the Purchasers voluntarily withdrew and re-filed their notice to CFIUS in order to obtain additional time to provide further information to CFIUS and explore potential mitigation measures that may allow the transaction to proceed. In early March 2017, CFIUS provided a draft mitigation agreement which, if finalized, would allow CFIUS approval to be granted. Negotiations between CFIUS and the Purchasers regarding the final terms of such mitigation agreement remain ongoing. 
Our Sources of Revenue
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company’s total net revenues were $243.6 million, $220.9 million and $185.2 million, respectively, including our divested Modules Business. Our MiFi Business generated solely hardware revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, with net revenues of $145.3 million, $152.4 million and $148.6 million, respectively. Our divested Modules Business also generated solely hardware revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, with net revenues of $4.5 million, $12.3 million and $11.6 million, respectively.
SaaS, Software and Services
Inseego sells SaaS, software and services solutions across multiple IoT vertical markets, including fleet management and vehicle telematics, usage-based insurance, stolen vehicle recovery, asset tracking and monitoring, business connectivity and

device management. Our platforms are device-agnostic and provide a standardized, scalable way to order, connect and manage remote assets and improve business operations. The platforms are flexible and support both on-premise server or cloud-based deployments and are the basis for the delivery of a wide range of IoT services.
Our SaaS delivery platforms include (i) our Ctrack platforms, which provide fleet, vehicle, asset and other SaaS telematics, (ii) our Crossroads™ platform, which provides easy IoT device management and service enablement and (iii) our Device Management Solutions (“DMS”), a hosted SaaS platform that helps organizations manage the selection, deployment and spend of their wireless assets, saving money on personnel and telecom expenses.
IoT Hardware
Our integrated telematics and mobile tracking hardware is predominantly sold as an enabler for our Ctrack SaaS delivery platforms. Our telematics and mobile tracking hardware devices collect and control critical vehicle data and driver behaviors, and can reliably deliver that information to the cloud, all managed by our services enablement platforms. Our wireless routers are sold both as stand-alone devices and as part of a bundled business connectivity solution, including our Crossroads platform and wireless connectivity services via our carrier partners.
MiFi Business
We are in the process of divesting our MiFi Business. See “Recent and Pending Divestitures.” While the sale is pending, we are continuing to operate the MiFi Business through our subsidiary, Novatel Wireless. The MiFi Business designs, develops and manufactures through third party contract manufacturers, markets and sells mobile hotspots, USB modems and routers which provide subscribers with secure and convenient high-speed access to corporate, public and personal information through the Internet and enterprise networks via wireless cellular networks. Development and testing of our MiFi hardware products is primarily done in-house by our engineering team in San Diego, California, with some contract work done by unaffiliated third parties overseas. We do not have our own manufacturing facilities for MiFi hardware products. We predominantly rely on Inventec Appliances Corporation, located in China, to build our MiFi hardware products. Our MiFi hardware products are sold by our direct sales force, predominantly in the United States and predominantly to a single customer, Verizon Wireless, although we also sell some MiFi hardware to United States Cellular Corporation, Bell Canada and Verizon Wireless distributors. 
Historically, the MiFi hardware business accounted for a majority of our revenues and a majority of our expenses. This business, however, has relatively low gross margins and operates in a very competitive market environment. While our MiFi hotspot products tend to have advanced features which often enable them to be sold at premium prices when they are first introduced, we also have higher costs than most of our competitors due to our small scale and heavy use of U.S.-based engineers in product development. Most of our competitors have substantially greater resources and scale, as would be expected in the relatively mature, consumer electronics product categories which comprise our MiFi Business. Our wireless data modem and mobile hotspots, for example, compete against similar products offered by Huawei, ZTE, Sierra Wireless, TCL, Franklin Wireless and NetGear. More broadly, those products also compete against wireless handset manufacturers such as HTC, Apple, LG and Samsung, which all offer mobile hotspot capability as a feature of their cellular smartphones. 
Because the MiFi Business is not expected to be part of our business going forward, the description of our business below will focus on the portions of our business that we expect to retain going forward.
Our Business
Telematics Solutions
Inseego entered the telematics software and services industry by acquiring Ctrack and its Ctrack-branded products on October 5, 2015. Prior to its acquisition of Ctrack, Inseego sold telematics hardware through its subsidiary, Enfora, Inc. (“Enfora”). Inseego exited the business of selling stand-alone telematics hardware in 2016 and now offers telematics solutions only through Ctrack. Ctrack was founded in South Africa in 1985, and today our operations span over 50 countries on six continents. Through successful global acquisitions, the Ctrack group broadened its international reach by expanding into countries such as the United Kingdom, The Netherlands and Australia and by identifying strong and capable distributors in emerging markets such as Asia, Africa and Europe.
With over 30 years of experience, we are recognized as a leading global provider of advanced fleet management telematics solutions that add value to a global base of customers with mobile assets. We design and develop a robust range of asset management and monitoring systems using GPS satellite positioning, GSM cellular communication and other advanced communication and sensory technologies. The result is innovative solutions ranging from basic track-and-trace, with stolen vehicle response services, to complete integrated enterprise-level solutions for large fleet owners across the globe.

Telematics Solutions
Fleet Management 
For commercial customers of small, medium or large fleets, our GPS/GSM tracking technology and proprietary software enables us to deliver some of the world’s most advanced and complete fleet management solutions. Ctrack’s fleet management products offer customers fuel and maintenance cost savings, real-time visibility, operational control and efficiency and productivity improvements, as well as enhanced safety and security for fleet vehicles and mobile assets. Customers may also receive environmental benefits from route optimization and CO2 emission reporting. Standard and customized reporting, combined with dashboard views, gives fleet operators automated or on-demand information on an entire fleet or individual vehicle. As fleet operations often rely on a variety of systems for operational effectiveness and efficiency, we focus on providing seamless integration of Ctrack systems that connect and share data with third-party systems. This in turn helps customers increase their competitiveness.
Workforce Tracking
Ctrack enables customers to accurately monitor and assess the movement and behavior of their mobile workforces. As a result, Ctrack helps its customers manage their workforces in real-time for greatly improved planning and delivery, utilization, service levels and customer satisfaction. Additional workforce and driver benefits have been introduced through Ctrack’s Fleet Protector™. Fleet Protector gives employees 24-hour access to an emergency call center with transport costs covered and guaranteed hospital acceptance following an accident.
Government, Local Council and Municipality Asset Management
The Ctrack Government, Local Council and Municipalities Monitoring and Tracking System allows local authorities and utility providers to scrutinize, assess and act on information in real time to limit theft and abuse of equipment and maximize the safety and productivity of employees. Using a Ctrack tracking system, local authorities and utility companies can streamline workflow management by verifying route completion, identifying and dispatching the most appropriate vehicle to a job to reduce unnecessary mileage and react more quickly to customer requirements. This not only increases the number of completed jobs per day by optimizing mobile resources, but also reduces overhead and realizes substantial environmental benefits by improving fuel efficiency. Furthermore, our driver behavior solutions have a considerable operational impact by improving the way employees drive in order to enhance levels of efficiency and responsibility, as well as protect public perception and corporate image.

Advanced Data Analytics and Lifecycle Asset Management
Ctrack’s Lifecycle Asset Management Division helps customers derive enhanced value from the vast amounts of data generated from their fleet management systems. Using rich fleet analytics and the sophisticated interpretation of data, Ctrack Fleet Analytics™ provides the information needed for critical and proactive decision making, from cost savings to future fleet investments. This outsourced solution enables customers to receive expert analysis without the overhead of employing analysts. Ctrack’s comprehensive analytics software solutions provide access to an array of tools to manage routing, scheduling and every other aspect of a customer’s fleet.
Insurance Telematics 
Big data analytics can enable advancements and innovation in the short-term vehicle insurance industry, addressing both top-line growth opportunities and bottom-line risk and cost management challenges. Ctrack’s Insurance Telematics Division provides insurance companies with factual reports on driving frequency, times and routes of the insured, as well as insights into their client’s driving behavior, such as harsh acceleration, braking, cornering and other pertinent information. This rich, contextual, vehicle-use confirmation is a key enabler for actuaries to effectively build risk models and calculate scorecards for individual and collective driver-behavior analysis. Risk profiling and real-time monitoring, along with Ctrack’s accident analysis reports, are also helping insurance companies accelerate the claims process, reduce payouts related to fraudulent claims, and significantly improve their loss ratios.
Airport Asset Tracking
Ctrack’s Airport Solution gives airport ground support equipment service providers a GPS-based airport equipment management solution that provides controlled access to their equipment, as well as real-time visibility, through a web-based SaaS platform. Our comprehensive solution is designed to meet the demands of airport authorities while also improving services to their clients, including air service providers and logistics companies. Our solutions ensure accuracy in the administrative processes, as well as the ability to select additional services, such as visibility into equipment usage, access control and geo-location. With a planning and visibility tool, ground service equipment service providers always know who is using what, when and where. Our solution also gives such providers the ability to provide exact invoices based on the usage per client, per cost center and even per individual.
Vehicle Tracking
Ctrack’s vehicle tracking products offer a high level of functionality that provide safety and security for vehicles, families and businesses, as well as other lifestyle benefits, all contributing to greater peace of mind and convenience. Customers can locate their vehicles using mobile phones and smart devices such as tablets, view trip details on Ctrack’s advanced internet applications, keep an electronic tax logbook, and even receive support from emergency services following an accident. We are continually developing our portfolio of value-added safety and security features and services to deliver peace-of-mind for our customers. Additional features and services range from panic buttons and medical and roadside assistance to home-drive and legal services. Ctrack’s driver-style profiling system also detects abnormal driving patterns and unauthorized drivers, allowing the support center to proactively respond to possible emergency, vehicle theft or accident situations.

Our revenues from sales to Verizon Wireless represented approximately 54% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our IoT and telematics solutions and services primarily to enterprises and tier-one carriers in the following industries: transportation, government and local municipalities, mining, agriculture, construction, professional services, finance and insurance, energy and industrial automation, and security and safety. These products and solutions are sold by our direct sales force, including our call centers, and through distributors.
We engage in a wide variety of sales and marketing activities, driving market leadership and global demand through integrated marketing campaigns. This includes product marketing, corporate communications, brand marketing and demand generation.
A substantial majority of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016 was derived from sales in the United States. See Note 13, Geographic Information and Concentrations of Risk, to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our revenue and asset concentrations by geographic location. In 2017 and beyond, we expect the majority of our revenue to be derived from sales outside the United States, assuming the successful divestiture of the MiFi Business. For information regarding risks related to our foreign operations, see the information in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part 1 of this report.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts are focused on developing innovative IoT and telematics solutions and services, and improving the functionality, design and performance of our products and solutions. Our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $30.7 million, $35.4 million and $34.3 million, respectively. These research and development expenses include expenses associated with our MiFi Business and divested Modules Business.
We intend to continue to identify and respond to our customers’ needs by introducing new SaaS and IoT solutions and product designs that meet our market and customers’ needs, with an emphasis on creating easy-to-use products and services that enable customers to connect, track, and manage their business systems and assets.
We manage our research and development through a structured life-cycle process, from identifying initial customer requirements through development and commercial introduction to eventual phase-out. During product development, emphasis is placed on quality, reliability, performance, time-to-market, meeting industry standards and customer-product specifications, ease of integration, cost reduction, and manufacturability.
Manufacturing and Operations
The hardware used in our solutions is produced by contract manufacturers. Our current contract manufacturers include Inventec Appliances Corporation and AsiaTelco Technologies Co. Under our manufacturing agreements, contract manufacturers provide us with services including component procurement, product manufacturing, final assembly, testing, quality control and fulfillment. These contract manufacturers are located in China and South Africa and are able to produce our products using modern state-of-the-art equipment and facilities with relatively low-cost labor. 
10

We outsource our higher volume manufacturing in an effort to:

• | focus on our core competencies of design, development and marketing;

• | realize manufacturing economies of scale;


• | achieve production scalability by adjusting manufacturing volumes to meet changes in demand; and


• | access best-in-class component procurement and manufacturing resources.

Our operations team manages our relationships with the contract manufacturers as well as other key suppliers. Our operations team focuses on supply chain management, quality, cost optimization, customer order management and new product introduction.
Intellectual Property
Our solutions rely on and benefit from our portfolio of intellectual property, including patents and trademarks. We currently own 36 United States patents and 29 foreign patents. In addition, we currently have 34 patent applications pending. The patents that we currently own expire at various times between 2021 and 2034.
We, along with our subsidiaries, also hold a number of trademarks or registered trademarks including “Inseego”, the Inseego logo, “DigiCore”, “Ctrack”, the Ctrack logo, “FW”, “Crossroads”, the FW logo, “Novatel Wireless”, the Novatel Wireless logo, “MiFi”, “MiFi Intelligent Mobile Hotspot”, “MiFi OS”, “MiFi Powered”, “MiFi Home”, “MobiLink”, “Ovation”, “Expedite”, “MiFi Freedom. My Way.”, “Enfora”, “Spider”, “Enabling Information Anywhere”, “Enabler” and “N4A”. 
Backlog
We do not believe that backlog is currently a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects due to many variables, some of which are outside of our control, which could cause the actual volume of our product shipments to differ from those that comprise our backlog. Additionally, we sometimes have relatively short lead times between receipt of customer purchase orders and shipment of products.
Competition
The market for IoT and telematics services and solutions is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. It is likely to continue to be significantly affected by new product introductions and industry participants.
We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products are features and functionality, performance, quality and brand. To maintain and improve our competitive position, we must continue to expand our customer base, grow our distribution network, and leverage our strategic relationships.
Our products compete with a variety of telematics solutions providers and IoT solutions suppliers. Our current competitors include:

• | fleet management SaaS and services providers, such as Fleetmatics, Masternaut, TomTom, Telogis, MiX Telematics and Cartrack;


• | IoT solution providers, such as Cradlepoint and Sierra Wireless; and
