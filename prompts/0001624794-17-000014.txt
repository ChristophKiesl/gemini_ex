ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Overview
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 6, 2014 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Capital Southwest Corporation (“Capital Southwest”). We were formed solely for the purpose of effecting the distribution of our outstanding shares of common stock on a pro rata basis to holders of Capital Southwest common stock (the “Share Distribution”) and to become the owner of a group of manufacturing companies that were held by Capital Southwest prior to the Share Distribution. The Share Distribution was completed on September 30, 2015, resulting in CSWI becoming a standalone, publicly-traded company.
Our Company
We are a diversified industrial growth company with well-established, scalable platforms and domain expertise across three business segments: Industrial Products; Coatings, Sealants & Adhesives; and Specialty Chemicals. Our broad portfolio of leading products provides performance optimizing solutions to our customers. Our products include mechanical products for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) and refrigeration applications, coatings and sealants and high performance specialty lubricants. Markets that we serve include HVAC, industrial, rail, plumbing, architecturally-specified building products, energy, mining and other general industrial markets. Our operations are concentrated in the United States (“U.S.”), but we also have distribution sales in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and our products are sold directly or through designated channels in over 100 countries around the world, including: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, the Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S.
Drawing on our innovative and proven technologies, we seek to deliver solutions to our professional customers that require superior performance and reliability. We believe that our industrial brands, such as RectorSeal No. 5® and KOPR-KOTE®, are well known in the specific industries we serve and have a reputation for high quality and reliability. Through organic growth and acquisitions, we believe that we are well positioned to offer our customers an increasingly broad portfolio of performance optimizing solutions. We have a successful record of making accretive acquisitions – in the last five fiscal years, we have completed 13 acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $193.7 million. We believe that there are further attractive acquisition opportunities available within the markets in which we operate.
We have a long history of providing high quality specialty chemicals, coatings, sealants and other products, accompanied by dependable service and attention to customer satisfaction. Our specialty lubricants were used on the excavation equipment for the Panama Canal in the late 1800s. We also have a long history of innovation. We believe that we were the first to develop a method for removing internal acid from air conditioning and refrigeration systems, pioneering the market for acid neutralizers. We partner with our customers to solve specific challenges, such as environment-friendly lubricants, which were specifically developed to provide high performance in rail applications combined with biodegradability and no eco-toxicity and to satisfy strict environmental requirements.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
Broad Portfolio of Industry Leading Products and Solutions
We have a broad portfolio of products with leading industry positions in the specific end markets in which we operate. We believe our products and solutions are differentiated from those of our competitors by superior performance, quality and total value delivered to customers. For example, our RectorSeal No. 5® product is widely regarded as an industry standard for thread sealants for HVAC, plumbing and electrical configurations. Additionally, we believe our KOPR-KOTE® product is recognized as the anti-seize compound of choice for use in oil and gas drilling operations, where it is asked for by name.
Sustainable Organic Revenue Growth and Operating Performance
We focus on end markets with strong growth trends, such as HVAC and construction. We also have a loyal customer base that recognizes the performance and quality of our products and solutions, including continuously evaluating the potential uses of existing products to broaden our market penetration. Further, our customer base is diverse – for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, no single customer represented 10% or more of our net revenues.
These factors have enabled us to generate strong margin performance. We are focused on improving our profitability through targeted investments to further optimize our manufacturing processes. For example, in our Coatings, Sealants & Adhesives 
1

segment, we are completing the process of consolidating the manufacturing of some of our coatings products into our Longview, Texas and Acworth, Georgia facilities in order to optimize capacity, improve efficiency and leverage technologies while enhancing product quality. Further, we continually look to refine our manufacturing processes in all of our manufacturing facilities to lower manufacturing costs, increase production capacity and improve product quality.
Stable Platform for Acquisitions with Proven Track Record
We believe that our experience in identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions is one of our core competitive strengths, as evidenced by the 35 acquisitions, which we have successfully completed since 1991. Since April 1, 2012, we have invested $193.7 million in acquisitions that either (1) added new products designed to service our existing end markets, or (2) provided an entry into new, complementary end markets where we can drive revenue growth and improved profitability. Historically, our acquisitions have been relatively small, lower-risk acquisitions of a product that we have identified as having the potential to benefit from our extensive distribution network and manufacturing efficiencies. We have also consummated larger acquisitions that complement our business model.
We completed one acquisition during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, and three acquisitions during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Effective March 1, 2017, we acquired Greco Aluminum Railings, a leading manufacturer of high-quality engineered railing and safety systems for multi-family and commercial structures. Effective April 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Strathmore, a leading participant in the coatings market. Effective October 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Deacon Industries, Inc., a leading manufacturer of high temperature sealants and injectable packings. Effective December 15, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of AC Leak Freeze, a leading manufacturer of original equipment manufacturer-safe air conditioning and refrigerant leak repair solutions.
Culture of Product Enhancement and Customer Centric Solutions
We have a long history of serving our customers with high quality products and solutions. We work closely with our customers, industry experts and research partners to continuously improve our existing products to meet evolving customer and market requirements. Our highly trained and specialized personnel work directly with our current and prospective customers to enhance our product offerings by expanding the use and markets for our existing products. We focus on product enhancements and product line extensions that are designed to meet the specific application needs of our customers. We believe this focus has helped us build strong industrial brands and develop a reputation for high quality, in turn leading us to realize improved customer retention and loyalty. Further, our ability to meet the needs of high-value niche end markets with customized solutions that leverage our existing products has enabled us to differentiate ourselves from our larger competitors that may not have the flexibility or interest in responding quickly to evolving customer demands in these smaller, niche markets.
Diverse Sales and Distribution Channels
Many of our products are sold through service-intensive distribution networks committed to technical support and customer satisfaction. We primarily market through an international network of independent manufacturer representatives and agents calling on our wholesale distributors, contractors and direct customers. The strong, long-term relationships we have developed with our wholesale distribution partners allow us to introduce new products, including both newly developed and acquired products. In addition, our extensive distribution network allows us to reach and serve niche end markets that provide organic growth opportunities and form a key component of our acquisition strategy.
With certain of our products, we also market through a direct sales force focused on specific customer needs. For example, we sell products in our Coatings, Sealants & Adhesive segment directly to rail car and locomotive manufacturers.
Our Growth Strategy
We are focused on creating significant stockholder value over the long term by increasing our revenue, profitability and free cash flow through: (1) expanding the markets and uses for our existing products; and, (2) growing the portfolio of products we manufacture, market and sell through targeted acquisitions. We believe the key drivers of our growth include:
Benefits Resulting from the Share Distribution
Historically, our operating companies functioned as independent companies with discrete strategies and capital structures. The Share Distribution has allowed us, as an independent, standalone company, to pursue a strategy focused on rationalizing our organizational structure and management around our three business segments. We expect this strategy to enable us to realize cost and operational synergies, implement best practices across our operations, cross-sell product offerings and, as a result, grow our market share and increase our profitability.
Additionally, we believe our integrated structure allows us to more effectively allocate capital across our three business segments, enabling more efficient financing of operations and planned growth.

Leveraging Existing Customer Relationships and Products and Solutions
We expect to drive revenue growth by leveraging our reputation for providing high quality products to our long-standing customer base. Our team of sales representatives, engineers and other technical personnel continues to proactively collaborate with our distributors and end users to enhance and adapt existing products and solutions to meet evolving customer needs. In addition, we seek to leverage our existing customer base to cross-sell our products and solutions across our three business segments, thereby driving organic growth.
Focused Acquisitions that Leverage our Distribution Channels
While we are focused on improving our existing products and penetrating new markets with these products, we expect to continue to identify and execute acquisitions that will broaden our portfolio of products and offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. We primarily focus on commercially proven products and solutions that would benefit from a broader distribution network and are attractive to our customers in target end markets. Once acquired, our intent is to utilize our extensive distribution networks to increase revenue by selling those products to our diversified customer base.
Operational Excellence
We focus on operational excellence in all aspects of our business, with the end goals of improved efficiencies and increased profitability. We continue to expand improvement initiatives and information sharing across our operating platform. Since the Share Distribution, we have identified approximately $10 million in annual savings, driven primarily by facility consolidations and our global procurement initiatives. Across the organization, we generated approximately $2 million in net annual savings in Fiscal 2017 through our procurement programs. Manufacturing footprint optimization, including the consolidation of our lubrication and grease manufacturing during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, is expected to generate approximately $5 million in annual savings in our Specialty Chemicals segment. We achieved approximately $3 million of the Specialty Chemicals segment savings during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, and full run-rate savings are expected to be achieved during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018. Additionally, we are completing the process of consolidating the manufacturing of some of our coatings products into our Longview, Texas and Acworth, Georgia facilities in order to optimize capacity and improve efficiency, which we expect to generate approximately $2 million in annual run rate savings over the next 18 months in our Coatings, Sealants & Adhesives segment. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” (“Item 8”) of this Annual Report for financial and other information regarding our acquisitions.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Our products are manufactured using various raw materials, including base oils, copper flake, aluminum, polyvinyl chloride and tetra-hydrofuran. These raw materials are available from numerous sources and we do not anticipate significant shortages of such materials in the future. We generally purchase these raw materials and components as needed. We do not depend on a single source of supply for any significant raw materials.
Intellectual Property
We own a number of trademarks and patents relating to the names and designs of our products. We consider our trademarks and patents to be valuable assets of our business. In addition, our pool of proprietary information, consisting of know-how and trade secrets related to the design, manufacture and operation of our products, is considered particularly valuable. Accordingly, we take proactive measures to protect such proprietary information. In aggregate, we own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell and are not materially encumbered by licensing or franchise agreements. Our trademarks can typically be renewed indefinitely as long as they remain in use, whereas our existing patents generally expire 10 to 20 years from the dates they were filed, which has occurred at various times in the past. We do not believe that the expiration of any individual patent will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Export Regulations
We are subject to export control regulations in countries from which we export products and services. These controls may apply by virtue of the country in which the products are located or by virtue of the origin of the content contained in the products. If the controls of a particular country apply, the level of control generally depends on the nature of the goods and services in question. Where controls apply, the export of our products generally requires an export license or authorization (either on a per-product or per transaction basis) or that the transaction qualify for a license exception or the equivalent, and may also be subject to corresponding reporting requirements. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for financial and other information regarding our operations on a geographical basis.
Environmental Regulations
Our operations are subject to certain foreign, federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental, waste management, labor and health and safety matters. Management believes that our business is operated in material compliance 
3

with all such regulations. To date, the cost of such compliance has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position or that of our operating subsidiaries. Despite the existence of policies, practices and procedures to prevent and mitigate risks, violations may occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Further, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by us and could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Employees
As of March 31, 2017, we employed approximately 750 individuals. Of these employees, 27 are represented by unions. We believe relations with our employees throughout our operations are generally satisfactory, including those employees represented by unions. No unionized facility accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended March 31, 2017.

New Product Development – Customer experience is a core competency in our Industrial Products segment. We gather "voice of the customer" market research through organized focus groups and online surveys, as well as through less formal channels. Ideas for new products or enhancements to existing products are also generated by our relationships with end users, independent sales representatives, distributors and our internal sales and marketing team. We also actively monitor the competitive landscape using a variety of methods. We develop new products and modify existing products in our research and development (“R&D”) labs in Houston, Texas; Rockwall, Texas; Boise, Idaho; Wichita, Kansas; and Windsor, Canada.
Competition – Our competition in the Industrial Products segment is varied. Competitors range from small entrepreneurial companies with a single product, to large multinational original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In the specialty mechanical products category, we compete with Diversitech, Supco, Little Giant, Mitsubishi, Cherne, Mainline and JR Smith. Most of these products are sold through distribution channels, and we compete based on breadth of product line, customer service and pricing. In the fire and smoke protection category we compete with Won Door, Stoebich, McKeon and others, typically on the basis of product innovation, knowledge of building codes and customer service. In the architecturally-specified building products category, we compete primarily with Emseal, Inpro, and MM Systems on the basis of product innovation, price and driving architectural specifications. In the lubricant storage, filtration and transfer space, we compete with Des-Case, Hy-Pro, IFH and others on the basis of superior performance, brand strength and breadth of product line.

Some of these are local single location distributors, but many are regional or national in scope with hundreds of locations. The majority of these products are sold domestically; however, a small portion is sold internationally through similar channels, and a small number of OEMs purchase these products directly. Fire and smoke protection products are sold through local building products distributors who also perform installations and service. Architecturally-specified building products are sold primarily through a network of distributors. Storage, filtration and application products are marketed and sold worldwide through a service-intensive distribution network.
Seasonality – A significant portion of our products are sold into the HVAC market, which is seasonal by nature. While products are sold throughout the year, sales tend to peak during summer months.
Coatings, Sealants & Adhesives
Our Coatings, Sealants & Adhesives segment is comprised of coatings and penetrants, pipe thread sealants, firestopping sealants and caulks and adhesives/solvent cements, which are primarily manufactured internally. We are dedicated to adding value to our customers through focused industry application expertise, diverse industrial coatings technologies, manufacturing excellence and quick response services.

New Product Development – We generate new ideas for products or enhancements to existing products through our strong customer and industry knowledge and focus on delivering value to our customers. We develop new and modified products and services that improve the performance of our products, the application of our products, or make it easier for our customers to operate more efficiently. We also actively monitor the competitive landscape through a variety of methods. New products are developed and existing products are modified in our R&D labs in Syracuse, New York; Houston, Texas; and Rockwall, Texas.
Competition – The competitive environment for products in our Coatings, Sealants & Adhesives segment is varied. For coatings, competitors include the industrial paint divisions of Sherwin Williams, PPG Industries, Valspar Corporation and Akzo Nobel, as well as other coatings companies such as Carboline, Hempel, Jotun and smaller regional coatings producers. Competitors of our sealants and adhesives products include Dow Corning Corporation, Henkel, 3M Company, Specified Technologies Inc and Hilti. We compete primarily on the basis of product differentiation, superior performance, quality and customer-centric service.
Customers – For coatings, we primarily serve OEMs and end users in rail, energy, general industrial, power generation and marine markets through our direct sales force and internationally through a distribution network. Customers include rail car and locomotive manufacturers, petrochemical facilities, industrial manufacturers, construction, utilities and plant maintenance customers. We serve sealants and adhesives customers primarily through our distribution network.
Specialty Chemicals
Our Specialty Chemicals segment manufactures and supplies highly specialized consumables that impart or enhance properties such as lubricity, anti-seize qualities, friction and heat control. These materials are typically used in harsh operating conditions, including extreme heat and pressure and chemical exposure, where commodity lubrication products would fail. These products protect and extend the working life of large capital equipment such as cranes, rail systems, mining equipment, oil rigs and rotating and grinding equipment found in various industrial segments such as steel mills, canning and bottling, milling and cement. Additionally, our Specialty Chemicals segment manufactures and supplies specialty products used in the HVAC and refrigeration market. These products enhance, repair or condition the internal working systems of both industrial and residential systems and are critical to ensuring safe, efficient and effective long-term operational integrity. The Specialty Chemicals segment also supplies products and services into the water well treatment space, which includes testing services and diagnosis of current conditions, coupled with consumable solutions to resolve any problems that have been defined.

New Product Development – We develop relationships with end-users and channel partners to understand existing and new operating conditions where technical innovation or enhancement is needed. For example, these relationships have generated innovation in the areas of modifying existing lubrication products to operate in arctic conditions or modifying an existing product for use in an application where salt water may be present. The development teams located in Rockwall, Texas and Houston, Texas are also actively defining new end markets for product use and penetration.
Competition – As our products are specialty, rather than commodity, competitors tend to be varied and include global, regional and local companies that may be large or small. The product sales cycle is long when compared to many consumables, resulting in verifiable and repeatable product performance being the key driver of choice, rather than price. As these products protect and enhance the operation of large capital equipment, qualification is based on the proof of value in application, resulting in a high changeover risk barrier. Typical competitors include Shell, Castrol, Fuchs and Exxon-Mobil. 
Customers – Specialty Chemicals products are primarily sold through value-added distribution partners, as well as maintenance and repair operations or catalog channels. Specialty Chemicals provides both market-specific and product line-specific training to both the distribution partners and potential end users. Our specialists often visit end users with our distribution partners to advise on critical application issues, which enhances our ability to both “pull” demand from the end-user and “push” demand to the distributor partner.
