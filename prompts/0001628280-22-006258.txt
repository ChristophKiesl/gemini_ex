Item 1.    BUSINESS.
Company Overview
Surgalign Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”), (formerly known as RTI Surgical Holdings, Inc. (“RTI”)) is a global medical technology company focused on elevating the standard of care by driving the evolution of digital health. We are developing an augmented reality ("AR") and artificial intelligence ("AI") digital surgery platform called HOLO™ AI, which we believe is one of the most advanced artificial intelligence technologies being applied to surgery. The technology is designed to automatically segment and identify detailed patient spine anatomy, autonomously create a surgical plan for surgeon review, and then provide visual guidance with augmented reality to the surgeon in the surgical field. On January 14, 2022, we received U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) 510(k) clearance for the HOLO Portal™ surgical guidance system utilizing AR and AI to intraoperatively assist spine surgery. HOLO Portal technology combines image-based guidance with AR, automated spine segmentation, and automated surgical planning utilizing proprietary AI software. Intraoperative 3D digital imaging is autonomously processed by the system to create a patient-specific plan that is presented to the surgeon using an AR display. We are developing additional applications based on HOLO AI technology for use in multiple clinical specialties across the continuum of patient care.
In addition to our digital health solutions, we have a broad portfolio of spinal hardware implants, including solutions for fusion procedures in the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine, motion preservation solutions for the lumbar spine, and a minimally invasive surgical implant system for fusion of the sacroiliac joint. We also have a biomaterials portfolio of advanced and traditional orthobiologics. 
We currently market and sell products to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and healthcare providers in the United States and in more than 50 countries worldwide. We are headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois, with commercial, innovation and design centers in San Diego, California; Wurmlingen, Germany; and Warsaw and Poznan, Poland.

As a result of the disposition, among other things, our OEM Businesses and business related to processing donated human musculoskeletal and other tissue and bovine and porcine animal tissue in producing allograft and xenograft implants using BIOCLEANSE®, TUTOPLAST® and CANCELLE® SP sterilization processes were sold to the Buyer and its affiliates for a purchase price of $440.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Further, pursuant to the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement, we sold to the Buyer and its affiliates all of the issued and outstanding shares of RTI OEM, LLC (which, prior to the Transactions, was converted to a corporation and changed its name to “RTI Surgical, Inc.”), RTI Surgical, LLC (which, prior to the Transactions, was converted to a corporation and changed its name to “Pioneer Surgical Technology, Inc.”), Tutogen Medical (United States), Inc. and Tutogen Medical GmbH. The Transactions were previously described in the Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed by us with the SEC on June 18, 2020. Subsequent to the consummation of Transactions, our name was changed to Surgalign Holdings, Inc., operating as Surgalign Spine Technologies. Where obvious and appropriate from the context, references herein to we, or us refer to the Company including the disposed OEM Businesses.
The OEM Businesses met the criteria within Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205-20 – Discontinued Operations, to be reported as discontinued operations because the Transactions were a strategic shift in business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Therefore, we are reporting the historical results of the OEM Businesses including the results of operations and cash flows as discontinued operations, and related assets and liabilities were retrospectively reclassified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations for all periods presented herein. Unless otherwise noted, applicable amounts in the prior year have been recast to conform to this discontinued operations presentation. See Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15, “Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” of this Exhibit for additional information. Unless otherwise indicated, the following information relates to continuing operations. A more complete description of our business prior to the Transactions is included in Item 1. “Business,” in Part I of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 that was previously filed 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 16, 2021, and as amended by our Annual Report (Amendment No. 1) on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on September 24, 2021.
COVID-19
The continued effects of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, as well as the corresponding governmental response and the Company’s management of the crisis has had a significant impact on the Company’s business. The consequences of the outbreak and impact on the global economy continue to evolve, and the full extent of the impact is uncertain with the existence of variant strains of COVID-19. The variant strains have and will continue to lead to a rise in infections resulting in the reinstatement of certain restrictions previously in place on a global scale which includes closure of hospitals. 
Beginning in 2020 and extending through 2021, many hospitals and other medical facilities canceled elective surgeries, reduced and diverted staffing, and diverted other resources to patients suffering from the infectious disease and limited hospital access for non-patients, including the Company’s direct and indirect sales representatives. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgeons and their patients have been required, or are choosing, to defer procedures in which the Company’s products would be used, and many facilities that specialize in the procedures in which the Company’s products would be used have closed or reduced operating hours. The Company continue to see these measures both domestically and internationally taken through December 31, 2021, thus negatively impacting the ability of the Company’s employees and distributors to effectively market and sell its products. In addition, even after the pandemic subsides and/or governmental orders no longer prohibit or recommend against performing such procedures, patients may continue to defer such procedures out of concern of being exposed to COVID-19.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused adverse effects on general commercial activity and the global economy, which led to economic uncertainty throughout 2021, and which has adversely affected the Company’s business, operating results, or financial condition. The adverse effect of the pandemic on the broader economy has also negatively affected demand for procedures using the Company’s products, and could cause one or more of the Company’s distributors, customers, and suppliers to experience financial distress, cancel, postpone, or delay orders, be unable to perform under a contract, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business. This could impact the Company’s ability to provide products and otherwise operate its business, as well as increase its costs and expenses.
The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to and could continue to lead to severe disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase the Company’s cost of future capital and adversely affect its ability to access the capital markets in the future.
The Company cannot predict when its operations will fully return to pre-pandemic levels and will continue to carefully monitor the situation and the needs of the business.
The above and other continued disruptions to the Company’s business as a result of COVID-19 has resulted in a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition. Although vaccines have been made available, it remains uncertain when our business will return to normal operations. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the Company’s business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including the possibility that new adverse information may emerge concerning COVID-19 and additional actions to contain it or treat its impact may be required.
Going Concern
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that we will continue in operation one year after the date these financial statements are issued, and we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had cash of $51.3 million and an accumulated deficit of $569.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had a loss from continuing operations of $122.9 million and a net loss applicable to Surgalign Holdings, Inc. of $84.7 million. The Company has incurred losses from operations in the previous two fiscal years and did not generate positive cash flows from operations in fiscal year 2021 nor in 2020.
On February 15, 2022, we issued and sold in an underwritten public offering 43,478,264 shares of its common stock (or pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in lieu thereof) and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 32,608,698 shares of common stock at a combined effective public offering price of $0.46 per share of common stock (or pre-funded warrant). In addition, we issued and sold investor warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 32,608,698 shares at a strike price of $0.60 and are exercisable over the next five years. The Company, also in connection with the offering, issued placement agent warrants to purchase an aggregate of up 2,608,696 shares of common stock at a strike price of $0.575 per share. We received net proceeds of $17.8 million from the offering after deducting investor and other filing fees of $2.2 million.
On June 14, 2021, we issued and sold in a registered direct offering an aggregate of 29.0 million shares of our common stock and investor warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 29.0 million shares at a strike price of $1.725. The Company, also in connection with the direct offering, issued placement agent warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 1.7 million shares of our common stock at a strike price of $2.15625 per share. We received net proceeds of $45.8 million from the offering after deducting investor fees of $4.2 million.
On February 1, 2021, we closed a public offering and sold a total 28,700,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.50 per share, less the underwriter discounts and commissions. We received net proceeds of $40.5 million from the offering after deducting the underwriting discounts and commission of $4.0 million. 
The Company is projecting it will continue to generate significant negative operating cash flows over the next 12-months and beyond. In management's evaluation of the going concern conclusion we considered the following: i) continued COVID-19 uncertainties; ii) negative cash flows that are projected over the next 12-month period; iii) uncertainty regarding potential settlements related to ongoing litigation and regulatory investigations; iv) approximately $25.6 million of the total contingent consideration of $51.9 million are expected to become due to the former owners of Holo Surgical if certain milestones are met over the next 12 months which would be paid in cash; v) total payments of $10.3 million at fair value for INN related milestones that are expected to be paid in cash when the milestones are achieved in the future; vi) seller notes in the amount of $10.0 million a fair value due to the seller of INN on December 31, 2024; and vii) various supplier minimum purchase agreements. The Company’s operating plan for the next 12-month period also includes continued investments in its product pipeline including both within digital health and hardware and biologics, which will necessitate additional financing. In addition to these efforts the Company will need continued capital and cash flows to fund the future operations through 2022 and beyond. The Company’s ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, financial markets in the United States and worldwide. If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company’s on-going cash requirements through 2022, the Company will be required to scale back operations, reduce research and development expenses, and postpone, as well as suspend capital expenditures, in order to preserve liquidity. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 
In consideration of the inherent risks and uncertainties and the Company’s forecasted negative cash flows as described above, management has concluded that substantial doubt exists with respect to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. Management continually evaluates plans to raise additional debt and/or equity financing and will attempt to curtail discretionary expenditures in the future, if necessary, however, in consideration of the risks and uncertainties mentioned, such plans cannot be considered probable of occurring at this time.
The recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the Company’s accompanying consolidated balance sheets is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company’s ability to meet its funding requirements on a continuous basis, to maintain existing financing and to succeed in its future operations. The Company’s consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary, should the Company be unable to continue in existence.
Segments
The Company operates one reportable segment: Spine. 
Strategy
Our goal is to improve patient outcomes in Spine and adjacent specialties through the deployment of intelligent digital and surgical technologies across the continuum of care. To achieve our goal, we are pursuing the following strategies: 
•Leverage our digital surgery platform to improve patient outcomes 
We believe HOLO Portal™ is the world’s first AI driven augmented reality guidance system for spine and is the first clinical application of our HOLO™ AI platform. HOLO Portal™ guidance includes HOLO™ AI neural networks, which assists the surgeon by autonomously segmenting and labelling anatomic structures from an intraoperative 3D image, and automatically suggesting a patient specific surgical plan. The result is viewed by the surgeon through the AR display and is designed to help them quickly place instruments, accurately achieve surgical objectives, and reduce cognitive load. In parallel, we are working to expand the indications for HOLO™ AI, our portfolio of neural networks designed to analyze, segment, and measure medical images including diagnostic, intraoperative, and postoperative modalities. Our vision is to apply AI across the continuum of care to find what drives patient satisfaction, in spine as well as adjacent specialties. 
•Develop and commercialize an increased cadence of innovative spine implants and biomaterials products. We plan to leverage our current strengths and invest in our research and development platform, in order to expand our product portfolio and develop next-generation, clinically validated products. To support these efforts, we plan to hire additional dedicated engineers and scientists with expertise in product design and development. We plan to continue to deepen our relationships with thought-leading surgeons to develop clinically validated procedures and products that deliver better patient outcomes. We also plan to create seamless integration between our products, procedures, and our digital surgery platform.
•Validate our innovative products with clinical evidence. We have a history of investing in clinical efficacy and outcomes studies to validate our products with peer-reviewed clinical evidence. There are more than 100 peer-reviewed clinical publications spanning our portfolio, including the Coflex® device, HPS® 2.0 fixation and TETRAfuse® 3D technology. We are investing in building a larger research and clinical affairs team that will bolster our clinical evidence. We plan to gather real-world clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of our new innovative products. We plan to continue collaborating with our surgeon customers and key opinion leaders to share clinical data analyses through peer-reviewed scientific publications and conference presentations to the spine surgery and medical community. We believe such clinical data will bring increased awareness of our products and technologies and attract surgeon and patient interest.
•Grow our international business. We have strong commercial and research and development infrastructure outside the United States. We plan to focus our international commercial efforts on certain key markets that we believe represent a current annual market opportunity of $5.9 billion. We have a direct sales channel in several markets including Germany, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. We maintain a hybrid sales channel in other key markets throughout Europe and Asia where we plan to evaluate the potential for conversion to direct sales channels, in order to enhance our market penetration. To facilitate continued growth of our international business, we plan to introduce multiple new innovative products to our surgeon customers.
•Strategically pursue acquisition, license, and distribution opportunities. We have experience identifying acquisition, license, and distribution opportunities and integrating new technologies to complement our product portfolio specifically as it relates to our digital health strategy. We plan to strategically use these business development activities to supplement our internal innovations and fill key product portfolio needs.

Industry Overview
The global spine surgery industry can be broken into various markets that align with the treatment procedures for patients suffering from back-related pain and other conditions. The most prevalent markets are spine implants, composed of implantable devices to aid in both fusion and motion preservation procedures and the biomaterials market consisting of human-derived and synthetic bone growth substitute products. 
Enabling Technologies
A relatively new and emerging segment to the spine surgery market is enabling technologies. These technologies are designed to aid surgeons in the treatment of spinal conditions by providing information and tools to enhance treatment planning and execution. Major categories within this segment include surgical navigation systems, robotic targeting devices and pre-surgical planning software. 
Spine Implants
The global spine implants annual market opportunity was estimated at $8.8 billion in 2020, with most revenues being generated from spinal fusion devices. Fusion devices are designed and developed to aid in the restoration of spinal alignment and to provide fixation during the fusion process. Conversely, motion preservation devices are designed predominantly to stabilize the spine and allow for motion of the segments. Spine implants can be surgically applied via traditional open surgery or via minimally invasive surgery. We provide devices in both segments of the spine implant market and via both surgical methodologies.
Biomaterials
The global biomaterials annual market opportunity was estimated at $4.8 billion in 2020. The biomaterials segment covers a large range of bone growth substitutes, including growth factors, cellular allografts, Demineralized Bone Matrices ("DBMs"), traditional allografts, and synthetic bone graft substitutes. Biomaterials are utilized during spine surgery procedures to promote fusion by substituting or augmenting the normal regenerative capacity of bone. 
Our Products
On January 14, 2022 we received U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") clearance on HOLO Portal™, our AI-driven AR surgical navigation system for spine. This is the first of many FDA submission related to our digital health platform and strategy to improve patient outcomes. We have a broad portfolio of spine implants, including solutions for fusion procedures in the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spine, motion preservation solutions for the lumbar spine, and a minimally invasive surgical implant system for fusion of the sacroiliac joint. We also have a broad portfolio of biomaterial products.
Surgical Guidance
On January 14, 2022, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for HOLO Portal™, a surgical guidance system utilizing AR and AI for use in spine surgery. HOLO Portal™ surgical guidance incorporates HOLO™ AI technology with a unique AR interface to enhance intraoperative image-based navigation with AI driven insights. The system features intraoperative surgical planning that uses AI to automate manual and time-consuming tasks, such as anatomic labelling, implant sizing, and trajectory planning. The surgical plan is then presented to the surgeon through the augmented reality display.
Patented HOLO Portal™ software includes several convolutional neural networks to segment and group patient anatomy based on intraoperative CT scans. This results in a patient-specific 3D model that is automatically labeled with anatomic structures for use during surgery, including: pedicle, vertebral body, spinal canal, articular processes, transverse process, lamina, spinous process, ribs, pelvis.
HOLO Portal™ software suggests screw trajectories and measures pedicle sizes from the patient-specific 3D model. The system then suggests the appropriate screw size based on a surgeon-defined pedicle fill ratio. The resulting surgical plan is designed to maximize accuracy and eliminate time spent manually planning trajectories and measuring screw sizes.
Once the segmentation and screw plan is generated, HOLO Portal™ software displays the surgical plan intraoperatively through the interactive AR display and provides a 3D guidance overlay on the patient’s anatomy. 3D trajectory and targeting are superimposed on surgical instruments in real time within the surgical field. This innovative design may reduce the surgeon’s cognitive load by providing intuitive guidance that allows the surgeon to keep focus on the surgical field. We believe that HOLO Portal™ may help surgeons achieve better surgical outcomes, reduce complications, and improve patient satisfaction. 
We are developing additional applications utilizing HOLO™ AI technology for use in multiple clinical specialties across the patient continuum of care. We believe HOLO™ AI, our portfolio of neural network technologies, is one of the most advanced artificial intelligence technologies being applied to surgery.
Spine Implants
As of 2021, all of our revenues related to the spine implants portfolio are generated from spinal fusion devices and motion preservation devices. Fusion devices are designed and developed to aid in the restoration of spinal alignment and to provide fixation during the fusion process. Conversely, motion preservation devices are designed to stabilize the spine and allow for motion of the segments. Sacroiliac joint fusion implant systems are designed to relieve sacroiliac joint pain. We provide devices in each of these three segments of the spinal hardware implant market. 
Thoracolumbar and Cervical Spine Fusion Devices
We offer a broad portfolio of cervical, thoracic and lumbar interbody (e.g., Fortilink® cages with TETRAfuse® technology) and fixation (e.g., Streamline® MIS/Degen/OCT pedicle screws) devices for conventional spine fusion procedures including anterior cervical ciscectomy and fusion (ACDF), posterior cervical fusion (PCF), posterior lumbarinterbody fusion (PLIF), transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF), anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) and lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF).
Sacroiliac Joint Fusion Devices 
We are one of the market-leaders in the sacroiliac joint ("SI"), fusion segment of the spinal hardware implant market. Our SImmetry® system allows for minimally invasive SI joint fusion surgery that eliminates the movement of the joint in two ways:
1.True SI joint fusion – The surgeon decorticates the joint surfaces with special instruments, in accordance with orthopedic principles, to create the appropriate environment to fuse the joint.
2.Immediate fixation – By placing an implant across the joint, the joint is instantly immobilized, allowing fusion.
Two-year data from the EVoluSIon study showed high rates of joint fusion and statistically significant decreases in opioid use, pain, and disability scores, as well as the possibility of faster recovery times.
Motion Preservation Devices
Our motion preservation portfolio includes the Coflex® Interlaminar Stabilization device, the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") premarket approval application ("PMA") approved implant for the treatment of moderate to severe lumbar spinal stenosis in conjunction with direct decompression. The Coflex® device is the first and only posterior lumbar motion preservation solution with Level I evidence, the highest possible level of clinical data, from two prospective, randomized studies against two treatment options—decompression alone and decompression with fusion—across two countries, the United States and Germany. The Coflex® device has demonstrated long-term clinical outcomes for durable pain relief and stability. The device has been implanted in more than 163,000 patients worldwide. 
Biomaterials
We have a significant portfolio across the biomaterials market for spinal fusion procedures. Our portfolio of biomaterials includes products ranging from innovative tissue-based solutions to advanced synthetic bone graft substitutes for a range of surgical applications. Our biomaterials products complement our spine implants product line with the synergistic goal to improve fusion rates. 
Cellular Allograft
The ViBone® family of products, supplied by Aziyo Biologics, Inc. (“Aziyo”), is a next-generation viable cellular allograft bone matrix processed using a proprietary method optimized to protect and preserve the health of native bone cells to potentially enhance new bone formation.
Demineralized Bone Matrices (DBM)
DBM formulations are designed to provide naturally occurring bone proteins and other growth factors at varying stages of the bone healing process. We offer a broad DBM portfolio, which includes putty, strip, and boat configurations for various surgical applications to provide a natural scaffold for bone ingrowth and osteoinductive potential to facilitate fusion. Our flagship DBM is FibreX™ demineralized bone fibers, supplied by Origin Biologics.
Synthetic Bone Growth Substitutes 
Our synthetic bone growth substitutes portfolio, includes the nanOss® family of products, which provide osteoconductive nano-structured HA and an engineered extracellular matrix bioscaffold collagen carrier to provide a natural bone growth solution.
Research and Development
Since the launch of Surgalign in July 2020, we have focused on innovation, quality, and clinical validation in the design and development of our products. Instrumental to this focus is creating an R&D organization centralized in San Diego, California. This new center of excellence will continue to be supported by our capabilities in Wurmlingen, Germany. We have new capabilities in Poland, acquired through the Holo Surgical and INN transactions, that bring us expertise in AR, machine learning, and software development which will help us expand on our digital health strategy. We have also maintained our strategic partnership with RTI Surgical, subsequent to the disposition of our OEM Businesses, to support our spine implants and biomaterials businesses. 
Aligning Holo Surgical with our recent acquisition of equity in INN, we are committed to leading in digital health and expanding our scope outside the operating room and in additional clinical specialties. Our priorities include refinement and expansion of indications of our HOLO Portal™ system, and the development of a cloud platform to allow use of HOLO™ AI technology in preoperative and postoperative settings. This will enable us to leverage HOLO™ AI technology to automate certain use cases in diagnostics, preoperative planning, patient specific implants, and postoperative assessment, with an ultimate goal of predictive patient outcomes. 
Our short-term product development efforts will focus on initiatives to enhance our interbody cage offerings, fill focused gaps in our biomaterials portfolio and develop a new flagship posterior fixation system. We believe that doing so will allow us to better compete at the procedural level. We will also continue to work on developing differentiated technologies and generating the necessary clinical data to drive demand and support appropriate reimbursement. 
Intellectual Property
Our business depends upon the significant know-how and proprietary technology we have developed and curated. To protect this know-how and proprietary technology, we rely on a combination of trade secret laws, patents, licenses, trademarks, and confidentiality agreements. The intended effect of these intellectual property rights is to define zones of exclusive use of the covered intellectual property. The duration of patent rights generally is 20 years from the date of filing of priority application, while trademarks, once registered, generally have a term of 10 years but can be renewed so long as the trademarks continue to be used. Our trademarks and service marks provide our company and our products with a certain degree of brand recognition in our markets. However, we do not consider any single patent, trademark or service mark material to our business strategy, financial condition, or results of operations. Further, we have also entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. 
Our U.S. and foreign holdings include, without limitation, patents, patent applications and trade secrets relating to or covering certain synthetic bone graft substitutes; interbody fusion and motion implants; spinal and orthopedic plates; spinal rods, cables and screws and spinal fixation systems and related instrumentation. 
As part of the Holo Surgical Acquisition, we acquired intellectual property and technologies that relate to digital surgery. As of December 31, 2021, the intellectual property of the Holo Surgical business included, among other things, two issued U.S. patents, one granted European patent, fifteen U.S. pending patent applications, and ten pending European patent applications. We do not know whether our current patent applications, or any future patent applications that we may file, will result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, or at all, or whether any patents we may receive will be challenged or invalidated. The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a nonprovisional patent application in the applicable country. The expected years of expiration for these patents and any patents that issue from such pending applications range from 2037 to 2042. The HOLO™ platform is an autonomous anatomical mapping technology designed to assist surgeons and physicians to diagnose, treat, and manage patients with neurosurgical and orthopedic conditions. The HOLO™ platform is capable of advanced, real-time analytics, autonomous presurgical planning, and autonomous intraoperative guidance, potentially enhancing surgical performance with the goal of facilitating improved patient outcomes.
Further, as part of the acquisition of the equity interest in INN, we received a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to INN intellectual property and technologies. INN’s proprietary artificial intelligence technology and intercranial capabilities complement our HOLOTM platform technology.
The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. As the number of entrants into our market increases, the risk of an infringement claim against us, as well as the risk of a third party infringing on our patents, grows. While we attempt to ensure that our implants and methods do not infringe other parties’ patents and proprietary rights, our competitors or other third parties may assert that our implants, and the methods we employ, are covered by patents held by them. In addition, our competitors and other third parties may assert that future implants and methods we may employ infringe their patents. If third parties claim that we infringe upon, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling the affected implant. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We are currently, have been in the past, and may be in the future, involved in litigation relating to intellectual property. For more information regarding the risks related to intellectual property, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Sales and Distribution
We currently market and sell our products in the United States and in more than 50 countries globally. Our U.S. Commercial organization includes Professional Education, Corporate Accounts, and field-based Area Sales Directors and Regional Product Specialists supported by an extensive network of independent spine and biomaterial distributors. Our international sales organization consists of a direct sales force in several European countries and stocking distributors in the rest of the world.
We anticipate adding additional independent distributors and plan to invest in additional marketing and surgeon education & training to support this expansion. We believe the expansion of our U.S. and international sales efforts will provide us with significant opportunity for future growth as we launch our digital technology platform, expand our product portfolio, and seek to penetrate existing and new markets.
In January 2022 we started to hire for our capital sales team which will be solely focused on sales and placement of the HOLO Portal™ system with our strategy partners.
Surgeon Education and Training 
We devote significant resources to educate surgeons on the proper use of our technologies and techniques including the HOLO Portal™ system. The successful use of our products and technologies depends, in part, on the training and skills of the surgeon performing the procedure. We are developing a state-of-the-art cadaver operating theater and training facility in our San Diego Innovation Center, to help drive adoption of our products. 
We believe our success is partially dependent on our ability to differentiate, with clinically validated products and procedures, the quality of our products and reputation within the spine surgeon community. We have a strong commitment to conducting collaborative research with surgeons and we intend to continue working with surgeons and other healthcare professionals in clinical research to further advance our pipeline of novel, innovative technology, and product offerings.
International Operation
Internationally, we market and distribute our implants through a direct distribution organization and a network of independent distributors. International revenues accounted for approximately 14% of our 2021 global revenues. 
Our international business is based in Wurmlingen, Germany. With our presence in the region, we can rely on the large local network of spine manufacturers and the wider “Medical Valley Community” of spine and medical device experts and talent. Our international warehousing and logistics have been outsourced to a qualified third-party logistics provider based in the Netherlands that has scalable biomaterials and hardware capabilities and operations. We received MDR certification in the EU in October 2020, which will provide us opportunities for future expansion. 
A significant addition to our international presence is the acquisition of Holo Surgical and INN personnel in Poland which will allow us to harness new capabilities in digital surgery with artificial intelligence and predictive analytics. 
Competition
Competition in the medical implant industry is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. Companies within the industry compete based on design of related instrumentation, efficacy of implants, service and relationships with the surgical community, depth of range of implants, scientific and clinical results, and pricing. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, with much greater resources. In some cases, our customers compete with us in multiple product categories.
We consider our principal competitors in the spine implant and biomaterials, and digital health markets to include Medtronic, Zimmer, plc. DePuy Synthes NuVasive, Inc., Stryker Corporation, Global Medical, Inc., Alphatec Holdings Inc., SeaSpine Holdings Corporation, and Orthofix Medical Inc. 
Government Regulation and Corporate Compliance
Government Regulation
Government regulation plays a significant role in the design and distribution of allograft tissue implants and medical devices. We procure, where applicable and market our allograft tissue implants and medical devices worldwide. Although some standardization exists, each country in which we do business has its own specific regulatory requirements. 
These requirements are dynamic in nature and, as such, are continually changing. New regulations may be promulgated at any time and with limited notice. While we believe that we are in material compliance with all existing pertinent international and domestic laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in governmental administrations and regulations, or their interpretation or application, will not adversely affect our operations. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production, inability to market current products, criminal prosecution, and/or refusal of the government to authorize the marketing of new products.
We currently market and distribute allograft implants that are processed from human tissue, which are processed by third-party suppliers who are responsible for satisfying local regulatory requirements and who ship the implants directly to our customers. We believe that worldwide regulation of allografts is likely to intensify as the international regulatory community focuses on the growing demand for these implants and the attendant safety and efficacy issues of citizen recipients. 
Our research, development, and clinical programs, as well as our marketing and commercial operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our implants distributed in the United States are subject to the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The regulations that cover our implants and facilities vary widely based on implant type and classification both in the United States, and from country to country. The amount of time required to obtain approvals or clearances from regulatory authorities also differs from country to country. 
Unless an exemption applies, most of the medical devices that we commercially distribute in the United States are covered by premarket notification (“510(k)”) clearance from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II. Manufacturers of most Class II medical devices are required to obtain 510(k) clearance prior to marketing their devices. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use and in technological and performance characteristics to another legally marketed 510(k)-cleared “predicate device.” By regulation, the FDA’s performance goals are to clear or deny a 510(k) premarket notification within 90 FDA review days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance may take longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a lengthy premarket approval application (“PMA”) process. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval through the PMA process. 
Class III medical devices are required to undergo the PMA approval process in which the manufacturer must establish the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will typically conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations (21 CFR Part 820) (“QSR”). FDA reviews of PMA applications generally can take between one and three years, or longer. We have one FDA PMA approved device: The Coflex® Interlaminar Stabilization device. The Coflex® device is currently the only FDA PMA-approved implant for the treatment of moderate to severe lumbar spinal stenosis in conjunction with decompression. 
The medical devices that we develop, manufacture, distribute, and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. The process of obtaining FDA clearance and other regulatory approvals to develop and market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. While we believe that we have obtained, or will be able to obtain, all necessary clearances and approvals for the manufacture and sale of our implants and that they are, or will be, in material compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue such compliance. After an implant is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Those regulatory requirements may include, as applicable: product listing and establishment registration; QSRs, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; labeling regulations (including unique device identification (“UDI”) requirements), and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved, or off-label uses or indications; clearance of 
product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and notices of corrections or removals.
We and certain of our suppliers also are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with FDA’s QSR and other regulations. If the FDA were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations, the agency could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public Warning Letter to more severe sanctions, such as: fines and civil penalties against us, our officers, our employees or our suppliers; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products; withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; product recall or seizure; interruption of production; operating restrictions; injunctions; and criminal prosecution. Moreover, governmental authorities outside the United States have become increasingly stringent in their regulation of medical devices, and our products may become subject to more rigorous regulation by non-U.S. governmental authorities in the future. U.S. or non-U.S. government regulations may be imposed in the future that may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. The EU has nationally transposed regulations based on the European Commission (“EC”) Medical Device Directives (“MDD”) for the control of medical devices with which manufacturers must comply. New Medical Device Regulations (“MDR”) were slated to replace the medical device directives effective May 26, 2020, in the EU. However, due to delays, implementation of the EU MDR began on May 26, 2021. Manufacturers must have received Conformitè Europèene (“CE”) certification from a “notified body” to be able to sell products within the member states of the EU. Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a CE mark. Products covered by the EC directives that do not bear the CE mark cannot be sold or distributed within the EU. All products that we distribute in the EU have received CE certification. 
All medical devices currently distributed in the EU under MDD are likely impacted by the implementation of MDR. MDR may also include products, such as human tissue, not traditionally considered medical devices in the EU. Additionally, MDR, among other things, increases regulatory requirements for several medical device groupings applicable to our implants distributed in the EU, including strengthening notified body oversight for Class I reusable surgical instruments, and up-classifying spinal devices in contact with the spinal column. We received MDR certification in October 2020 and again in October 2021.
Our products may be reimbursed by third-party payers, such as government programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare or private insurance plans and healthcare networks. Third-party payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device provided to a patient or used in a procedure does not meet applicable payment criteria or if the policy holder’s healthcare insurance benefits are limited. Also, third-party payers may challenge the medical necessity and prices paid for our products and services.
The False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, as well as state and international anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation, regulate the conduct of medical device companies’ interactions with the healthcare industry. Among other things, these laws and others generally: (1) prohibit the provision of anything of value in exchange for the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any item or service reimbursed by a federal healthcare program, (including Medicare and Medicaid); (2) require that claims for payment submitted to federal healthcare programs be truthful; and (3) prohibit inappropriate payment to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We maintain a compliance program that incorporates the seven fundamental elements as set forth by the Office of the Inspector General within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This facilitates our compliance with requirements regarding the prohibition of inappropriate transfers of value in exchange for referrals or obtaining or retaining foreign business engagements, prohibition regarding the submission of inappropriate claims for reimbursement to federal healthcare programs, as well as generally ensuring ethical interactions with the healthcare industry both domestically and internationally.
Under Section 6002 of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act) and similar state and international transparency reporting legislation, we are required to collect and report data regarding payments or other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and other persons in the healthcare industry. Our compliance program ensures all such payments and transfers of value are appropriate per the requirements of 
applicable anti-bribery or anti-corruption legislation and that all required data is reported to relevant U.S. and International governmental entities as called for by applicable transparency reporting legislation. 
In addition, U.S. federal, state, and international laws protect the confidentiality of certain health and other personal information, in particular individually identifiable information such as medical records and other protected health information (“PHI”), and restrict the use and disclosure of such information. In administering our employee health plan, we comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). In our dealing with customers such as health care providers or hospitals, we are not a Covered Entity or Business Associate as defined by the HIPAA Privacy Rule, but we voluntarily incorporate applicable HIPAA standards in our corporate policies regarding handling of PHI we receive. We are also subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act. At the international level, the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) (“GDPR”) applies to our processing of personal data of EU residents. This law regulates and protects the collection, use, processing, and disclosure of personal information, including by imposing privacy and security requirements and penalties for violations. We comply with this regulation for both general personal data as well as the higher sensitivity standards for health and financial data and are implementing the standards of this regulation as part of our corporate policy for processing personal data from all U.S. and international jurisdictions. 
Corporate Compliance
We have a comprehensive compliance program. It is a fundamental policy of our company to conduct business in accordance with the highest ethical and legal standards. Our corporate compliance and ethics program is designed to promote legal compliance and ethical business practices throughout our domestic and international businesses. 
Our compliance program is designed to substantially meet the U.S. Sentencing Commission’s guidelines for effective organizational compliance and ethics programs and to detect and prevent violations of applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Our compliance program is global in nature; designed and operationalized to ensure compliance with relevant international laws and multi-jurisdictional legislation, including, but not limited to: OFAC, FCPA, UK Bribery Act, Modern Slavery, HIPAA and GDPR. 
Key elements of our compliance program include:
•Organizational oversight by senior-level personnel responsible for the compliance functions within our company; 
•Written standards and procedures, including a Code of Conduct; 
•Methods for communicating compliance concerns, including anonymous reporting mechanisms; 
•Investigation and remediation measures to ensure prompt response to reported matters and timely corrective action; 
•Compliance education and training for employees and contracted business associates such as distributors; 
•Auditing and monitoring controls to promote compliance with applicable laws and assess program effectiveness; 
•Oversight of interactions with healthcare professionals to ensure compliance with healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including mandated reporting of transfers of value to healthcare professionals under the Affordable Care Act; 
•Oversight of corporate handling of personal data to ensure compliance with data protection legislation; 
•Disciplinary guidelines to enforce compliance and address violations; 
•Screening of employees and relevant contracted business associates; and 
•Risk assessments to identify areas of regulatory compliance risk. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 231 employees of which 70 were employed outside of the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. We believe a strong employee culture and a commitment to improving patient lives by advancing the standard of spine care and our digital health initiatives will help foster a shared sense of engagement and purpose among our employees and provide us with a competitive advantage. Our culture and employees are driven by our five values: being relentless, gritty and tenacious; acting with speed; being customer-focused and patient-minded; leading with integrity; and being bold and acting courageously. We intend to attract and retain the best talent in the industry by offering competitive pay, annual incentive 
awards, equity opportunities, health, wellness and retirement benefits, and a work environment that enables our employees to fully utilize their potential and deliver long-term stockholder value. We also believe having a diverse workforce, including diversity of personal characteristics and experience, is important for us to succeed as we transform our legacy business into Surgalign: a leading medical technology company focused on elevating the standard of care through the evolution of digital health.
Seasonality
Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopedic implant surgeries and elective procedures generally declines during the summer months and increases in the fourth quarter.
