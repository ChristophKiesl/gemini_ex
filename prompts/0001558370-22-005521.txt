Overview
Redbox is an established brand and leading provider in the home entertainment market in the United States. The Company is focused on providing its customers with the best value in entertainment and the most choice in how they consume it, through physical media and/or digital services. Redbox is undergoing a significant business expansion and digital transformation. The Company has transitioned from a pure-play DVD rental company to a multi-faceted entertainment company that provides tremendous value and choice by offering DVD rentals as well as multiple digital products across a variety of content windows including transactional (TVOD), ad-supported (AVOD/FLTV) and being a distributor of original feature films with a growing library of content. Redbox currently conducts its business through two operating segments: (1) Legacy Business and (2) Digital Business.
For its Legacy Business, the Company operates a nationwide network of approximately 38,000 self-service kiosks where consumers can rent or purchase new-release DVDs and Blu-ray DiscsTM (“movies”). The Company also generates service revenue by providing installation, merchandising and break-fix services to other kiosk businesses. Finally, the Company acquires, and distributes movies exclusively through its film distribution label, Redbox Entertainment, LLC, acquiring rights to talent-led films that are distributed across Redbox platforms as well as through third party digital services. For its Digital Business, the Company provides both transactional and ad-supported digital streaming services, which include 1) Redbox On Demand, a transactional service which provides digital rental or purchase of new release and catalog movies and TV content, 2) Redbox Free On Demand (AVOD), an ad-supported service providing free movies and TV shows on demand, and 3) Redbox Free Live TV (FLTV), a free, ad-supported television service giving access to over 130 linear channels. The Company also sells third-party display advertising via its mobile app, website, and e-mails, as well as display and video advertising at the kiosk.
Redbox Legacy Business
Redbox’s mission has always been to make it ridiculously cheap and easy for customers to get the home entertainment they want. Redbox provides exceptional customer value with new release movie disc rentals priced at approximately $2.00 a night, about one-third of the cost of a digital rental, which are typically $5.99 or more on digital retail platforms. Customers have the flexibility to rent a movie from one location and return their rental to any kiosk. Kiosks are located primarily at grocery stores, mass retailers, drug stores, dollar retailers, and convenience stores. With approximately 33,000 locations and more than 150 retail partners, consumers have convenient access to kiosks as part of their routine shopping experiences. Revenue is generated primarily through the fees charged to rent or purchase a movie, and Redbox pays retailers a percentage of the revenue generated at the Redbox kiosks installed at their locations. The Company obtains content through revenue sharing agreements and license agreements with major studios as well as through direct purchases from independent distributors and other suppliers.
Redbox has built a unique asset in its loyalty and rewards program, Redbox Perks, which currently boasts 40 million members. Customers earn points for their rentals or purchases and can use those points for free rentals in the future. This tiered loyalty program gives the Company the ability to reward its most loyal and valuable customers while providing a currency for incenting increased transaction frequency and other behaviors, such as downloading the Redbox app or trying new products and services. Redbox Perks is a vehicle to provide greater value to value-conscious customers and is central to its marketing and customer strategy. The program is a differentiator in the market and a competitive advantage for Redbox. Redbox’s customers are value-conscious, love movies and entertainment, and tend to be late-adopters of new technology. Given the scale of the existing customer base, the Company has built a 

4



sizable marketing program that includes approximately 45 million e-mail subscribers, approximately 5 million SMS subscribers, approximately 45 million mobile app downloads, and an estimated 375 million weekly impressions at retail. 
To drive further engagement with our customers, Redbox established Redbox Entertainment, LLC as a movie distribution label. Through this label, the Company acquires North American rights and distributes feature films through Redbox kiosks, Redbox On Demand, third party digital transactional platforms and other streaming services. Redbox Entertainment acquires rights to finished films and also commits to slate deals for movies to be produced, giving the Company input on scripts and/or talent. The Company generates meaningful gross profit from these films through promotional initiatives on its own platform, transactional revenue on third-party digital platforms and selling downstream window rights to subscription streaming services. Because the Company is acquiring long term exclusive rights to these films, Redbox is building a content library which can be programmed on its Free On Demand (AVOD) and Free Live TV (FLTV) services or further licensed to other streaming platforms in future windows.
In addition, Redbox Entertainment benefits from the Company’s robust rental data and insights into what titles and talent will perform. The Company has released a number of films since 2019 under the Redbox Entertainment label. The Company has already announced a slate deal with John Wick-producer, Basil Iwanyk, committing to 12 action/ thriller films over the next several years.
Finally, Redbox has a service business, which employs a team of best-in-class field workers nationwide to manage kiosk installation, merchandising and break-fix services. In addition to maintaining Redbox’s kiosk network, the Company’s service team also supports other kiosk businesses. The Company has service agreements with multiple companies that have national and regional kiosk networks and since June of 2020, Redbox has been the primary vendor for Amazon, servicing their expanding Amazon locker business. The service business helps mitigate the operational costs of the field operations for the Legacy DVD business while generating incremental margin dollars.
Redbox Digital Business
Redbox is rapidly expanding its digital product offering, leveraging its customer and marketing scale to transform the brand. The Company is building a digital ecosystem that consumers can use as a one-stop shop for their entertainment needs by engaging with a variety of digital video services within the Redbox app in an integrated, easy-to-use format. This simplifies the customer experience, drives multi-product adoption, and minimizes customer churn. These services span multiple business models including transactional, ad-supported, and in the future, subscription. The Company’s digital products are available to stream across web browsers, mobile devices, and almost every major consumer device, including Roku, Apple TV, Samsung, LG, Android TV, VIZIO, Xbox and PlayStation.
In December 2017, the Company launched Redbox On Demand, a digital transactional video-on-demand service (TVOD), allowing customers to rent or buy new release and catalog digital movies and television episodes, with new release prices typically ranging from $5.99 to $24.99 and catalog movies from $1.99 to $16.99, not including any discounts. Since 2020, customers have also been able to digitally rent movies that are still in theaters, which is now known as Premium Video-On-Demand service (PVOD). Customers pay a transactional fee to rent or buy content while earning Redbox Perks loyalty points every time they transact. Redbox On Demand has seen rapid growth and adoption with almost 4 million customers. That growth has been fueled primarily through leveraging the Company’s own marketing channels including e-mail and SMS and offering rewards points or promos to drive digital customer acquisition.
In February 2020, the Company launched Redbox Free Live TV (FLTV), an ad-supported digital linear television service, as a complement to the existing transactional On Demand service. With over 130 linear channels and growing, including five Redbox-branded and programmed channels, Free Live TV gives customers the opportunity to channel surf and find content that interests them. In addition, the Redbox-branded channels, which are programmed by the Company, are also currently syndicated to the third-party Free Ad-Supported TV (“FAST”) Channel services, including the Roku Channel, LG Channels and Vizio Watchfree, which serves to drive greater viewership and revenue. 
Redbox also launched an ad-supported Free On Demand service (AVOD) in December 2020. AVOD gives consumers complete control over when they watch and with the growth of Redbox’s AVOD library, which is approximately 8,000 movies and TV episodes, consumers have a broad amount of content to choose from. The ad-supported services (FLTV and AVOD) have seen strong growth in engagement as new titles are added and awareness of the offering grows.
Finally, Redbox operates a media advertising business which monetizes monthly display and video ad impressions across its streaming and mobile app, web, e-mail and kiosk network. The Company drives advertising revenue through a mix of programmatic 

5



advertising and direct sales. Direct ad sales for the media above as well as video advertising for Free On Demand and FLTV are driven by an internal sales team and a strategic sales partnership with Screenvision and the Palomino Media Group.
Redbox Competitive Strengths
The Company believes the business is driven by the following competitive differentiators:

1. | Established brand in home entertainment. With over 6 billion movies rented over last 19 years, Redbox is a well-known and established brand in the entertainment space. Redbox has a large and highly differentiated customer base of value-conscious customers, many of whom are late-adopters of new technology. This creates a unique opportunity to carve out a differentiated market positioning to attract and retain customers as they adopt digital entertainment options.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Attractive value for new release movies. At approximately $2.00 a night for a new release disc movie rental, Redbox provides one of the best values in entertainment, especially when compared to the typical price of $5.99 for a digital rental of the same title. This is a clear differentiator, especially for value conscious consumers. Customers are usually able to access these movies 60 to 120 days before they become available on subscription streaming platforms which require monthly subscription fees ranging from $5.00 to $20.00 a month depending on the provider.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Unique, Loyal and Differentiated Customer Base. As a result of the price point and retail distribution channels, Redbox has attracted a unique customer base. Over 70% of the Company’s customers self-identify as “deal hunters,” and Redbox customers have been slower to fully transition to digital. Approximately 70% of the customer base identifies as later adopters of technology and over-indexes on traditional cable TV spend. This unique customer base provides Redbox a great opportunity to tailor its digital products to serve their specific needs as they make a shift to digital over time.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Robust Redbox Perks Program Drives Loyalty and Product Sampling. The Redbox Perks program allows the Company to reward value-conscious customers with benefits earned through loyalty points every time they transact. Those points can then be redeemed for free or discounted rentals in the future, driving greater loyalty and engagement. With 40 million members, the Redbox Perks program is truly unique in its offering and scale and becomes a competitive advantage when driving new customer adoption of digital services and minimizing customer churn. The Perks points not only incentivize users to create log-in credentials and opt-in to marketing communications, but they can also be used to encourage further customer engagement such as increased transactional frequency, downloading the mobile app, or trialing new digital services such as Redbox FLTV or Redbox On Demand.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Marketing Scale and Expansive Geographic Reach Helps Drive Physical to Digital Conversion. Redbox has made significant investments in marketing initiatives including Redbox Perks, data analytics and customer relationship management (CRM). With approximately 45 million e-mail subscribers, approximately 5 million SMS subscribers and deep customer transactional and behavioral data, Redbox has a distinct advantage in driving new digital customers at minimal cost while simultaneously reinforcing the physical business. With the introduction of multiple new digital products in 2020, the Company is leveraging its kiosk network to drive awareness and trial of its digital services. The Company’s kiosks provide an expansive marketing platform through an estimated 375 million weekly impressions in retail.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Multiple Revenue Streams to Support Future Growth. In addition to the revenue that is generated through both rentals and sales of movies at its kiosks, the Company has created multiple complementary revenue streams to drive future growth (TVOD, FLTV, AVOD, Redbox Entertainment, service business, and digital media and advertising). These diversified revenue streams not only create a larger total addressable market, but also help to de-risk investment in the Company, as successes in any one business are reinforcing and additive to the other businesses. This enables Redbox’s continued growth and allows for greater flexibility to drive more customers, create market leverage, or reduce costs.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | Built-in distribution for Redbox Entertainment titles allow the Company to secure and profitably release titles. Redbox is able to profitably acquire titles through its Redbox Entertainment label given the built in distribution that exists through the kiosk and digital businesses. With a deep understanding of customer movie preferences, Redbox is able to acquire titles that the Company believes will perform well, generating incremental revenue at the kiosk. In addition, Redbox is able to broadly release titles across Redbox digital platforms concurrently and with the revenue generated from built-in physical and digital distribution, Redbox can efficiently recoup the upfront fees for long-term distribution rights. Subsequently, the Company can license those titles to other streaming partners downstream in transactional or subscription streaming windows to drive greater revenue and profits.

8. | Best-in-class service team provides additional growth opportunities. Because of the scale and efficiency required to service approximately 38,000 kiosks across 33,000 retail locations, Redbox has developed a large, national, best-in-class service team. With such a strong operations team, the Company can more efficiently and cost effectively install, merchandise, and service other kiosk-based, automated retailers than those companies can themselves. In addition to creating a new avenue for revenue growth, the service business helps reduce operational and overhead costs required for servicing Redbox as we realize efficiencies of scale.

Market Opportunity
The growth of streaming services has disrupted the traditional television distribution industry with a growing number of consumers “cutting the cord” and abandoning their traditional cable subscriptions. This disruption in the market and change in consumer behavior serve as tailwinds for Redbox’s digital transformation as more late adopters, who most resemble Redbox customers, cut the cord. As consumers leave the traditional pay television ecosystem, many are replacing those content services by accessing multiple other services requiring more apps, more passwords, and more billing information, which creates complexity and confusion for consumers. By providing Redbox customers with a single app offering a wide variety of entertainment choices, Redbox can provide consumers with a one-stop shop across multiple content services that we believe will simplify the customer experience, minimize customer churn, and drive higher average revenue.
In addition to the large consumer shift in cord cutting, the Company’s introduction of multiple new digital products has expanded its total addressable market. With Redbox’s On Demand service, the Company is also competing in a $4.7 billion market today according to SNL Kagan. And with the expansion into AVOD and SVOD channels, Redbox projects an even larger growth opportunity, per SNL Kagan, with a current combined total addressable market of $53 billion in the US, representing 24% growth from 2020 to 2021. With a combined total addressable market of approximately $58 billion, we believe Redbox is well positioned for growth given its established brand, customer base, and marketing assets and scale. 
Growth Strategy 
Redbox’s transformation into a multi-faceted entertainment company creates multiple areas for future growth. The Company’s expansion into AVOD and our intended eventual expansion into subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) will allow Redbox to participate in a very large and rapidly growing market. The Company is well positioned for long-term value creation through its focus on:
Growing multi-product customers. Redbox expects to grow multi-product customers through increasing customer acquisition marketing and spend across streaming device partners, marketing at the kiosk, and other external paid media. The Company has relied primarily on internal e-mail and SMS channels to drive customer acquisition. Thus, increased spend and attention via these additional channels with more content and services offered, will drive greater customer growth. Redbox will also continue to invest in driving multi-product customer adoption through improved CRM, greater personalization and targeted use of promotions to create more personalized customer funnels to encourage users to trial and adopt other digital services within the Redbox app.
Accelerating AVOD adoption. Redbox projects growth for the Company’s ad-supported service through measured investment to expand the Free Live TV and Free On Demand content offerings. Through increased content volume, the Company expects to drive higher engagement and more hours watched per customer. Further, this improved content is expected to drive an increase in customers, accelerating the business while maintaining a reasonable customer acquisition cost.
Ramping Content Acquisition. Redbox Entertainment drives additional revenue in two ways. First, it provides more content for the kiosk, On Demand and ad-supported offerings and second, it generates revenue from distributing and licensing to other streaming platforms. Redbox expects to ramp the number of releases to 36 per year over time. The number of releases will naturally ramp as committed titles complete production and are delivered and the pipeline continues to grow.
 Launching SVOD channels platform. As part of its long-term growth strategy, the Company also intends to develop a subscription channels product (SVOD channels), which would give consumers the opportunity to subscribe to multiple third-party premium SVOD channels through the Redbox app. Premium SVOD channels would be merchandised alongside the new release transactional content and free ad-supported content. Redbox would simplify the sign in, content discovery, and billing process for customers by providing an integrated solution through the Redbox app. Further, the Company intends to provide additional value to its customers through bundled offers with loyalty points and/or promotions for discounts at the kiosk to drive customer acquisition and retention.

Business Combination
On October 22, 2021, Redbox consummated the Business Combination. In connection with the Business Combination, the Company issued 32,770,000 shares of Class B common stock to Redwood Holdco, which have no economic rights, but entitle the holders thereof to one vote per issued share and may be exchanged on a one-for-one basis with Redwood Intermediate common units held by such holders for Class A common stock from time to time, subject to certain restrictions set forth in the Redwood Intermediate Limited Liability Company Agreement (such a surrender and exchange, an “Exchange”). Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company issued an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of Class A common stock to certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”) for a purchase price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $50 million. In addition, immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,995,989 shares of Class A common stock to certain investors (the “Backstop Subscribers”) for a purchase price of $10.10 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $20.2 million.
The result of the transaction transformed the Company into a publicly traded entity on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “RDBX”.
Following the closing of the Business Combination, Redwood Holdco controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:

● | the requirement that a majority of our board of directors consist of “independent directors” as defined under the rules of Nasdaq;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We intend to utilize these exemptions as long as we remain a controlled company.

Business Update, Going Concern and Strategic Alternatives
 Historically, rentals have been correlated with the number and quality of new theatrical titles released in a quarter. During 2021, Redbox’s business was negatively impacted by the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in fewer than expected theatrical releases. In addition, the significant increase in impacts from the Omicron variant caused further disruption to the business. As such, Redbox rentals have not recovered to the extent expected and, notwithstanding the year-over-year increase in new releases, were lower than the fourth quarter of 2020. As part of an effort to expand its business and transform into a multi-faceted entertainment company, during the fourth quarter of 2021 and into 2022, Redbox increased its marketing and on-demand expenditures. Costs also increased as Redbox purchased more content, which were not offset by an increase in revenues. 
 On January 28, 2022, Redbox borrowed the remaining availability under its revolving credit facility. During 2022, management has been actively taking steps to decrease monthly costs, delay capital expenditures, and increase revenues. On April 1, 2022, the Company announced a reduction in force of 150 employees completed on March 29, 2022. The Company estimates that the workforce reduction will decrease its annual operating costs by approximately $13.1 million, and that it will incur one-time restructuring charges of approximately $3.8 million, the substantial amount of which will be related to severance.
​
Redbox has been exploring a number of potential strategic alternatives with respect to the Company’s corporate or capital structure and seeking financing to fund operations and one-time restructuring costs. The Company’s Board of Directors established a Strategic Review Committee to, among other things, consider and oversee strategic alternatives or transactions that may be available to the Company with respect to its corporate or capital structure. Redbox has also announced a series of restructuring actions and initiatives to improve its efficiency and reduce its cost structure, including, but not limited to, (i) optimizing its kiosk network and (ii) 

8



initiating a workforce reduction across its supply chain and corporate teams. However, the risks and uncertainties related to the ongoing adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operating results, together with the Company’s recurring operating losses, accumulated deficit and negative working capital, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1: Business Update, Going Concern and Strategic Alternatives in Redbox’s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 If the Company is unable to implement one or more of the strategic alternatives currently under consideration, it could continue to experience adverse pressures on its relationships with counterparties who are critical to its business, its ability to access the capital markets, its ability to execute on its operational and strategic goals and its business, prospects, results of operations and liquidity generally. There can be no assurance as to when or whether the Company will implement any action as a result of these strategic initiatives, whether the implementation of one or more such actions will be successful, or the effects the failure to take action may have on the Company’s business, its ability to achieve its operational and strategic goals or its ability to finance its business or refinance its indebtedness. A failure to address these matters, in the near-term will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, prospects, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and its ability to service or refinance its corporate debt as it becomes due.
Competition
Redbox’s business has experienced an increase in competition from new and existing competitors. Redbox competes for the time and attention of its users across different forms of media, including physical media retailers, traditional broadcast, cable, satellite and internet-delivered video, multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), over the top (“OTT”) media services and providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, other providers of in-home and mobile entertainment such as radio, music streaming services, and social media and networking websites. Redbox further competes for the acquisition of film properties and their distribution by other companies. Many consumers maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple in-home entertainment providers and can easily shift time and spend from one provider to another.
Redbox competes to attract, engage, and retain users based on a number of factors, including the user experience, content range and quality, ease of use of Redbox’s platform, price, accessibility, perceptions of advertising load, brand awareness and reputation.
Many of Redbox’s competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater brand recognition, legacy operating histories and larger marketing and content budgets, as well as greater financial, technical, human and other resources.
Seasonality
Absent the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, Redbox has generally experienced seasonality in its rentals and revenue. Historically, greater demand over the holiday season typically results in higher rentals November through January. April has usually been a low rental month due, in part, to retail release timing in connection with the Academy Awards that historically has provided stronger content and resulted in higher rentals in March. September and October have been low rental months due, in part, to the beginning of the school year and the introduction of the new fall television season. Significant recurring events, such as the Olympics, also have a negative impact on rentals as they compete with customer viewing interest for movie content and affect retail release timing, which aims to avoid such events. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, our typical seasonal patterns.
Human Capital Management
The company believes that its employees, and their continued good health, financial security, and peace of mind, are vital to the company’s success. The company offers competitive compensation and high-quality benefit programs that allow employees to choose the options that best fit their needs and those of their families. The company also maintains a recognition program that provides managers several options to recognize both their teams and individual contributions. 
To help protect its workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company generally follows CDC Community Level Guidance, the requirements of state and local authorities, and any restrictions in place when employees enter the facility of a retail or other partner. In June 2020, the Company launched “Redbox United” as a way to support communities, and to address systemic racism through action and education.

As of December 31, 2021, Redbox had 1,408 employees. Included in this total were 1,031 field service employees throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico, who service Redbox’s kiosks. On April 1, 2022, the Company announced a reduction in force of 150 employees completed on March 29, 2022.
