Item 1. | Business

Introduction
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. is a leading mining and natural resources company. Founded in 1847, we are recognized as the largest and oldest independent iron ore mining company in the United States. We are a major supplier of iron ore pellets to the North American steel industry from our mines and pellet plants located in Michigan and Minnesota. Additionally, we operate an iron ore mining complex in Western Australia. Driven by the core values of safety, social, environmental and capital stewardship, our employees endeavor to provide all stakeholders with operating and financial transparency.
We are organized through a global commercial group responsible for sales and delivery of our products and operations groups responsible for the production of the iron ore that we market. Our continuing operations are organized according to geographic location: U.S. Iron Ore and Asia Pacific Iron Ore.
In the U.S., we currently own or co-own four operational iron ore mines plus one indefinitely idled mine. We are currently operating one iron ore mine in Michigan and three iron ore mines in Minnesota. All four mines are currently operating at or near full capacity. The Empire mine located in Michigan was indefinitely idled beginning on August 3, 2016. We plan to continue shipping Empire's remaining inventory of pellets into 2017. Our Asia Pacific operations consist solely of our Koolyanobbing iron ore mining complex in Western Australia, which is currently operating at or near full capacity. 
We are Focused on our Core U.S. Iron Ore Business 
We are the market-leading iron ore producer in the U.S., supplying differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to the largest North American steel producers. We have the unique advantage of being a low cost producer of iron ore pellets in the U.S. market with significant transportation and logistics advantages to serve the U.S. steel market effectively. Pricing structures contained in and the long-term supply nature of our existing contracts, along with our low-cost operating profile, position our U.S. Iron Ore business segment as a strong cash flow generator in most commodity pricing environments. Since instituting our core strategy of focusing on this business, we have achieved significant accomplishments including providing volume certainty by signing a new, ten-year supply agreement with our largest customer, substantially reducing operating costs by making various operational improvements, and developing alternate iron unit strategies to provide opportunities to enter into the EAF steel production market.
As the implementation of this strategy has strengthened the business, we have put additional emphasis on the continued improvement of our balance sheet via reduction of long-term debt. Since the 2014 initiation of our transition strategy, we have reduced the principal of our long-term debt by 21% using various liability management strategies. Given the cyclical nature of our business, we feel that further reduction of our long-term debt will improve the strength of our balance sheet and provide us increased financial flexibility to enable us to manage through any commodity environment, and we continue to seek the best opportunities to accomplish this.

U.S. Iron Ore 
We are a major producer of iron ore pellets, primarily selling production from U.S. Iron Ore to integrated steel companies in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. We operate four iron ore mines located in Michigan and Minnesota. In Michigan, we are operating the Tilden mine. In Minnesota, we are operating the Northshore, United Taconite and Hibbing mines. The Empire mine located in Michigan, which historically had annual rated capacity of 5.5 million long tons, was indefinitely idled beginning on August 3, 2016. The U.S.-based mines currently have an annual rated capacity of 27.4 million long tons of iron ore pellet production, representing 55% of total U.S. pellet production capacity. Based on our equity ownership in these mines, our share of the annual rated production capacity is currently 20.0 million long tons, representing 40% of total U.S. annual pellet capacity.
The following chart summarizes the estimated annual pellet production capacity and percentage of total U.S. pellet production capacity for each of the respective iron ore producers as of December 31, 2016:

Total U.S. mines | 49.9 | | 100.0 | %
1 Tons are long tons (2,240 pounds) 
2 Empire mine was excluded from the estimated capacity calculation as it is indefinitely idled

Our U.S. Iron Ore production generally is sold pursuant to long-term supply agreements with various price adjustment provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we produced a total of 23.4 million long tons of iron ore pellets, including 2.8 million long tons from our indefinitely-idled Empire mine. The 2016 U.S. Iron Ore production includes 16.0 million long tons for our account and 7.4 million long tons on behalf of steel company partners of the mines. 
We produce various grades of iron ore pellets, including standard, fluxed and DR-grade, for use in our customers’ operations as part of the steelmaking process. The variation in grades of iron ore pellets results from the specific chemical and metallurgical properties of the ores at each mine, the end user's steelmaking process and whether or not fluxstone is added in the process. Although the grade or grades of pellets currently delivered to each customer are based on that customer’s preferences, which depend in part on the characteristics of the customer’s steelmaking operation, in many cases our iron ore pellets can be used interchangeably. Standard pellets require less processing, are generally the least costly pellets to produce and are called “standard” because no ground fluxstone, such as limestone or dolomite, is added to the iron ore concentrate before turning the concentrate into pellets. In the case of fluxed pellets, fluxstone is added to the concentrate, which produces pellets that can perform at higher productivity levels in the customer’s specific blast furnace and will minimize the amount of fluxstone the customer may be required to add to the blast furnace. DR-grade pellets require processing to make an iron unit that contains higher iron and lower silica content than a standard pellet. Unlike standard or fluxed pellets, DR-grade pellets are fed into a direct reduced iron facility, which then are converted as the raw material for an EAF producer.
Additionally, as the EAF steel market continues to grow in the U.S., there is an opportunity for our iron ore to serve this market by providing pellets to the alternative metallics market to produce direct reduced iron, hot briquetted iron and/or pig iron.  In 2016 and 2015, we produced and shipped industrial trials of low silica DR-grade pellets, which were successfully processed in a customer's EAF to obtain a high-quality direct reduced iron product. While we are still in the early stages of developing our alternative metallics business, we believe this will open up a new opportunity 
5

for us to diversify our product mix and add new customers to our U.S. Iron Ore segment beyond the traditional blast furnace clientele.
Each of our U.S. Iron Ore mines is located near the Great Lakes. The majority of our iron ore pellets are transported via railroads to loading ports for shipment via vessel to steelmakers in North America.
Our U.S. Iron Ore sales are influenced by seasonal factors in the first half of the year as shipments and sales are restricted by the Army Corp of Engineers due to closure of the Soo Locks and the Welland Canal on the Great Lakes because of winter weather. During the first quarter, we continue to produce our products, but we cannot ship most of those products via lake vessel until the conditions on the Great Lakes are navigable, which causes our first and second quarter inventory levels to rise. Our limited practice of shipping product to ports on the lower Great Lakes or to customers’ facilities prior to the transfer of title has somewhat mitigated the seasonal effect on first and second quarter inventories and sales, as shipment from this point to the customers’ operations is not limited by weather-related shipping constraints. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had approximately 1.5 million and 1.3 million long tons of pellets, respectively, in inventory at lower lakes or customers’ facilities.
U.S. Iron Ore Customers
Our U.S. Iron Ore revenues primarily are derived from sales of iron ore pellets to the North American integrated steel industry, consisting primarily of three major customers. Generally, we have multi-year supply agreements with our customers. Sales volume under these agreements largely is dependent on customer requirements, and in certain cases, we are the sole supplier of iron ore to the customer. Historically, each agreement has contained a base price that is adjusted annually using one or more adjustment factors. Factors that could result in a price adjustment include spot iron ore pricing, measures of general industrial inflation and steel prices.
During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we sold 18.2 million, 17.3 million and 21.8 million long tons of iron ore product, respectively, from our share of the production from our U.S. Iron Ore mines. Refer to Concentration of Customers below for additional information regarding our major customers.
Asia Pacific Iron Ore
Our Asia Pacific Iron Ore operations are located in Western Australia and consist solely of our wholly owned Koolyanobbing operation.
The Koolyanobbing operations serve the Asian iron ore markets with direct-shipped fines and lump ore. The lump products are fed directly to blast furnaces, while the fines products are used as sinter feed. The variation in the two export product grades reflects the inherent chemical and physical characteristics of the ore bodies mined as well as the supply requirements of our customers. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we produced 11.8 million, 11.7 million and 11.4 million metric tons, respectively.
Koolyanobbing is a collective term for the ore deposits at Koolyanobbing, Mount Jackson and Windarling. There are approximately 70 miles separating the three mining areas. Banded iron formations host the mineralization, which is predominately hematite and goethite. Each deposit is characterized with different chemical and physical attributes and, in order to achieve customer product quality, ore in varying quantities from each deposit must be blended together. 
Crushing and blending are undertaken at Koolyanobbing, where the crushing and screening plant is located. Once the blended ore has been crushed and screened into a direct lump and fines shipping product, it is transported by rail approximately 360 miles south to the Port of Esperance, via Kalgoorlie, for shipment to our customers in Asia.
Asia Pacific Iron Ore Customers
Asia Pacific Iron Ore’s production is under contract with steel companies primarily in China, Japan and South Korea. In March 2015, we extended the majority of our supply agreements with steel producers in China for two years. These contracts will currently expire in March 2017, but we anticipate that the majority of these contracts will be renewed for an additional 12 months. Our supply agreement with our client in South Korea was recently extended and will expire in December 2017. Our supply agreements with our customers in Japan currently expire in March 2017, but we anticipate these contracts also will be renewed for an additional 12 months. Pricing for our Asia Pacific Iron Ore Chinese customers consists of shorter-term pricing mechanisms of various durations up to three months based on the average of daily spot prices that are generally associated with the time of unloading of each shipment.  Pricing with our Japanese and South Korean customers is generally consistent with the inputs used with our Chinese customers, but the pricing inputs are fixed before shipment.
6

During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we sold 11.6 million, 11.6 million and 11.5 million metric tons of iron ore, respectively, from our Western Australia mines. No Asia Pacific Iron Ore customer comprised more than 10% of Cliffs consolidated sales in 2016, 2015 or 2014. The segment’s five largest customers together accounted for a total of 56%, 47% and 38% of Asia Pacific Iron Ore product revenues for the years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Discontinued Operations
North American Coal
Throughout the majority of 2015, we owned and operated two low-volatile metallurgical coal operations located in Alabama and West Virginia. These low-volatile metallurgical coal operations had a rated capacity of 6.5 million short tons of production annually.  On December 22, 2015, we sold these two low-volatile metallurgical coal operations, Pinnacle mine and Oak Grove mine, marking our exit from the coal business. Historically, we sold 4.6 million short tons in 2015 and 7.4 million short tons in 2014. On December 31, 2014, we sold our CLCC assets, which consisted of two high-volatile metallurgical coal mines and a thermal coal mine. Sales tons at the CLCC operations were 2.4 million short tons for the year ended December 31, 2014, and is included in the sales tons disclosed above.
As of March 31, 2015, management determined that our North American Coal operating segment met the criteria to be classified as held for sale under ASC 205, Presentation of Financial Statements. As such, all current and historical North American Coal operating segment results are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. Refer to NOTE 14 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS for further discussion of the North American Coal segment discontinued operations.
Eastern Canadian Iron Ore
Prior to late March 2014, we operated two iron ore mines in Eastern Canada, the Bloom Lake mine and the Wabush Scully mine. In late March 2014, we idled our Wabush Scully mine in Newfoundland and Labrador and in November 2014, we began to implement the permanent closure plan for the mine. The idle and ultimate closure was driven by the unsustainable high-cost structure. In January 2015, we ceased active production at the Bloom Lake mine and the mine transitioned to "care-and-maintenance" mode. Together, the shutdown of the Wabush Scully mine and the cessation of operations at our Bloom Lake mine represented a complete curtailment of our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore operations.
During 2014, we sold 7.2 million metric tons of iron ore concentrate and pellets, from our Eastern Canadian Iron Ore mines.
As more fully described in NOTE 14 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, in January 2015, we announced that the Bloom Lake Group commenced restructuring proceedings under the CCAA in Montreal, Quebec. Additionally, on May 20, 2015, the Wabush Group commenced restructuring proceedings under the CCAA in Montreal, Quebec and the CCAA protections granted to the Bloom Lake Group were extended to include the Wabush Group to facilitate the reorganization of each of their businesses and operations. Following each respective CCAA filing we deconsolidated the Bloom Lake Group and certain other wholly-owned subsidiaries and the Wabush Group entities, comprising substantially all of our Canadian operations. Financial results prior to the respective deconsolidations of the Bloom Lake and Wabush Groups and subsequent expenses directly associated with the Canadian Entities are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. Port and rail assets and the Bloom Lake mine were sold during 2016 under the CCAA proceedings. Refer to NOTE 14 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS for further discussion of the Eastern Canadian Iron Ore segment discontinued operations and the status of the CCAA proceedings.
Unless otherwise noted, discussion of our business and results of operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing operations.
Applied Technology, Research and Development
We have been a leader in iron ore mining and process technology since inception and have been in operation for 170 years. We operated some of the first mines on Michigan’s Marquette Iron Range and pioneered early open-pit and underground mining methods. From the first application of electrical power in Michigan’s underground mines to the use of today’s sophisticated computers and global positioning satellite systems, we have been a leader in the application of new technology to the centuries-old business of mineral extraction. Today, our engineering and technical staffs are engaged in full-time technical support of our operations, improvement of existing products and development of new products.
7

We are a pioneer in iron ore pelletizing with over 60 years of experience. We are able to produce customized pellets to meet each customer’s blast furnace specifications, and produce both standard and fluxed pellets. Using our technical expertise and strong market position in the United States to increase our product offering, we have been working on producing DR-grade pellets. In 2016 and 2015, we produced and shipped industrial trials of low silica DR-grade pellets, which were successfully processed in a customer's EAF to obtain a high-quality direct reduced iron product.
With our experienced technical professionals and unsurpassed reputation for our pelletizing technology, we continue to deliver a world-class quality product to our customers. We are a pioneer in the development of emerging reduction technologies, a leader in the extraction of value from challenging resources and a front runner in the implementation of safe and sustainable technology. Our technical experts are dedicated to excellence and deliver superior technical solutions tailored to our customer base.
Concentration of Customers
In 2016, two customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated product revenue and in 2015 and 2014 three customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated product revenue. Product revenue from those customers represented in the chart below totaled $1.1 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.9 billion of our total consolidated product revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is attributable to our U.S. Iron Ore business segment. The following represents sales revenue from each of these customers as a percentage of our total consolidated product revenue, as well as the portion of product sales for U.S. Iron Ore that is attributable to each of these customers in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively:

1 Includes subsidiaries. 
2 Effective September 16, 2014, AK Steel completed the acquisition of Severstal North America's integrated steelmaking assets located in Dearborn, Michigan. For comparative purposes, we have combined historical data for all periods presented. 
3 On October 5, 2015, we terminated the long-term agreement with Algoma; however, we entered into certain short-term contracts with Algoma throughout 2016. On May 16, 2016, we reinstated our agreement with Algoma, which took effect in January 2017. 

ArcelorMittal
Our pellet supply agreements with ArcelorMittal USA are the basis for supplying pellets to ArcelorMittal USA, which are based on customer requirements, except for the Indiana Harbor East facility, which is based on customer contract obligations. The legacy agreements with ArcelorMittal USA were set to expire at the end of December 2016 and January 2017. The parties executed a new long-term agreement, which became effective October 31, 2016, for the sale and delivery of ArcelorMittal USA’s annual tonnage requirements which fall within a specific range of volume (“AM Pellet Sale Agreement”). The AM Pellet Sale Agreement expires at the end of December 2026.
ArcelorMittal USA is a 62.3% equity participant in Hibbing and a 21.0% equity partner in Empire with limited rights and obligations. 
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, our U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales to ArcelorMittal were 9.7 million, 9.7 million and 10.2 million long tons, respectively. 
AK Steel
On September 16, 2014, AK Steel announced an acquisition of Severstal North America’s integrated steelmaking assets located in Dearborn, Michigan. We had a long-term relationship to supply iron ore pellets to that location. Upon consummation of the acquisition, the contract was automatically assigned to AK Steel. The combination of sales pursuant to our pre-existing sales agreement with AK Steel and the acquisition of the Dearborn facility with its sales agreement accounts for more than 10% of our consolidated product revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
8

On August 29, 2013, we entered into a new agreement with AK Steel to provide iron ore pellets to AK Steel for use in its Middletown, Ohio and Ashland, Kentucky blast furnace facilities. This contract includes minimum and maximum tonnage requirements for each year between 2014 and 2023. 
Under the original agreement entered into with Severstal in 2006, we supply all of the Dearborn, Michigan facility’s blast furnace pellet requirements through 2022, subject to specified minimum and maximum requirements in certain years. AK Steel was the successor by merger of this contract and it remains in force. In September 2014, we entered into an amendment to the Dearborn contract with AK Steel to document the 2013 base pricing provisions, among other things, which resulted from an arbitration ruling in May 2014. 
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, our U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales to AK Steel and the acquired Dearborn facility were 4.5 million, 4.3 million and 5.8 million long tons, respectively. 
Algoma
Algoma is a Canadian steelmaker and a subsidiary of Essar Steel Holdings Limited. We have a long-term supply agreement under which we were Algoma’s sole supplier of iron ore pellets through the end of 2016 and are required to deliver a set tonnage for less than Algoma’s entire requirements through 2024. There were multiple contract disputes that led to us filing a complaint in the Federal District Court in the Northern District of Ohio on January 12, 2015. During the litigation process, we asserted additional claims of material breach as a result of Algoma’s actions during 2015.
Cliffs and Algoma settled the dispute after Algoma filed for CCAA protection in the Canadian Superior Court of Ontario. Under the terms of the settlement, Algoma has agreed to assume the long-term supply agreement, and has entered into a separate agreement to purchase additional tonnage from Cliffs beginning 2017 through and including December 2020.
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, our U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales to Algoma were 1.2 million, 2.5 million and 3.5 million long tons, respectively.
Competition
Throughout the world, we compete with major and junior mining companies, as well as steel companies, both of which produce steelmaking raw materials, including iron ore.
North America
In our U.S. Iron Ore business segment, we primarily sell our product to steel producers with operations in North America. We compete directly with steel companies that own interests in iron ore mines in the United States and/or Canada, including ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel, and with major iron ore pellet exporters from Eastern Canada and Brazil. In 2016, finished steel import market share was 26% in the U.S., down from 29% in 2015. As a result, steel prices in North America improved, driving more demand for iron ore pellets. 
A number of factors beyond our control affect the markets in which we sell our iron ore. Continued demand for our iron ore and the prices obtained by us primarily depend on the consumption patterns of the steel industry in the U.S., China and elsewhere around the world, as well as the availability, location, cost of transportation and competing prices. 
Asia Pacific
In our Asia Pacific Iron Ore business segment, we export iron ore products to the Asia Pacific markets, including China, Japan, and South Korea. In the Asia Pacific marketplace, we compete with major iron ore exporters primarily from Australia and Brazil. These include BHP Billiton, Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., Rio Tinto plc and Vale SA, among others.
Competition in steelmaking raw materials is predicated upon the usual competitive factors of price, availability of supply, product quality and performance, service and transportation cost to the consumer of the raw materials. 
Environment 
Our mining activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. We conduct our operations in a manner that is protective of public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects.

Environmental issues and their management continued to be an important focus at each of our operations throughout 2016. In the construction of our facilities and in their operation, substantial costs have been incurred and will continue to be incurred to avoid undue effect on the environment. Our capital expenditures relating to environmental matters totaled approximately $15 million, $17 million and $33 million, in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Approximately $5 million and $3 million of the 2015 and 2014 capital expenditures, respectively, relating to environmental matters was attributable to the North American Coal operations that were sold during December 2015. Additionally, approximately $22 million of the 2014 capital expenditures relating to environmental matters was attributable to the Eastern Canadian Iron Ore operations, which are classified within discontinued operations. It is estimated that capital expenditures for environmental improvements will total approximately $25 million in 2017, which is related to our U.S. Iron Ore operations for selenium management and various water treatment, air quality, dust control, tailings management and other miscellaneous environmental projects.
Regulatory Developments
Various governmental bodies continually promulgate new or amended laws and regulations that affect our Company, our customers and our suppliers in many areas, including waste discharge and disposal, the classification of materials and products, air and water discharges and many other environmental, health and safety matters. Although we believe that our environmental policies and practices are sound and do not expect that the application of any current laws or regulations reasonably would be expected to result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, we cannot predict the collective adverse impact of the expanding body of laws and regulations.
Specifically, there are several notable proposed or potential rulemakings or activities that could have a material adverse impact on our facilities in the future depending on their ultimate outcome: Climate Change and GHG Regulation; Regional Haze, NO2 and SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards; Cross State Air Pollution Rule, increased administrative and legislative initiatives related to financial assurance obligations for CERCLA, mining and reclamation obligations; Minnesota's Mercury TMDL and associated rules governing mercury air emission reductions; evolving water quality standards for selenium, sulfate and conductivity; and scope of the Clean Water Act and the definition of “Waters of the United States”.
Climate Change and GHG Regulation
With the complexities and uncertainties associated with the U.S. and global navigation of the climate change issue as a whole, one of our significant risks for the future is mandatory carbon pricing obligations. Policymakers are in the design process of carbon regulation at the state, regional, national and international levels. The current regulatory patchwork of carbon compliance schemes presents a challenge for multi-facility entities to identify their near-term risks. Amplifying the uncertainty, the dynamic forward outlook for carbon pricing obligations presents a challenge to large industrial companies to assess the long-term net impacts of carbon compliance costs on their operations. Our exposure on this issue includes both the direct and indirect financial risks associated with the regulation of GHG emissions, as well as potential physical risks associated with climate change. We are continuing to review the physical risks related to climate change utilizing our formal ERM process. As an energy-intensive business, our GHG emissions inventory includes a broad range of emissions sources, such as iron ore furnaces and kilns, diesel mining equipment and our wholly owned Silver Bay power generation plant, among others. As such, our most significant regulatory risks are: (1) the costs associated with on-site emissions levels (direct impacts), and (2) indirect costs passed through to us from power generators and distillate fuel suppliers (indirect impacts).
Internationally, mechanisms to reduce emissions are being implemented in various countries, with differing designs and stringency, according to resources, economic structure and politics. We expect that momentum to extend carbon regulation will continue with implementation of the Paris climate agreement that was adopted in 2015, the aim of which is to keep the increase in global average temperature to below two degrees Celsius. Continued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it and potential mitigation through regulation may have a material impact on our customer base, operations and financial results in the future.
In the U.S., federal carbon regulation potentially presents a significantly greater impact to our operations. To date, the U.S. Congress has not legislated carbon constraints. In the absence of comprehensive federal carbon legislation, numerous state, regional, and federal regulatory initiatives are under development or are becoming effective, thereby creating a disjointed approach to carbon control. In May 2010, the EPA promulgated the GHG Tailoring Rule establishing a mechanism for regulating GHG emissions from facilities through the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permitting program under the Clean Air Act. Under the GHG Tailoring Rule, as modified by a 2014 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding some components of the rule, new projects that increase GHG emissions by a significant amount (generally more than 75,000 long tons of CO2 emissions per year) are subject to the PSD requirements, including 
10

the installation of best available control technology, if the project also significantly increases emissions of at least one non-GHG regulated criteria pollutant. We do not expect the Tailoring Rule provision to have a material adverse effect on our business in the near term and we cannot reliably estimate the long-term impact of the regulation. 
In June 2013, President Obama issued a memorandum directing EPA to develop carbon emission standards for both new and existing power plants under the Clean Air Act's NSPS. In October 2015, EPA promulgated the "Clean Power Plan" which consists of NSPS regulating carbon dioxide from existing power plants at a level of approximately 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. The Clean Power Plan directed states to submit SIPs to EPA by September 2016, but a U.S. Supreme Court stay of the rule in February 2016, deferred submittal of SIPs indefinitely. The Clean Power Plan does not regulate combined head and power generating facilities such as at Northshore's Silver Bay Power. We anticipate that EPA will continue to work on additional GHG NSPS regulations for other industrial categories, including the iron and steel industry; however we cannot reliably estimate the timing or long-term impact of future NSPS regulations. 
Due to the EPA's Tailoring Rule and GHG NSPS regulations, our business and customer base could suffer negative financial impacts over time as a result of increased energy, environmental and other costs to comply with the limitations that would be imposed on greenhouse gas emissions. We believe our exposure can be reduced substantially by numerous factors, including currently contemplated regulatory flexibility mechanisms, such as allowance allocations, fixed process emissions exemptions, offsets and international provisions; emissions reduction opportunities, including energy efficiency, biofuels, fuel flexibility, emerging shale gas, coal mine methane offset reduction; and business opportunities associated with pursuing combined heat and power partnerships and new products, including DR-grade pellets, fluxed pellets and other efficiency-improving technologies.
We have worked proactively to develop a comprehensive, enterprise-wide GHG management strategy aimed at considering all significant aspects associated with GHG initiatives to plan effectively for and manage climate change issues, including risks and opportunities as they relate to the environment; stakeholders, including shareholders and the public; legislative and regulatory developments; operations; products and markets.
Regional Haze
In June 2005, the EPA finalized amendments to its regional haze rules. The rules require states to establish goals and emission reduction strategies for improving visibility in all Class I national parks and wilderness areas. Among the states with Class I areas are Michigan and Minnesota in which we currently own and manage mining operations. The first phase of the regional haze rule (2008-2018) requires analysis and installation of BART on eligible emission sources and incorporation of BART and associated emission limits into SIPs.
In place of Minnesota's and Michigan's Regional Haze SIP for taconite furnaces, the EPA promulgated a Taconite Regional Haze FIP in February 2013. We, along with other stakeholders, petitioned the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals for a review of the FIP, and in May 2013, we filed a joint motion for stay of the 2013 FIP, which was granted in June 2013. We, along with the other stakeholders, reached a settlement agreement with EPA to resolve certain items in the 2013 FIP. The settlement agreement, which was published in the Federal Register in January 2015 and fully executed in April 2015, prompted EPA to grant partial reconsideration of the 2013 FIP in July 2015. Subsequently, EPA published a FIP revision final rule to implement components of the settlement agreement in April 2016, with an effective date of May 12, 2016. We believe the 2016 Regional Haze FIP reflects progress toward a more technically and economically feasible regional haze implementation plan. In November 2016, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals terminated the June 2013 stay and extended the deadlines in the original 2013 FIP by one day for each day the court's stay was in place. Cost estimates associated with implementation of the 2013 and 2016 FIPs are reflected in our five-year capital plan.
Due to inconsistencies in language describing the procedures for calculating NOx emission limits between the settlement agreement and the 2016 FIP final rule, we jointly filed a Petition for Reconsideration and Petition for Judicial Review in June 2016. We have been working toward a settlement agreement with EPA to resolve the outstanding issue with the emission limit calculation method and anticipate resolution of the issue in 2017.

NO2 and SO2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards
During the first half of 2010, the EPA promulgated rules that required each state to use a combination of air quality monitoring and computer modeling to determine each state's attainment classification status against new NO2 and SO2 NAAQS. During the third quarter of 2011, the EPA issued guidance to the regulated community on conducting refined air quality dispersion modeling and implementing the new NO2 and SO2 standards. In 2012, Minnesota issued Administrative Orders requiring taconite facilities to conduct modeling to demonstrate compliance with the NO2 and SO2 NAAQS pursuant to the Taconite Regional Haze SIP Long Term Strategy (LTS). Compliance with the LTS modeling demonstrations was originally set for June 30, 2017. Minnesota is expected to remove NAAQS modeling obligations under the LTS in light of reduction in haze emissions associated with the pending amendment of the taconite Regional Haze FIP regulations.
All of our operations in Minnesota and Michigan are expected to be in attainment for NO2 and SO2 NAAQS without incurring additional capital investment. While we will continue to monitor these developments and assess potential impacts to Cliffs, we do not anticipate further capital investments will be necessary to address NO2 and SO2 NAAQS requirements.
Cross State Air Pollution Rule
In July 2011, the EPA promulgated the CSAPR, which was intended to address interstate transport of regional haze causing pollutants (NOx and SO2) via emission limits and trading mechanisms. Northshore's Silver Bay Power plant is subject to CSAPR. Complying with CSAPR simultaneously satisfies related regional haze BART obligations because EPA has determined that CSAPR yields greater progress toward attaining EPA's regional haze goals than would application of BART. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals re-affirmed that EPA's use of CSAPR is equal to or better than BART in its March 2016 decision. Silver Bay Power's CSAPR compliance obligations are met via a combination of fuel management, installation of lower NOx burners, and purchase of NOx and SO2 allowances from the emission trading market. NOx and SO2 allowance prices continue to decline and the estimated cost to purchase NOx and SO2 allowances currently is less than $5,000.
Future NOx and SO2 emission allowances allocated to Silver Bay Power will decrease and long-term allowance prices are expected to increase. We continue to monitor the availability and pricing of CSAPR allowances and future EPA allocations of CSAPR allowances to our Silver Bay Power plant, but at this time, we do not anticipate exposure to material costs for future CSAPR obligations. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the long-term cost impact of CSAPR should EPA significantly reduce overall allowance allocations in response to future lower ozone or particulate matter 2.5 regulations. 
Mercury TMDL and Minnesota Taconite Mercury Reduction Strategy
TMDL regulations are contained in the Clean Water Act.  As a part of Minnesota's Mercury TMDL Implementation Plan, in cooperation with the MPCA, the taconite industry developed a Taconite Mercury Reduction Strategy and signed a voluntary agreement in 2009 to effectuate its terms.  The strategy includes a 75% target reduction of mercury air emissions from Minnesota pellet plants collectively by 2025.  It recognizes that mercury emission control technology currently does not exist and will be pursued through a research effort.  According to the voluntary agreement, any developed technology must meet the “adaptive management criteria” such that the technology must be economically feasible, must not impact pellet quality, and must not cause excessive corrosion in pellet furnaces, associated duct work and existing wet scrubbers on the furnaces.
According to the voluntary agreement, the mines proceeded with medium- and long-term testing of possible technologies.  For us, the requirements in the voluntary agreement apply to the United Taconite and Hibbing facilities.  At this time, we are unable to predict the potential impacts of the voluntary Taconite Mercury Reduction Strategy.  However, a number of research projects were conducted between 2011 and 2014 as the industry continued to assess options for reduction.  While injection of powdered activated carbon into furnace off-gasses for mercury capture in the wet scrubbers showed positive initial results, further testing during 2013 yielded lower overall potential. Alternate technologies are presently being assessed in our ongoing efforts to develop cost effective mercury reduction technologies for our indurating furnaces.
In September 2014, Minnesota promulgated the Mercury Air Emissions Reporting and Reduction Rule mandating mercury air emissions reporting and reduction. The adopted rule expanded applicability to all of our Minnesota operations and requires submitting a mercury reduction plan in 2018 to reduce mercury emissions from all of our Minnesota taconite furnaces by 72% by January 2025. The adopted rule does not include explicitly all four Adaptive 
12

Management Criteria for evaluating mercury reduction, which were agreed upon in the October 2009 Minnesota’s Mercury TMDL Implementation Plan. 
To date, there is currently no proven technology to cost effectively reduce mercury emissions from taconite furnaces to the target level of 72% that would meet all four Adaptive Management Criteria. We remain concerned about the technical and economic feasibility to reduce taconite mercury emissions by 72% without impacting existing operations or other environmental permit obligations and are conducting detailed engineering analysis to determine the impact of the regulations on each unique iron ore indurating furnace affected by this rule. The results of this analysis will guide further dialog with the MPCA regarding our implementation of the requirements. Because development of the technology is in the early stages, any impacts to us are not estimable at this time.
Selenium Discharge Regulation
In Michigan, Empire and Tilden have developed compliance strategies to manage selenium according to the permit conditions. Empire and Tilden submitted the first permit required Selenium Storm Water Management Plan to the MDEQ in December 2011, and have updated it annually as required. The Selenium Storm Water Management Plans have outlined the activities that will be undertaken to address selenium in storm water discharges from our Michigan operations including an assessment of potential impacts to surface and groundwater. The remaining budget for full scale implementation of the storm water collection and conveyance system by November 2017 is approximately $9 million. A storm water treatment system for both facilities is anticipated sometime before 2028. The cost of the future treatment systems could be significant, although we are continuing to assess and develop cost effective and sustainable treatment technologies. 
Tilden's NPDES permit contains a compliance schedule for selenium with a limit of five µg/l that will be effective as of November 1, 2017, at Tilden's Gribben Tailings Basin outfall.  Tilden has budgeted $7 million for 2017 for infrastructure necessary to meet the selenium effluent limit. In July 2016, the EPA published new selenium fish tissue limits and lower lentic and lotic water column concentration criteria, which may someday increase the cost for treatment should MDEQ adopt these new standards in lieu of the existing limits established under the Great Lakes Initiative. Accordingly, we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or long-term impact of the water quality criteria to our business.  
Definition of “Waters of the United States” Under the Clean Water Act
In June 2015, the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers promulgated the rule, “Definition of ‘Waters of the United States’ Under the Clean Water Act,” which attempted to add clarity to which waters are jurisdictional under the federal Clean Water Act, and will apply to all Clean Water Act programs, including certain permitting programs, spill prevention program and a state certification process.  It is unclear how the federal and state agencies will implement and enforce the final rule, and how the courts will interpret it going forward. The regulation may expand EPA’s authority under the Clean Water Act to many traditionally unregulated mine features such as mine pits, pit lakes, on site ditches, water retention structures, and tailings basins creating a new burden on our U.S. facilities.  This could be further interpreted to add questionable regulatory authority over the groundwater connections between these features and nearby traditionally navigable waters.  In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay of this rule while the jurisdiction and legality of the rule are decided in court. In January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to reconsider the Sixth Circuit's decision that it has jurisdiction to hear challenges. We are actively participating in the rulemaking development and assessing the potential impacts to our operations. Because the rule is being litigated, and until the rule is finally implemented, any impacts to us are not estimable at this time.
Minnesota’s Proposed Sulfate Wild Rice Water Quality Standard
The Minnesota Legislature provided $1.5 million in 2011 for a study to gather additional information about the effects of sulfate and other substances on the growth of wild rice, and to support an update to the sulfate wild rice water quality standard originally adopted in 1973 by the MPCA. The MPCA contracted with the University of Minnesota to conduct several research projects as part of this study. Concurrently, the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce contracted an independent lab to conduct companion research on the impacts of sulfate on wild rice. In July 2016, MPCA released a draft proposal for protecting wild rice from sulfate, which included a draft sulfate wild rice water quality standard, a draft list of waters where the standard would apply, and criteria for adding waters to that list. The draft wild rice water quality standard is an equation that utilizes measured sediment parameters to calculate a sulfate limit protective of wild rice. The independent research conducted by the independent lab contracted by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce does not directly support the validity of the MPCA’s proposed approach. The rulemaking has a legislated deadline for completion of January 15, 2018. Due to the proposed standard being based on measured sediment parameters and 
13

uncertainty regarding to which waters the standard will apply, the impacts of the proposed wild rice water quality standard to Cliffs are not estimable at this time.
Conductivity
Conductivity, the measurement of water’s ability to conduct electricity, is a surrogate parameter that generally increases as the amount of dissolved minerals in water increases. In 2011, the EPA issued A Field-Based Aquatic Life Benchmark for Conductivity in Central Appalachian Streams, which established a recommended conductivity benchmark of 300 µS/cm for the region. The issuance of a benchmark outside of the established rulemaking process was subsequently the subject of litigation in 2012 where the court ruled the benchmark is nothing more than a non-binding suggestion. Three years later in Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, et al. v. Elk Run Coal Co., et al., 3:12-cv-00785 (S.D. W. Va.), a judicial decision held that levels of conductivity higher than the EPA’s benchmark constituted a violation of the state’s narrative water quality standards, were unsupported by science and contrary to decisions previously made by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection and the West Virginia Supreme Court. In 2015, a group filed a petition with EPA Region 5 alleging that Minnesota was failing to implement properly the state NPDES program, and one of the various allegations asserts that MPCA should be assessing compliance with the state’s narrative water quality standard against the EPA’s conductivity benchmark for the Central Appalachian region. On December 30, 2015, the EPA provided MPCA a draft of the Protocol for Responding to Issues Related to Permitting and Enforcement which indicates that EPA staff will be reviewing available scientific basis in peer reviewed literature as well as promulgated standards. In February 2016, EPA's Office of Research and Development endorsed use of the Field-Based Conductivity Benchmark in northeast Minnesota indicating that a value of 320 µS/cm was appropriate to protect aquatic life. On December 23, 2016, EPA issued a notice soliciting public comments on its draft document, Field-Based Methods for Developing Aquatic Life Criteria for Specific Conductivity (SC). According to EPA, once this document is final, states and authorized tribes located in any region of the country may use the methods to develop field-based SC criteria for adoption into water quality standards. Adoption of this methodology is not certain due to significant concerns with respect to the scientific validity of the proposed method which is now under intense review by scientists working for various trade associations. Because the outcome of the Region 5 Petition and proposed Field-Based Methods for Developing Aquatic Life Criteria for Specific Conductivity is only draft guidance at this time, the exact nature and certainty of the potential risk to Cliffs cannot be predicted; however, direct application of the 320 µS/cm benchmark to Cliffs’ Minnesota-based assets may have a material adverse impact if the conductivity benchmark is applied to our NPDES permits.
CERCLA 108(b)
In December 2016, EPA published a proposed amendment to CERCLA section 108(b) which is focused on developing financial assurance for managing hazardous substances in the hardrock mining industry. The proposed rule will undergo a comment period and EPA has a court-mandated deadline for publication of the final rule by December 1, 2017. The rule requires subject facilities to calculate their level of financial responsibility based on a formula included in the rule, secure an instrument or otherwise self-assure for the calculated amount, demonstrate to EPA the proof of the security, and maintain the security until EPA releases facilities from the CERCLA 108(b) regulations. The iron mining industry is aware of several errors upon which EPA drafted the rule, including a mistaken reliance on reporting data from a wholly different industry sector (iron and steel toxic release inventory reporting). We will participate in industry-wide comments that address this and other errors and seek to exempt iron ore mining from CERCLA 108(b) applicability. With only a draft rule at this time, the final impacts of this rule to Cliffs are unknown; however, an obligation to secure and maintain financial assurance across all of our U.S. Iron Ore facilities could have a material adverse impact to our business.
Energy
Electricity
As of February 1, 2015, Wisconsin Electric Power Company is the sole supplier of electric power to our Tilden mine. As of April 24, 2015, the Tilden mine executed a special electricity contract with Wisconsin Electric Power Company. The term of the contract is through 2019. Wisconsin Electric Power Company provides 170 megawatts of electricity to Tilden at special rates that are regulated by the MPSC. The pricing under these contracts is generally fixed except Tilden is subject to frequent changes in Wisconsin Electric Power Company's power supply adjustment factor. On August 12, 2016, Tilden executed a new 20-year special contract with Wisconsin Electric that is anticipated to start on January 1, 2020. This special contract is still pending approval at the MPSC. Tilden and Empire may also incur additional liabilities depending on the outcome of various proceedings concerning MISO's revised cost allocation methodology for continued operation of the Presque Isle Power Plant in Michigan. If FERC were to decide to award SSR costs based 
14

on a revised cost allocation methodology applied retroactively, this could result in a substantial potential liability to our Tilden mine and our indefinitely-idled Empire mine. As of December 31, 2016, this potential liability of $13.6 million is included in our Statements of Consolidated Financial Position as part of Other current liabilities. Refer to NOTE 20 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES for further discussion of the Michigan Electricity Matters.
Minnesota Power supplies electric power to the Hibbing and United Taconite mines. On September 16, 2008, Hibbing finalized an agreement with terms from November 1, 2008 through December 31, 2015. The agreement was approved by the MPUC in 2009. The terms of the agreement included an automatic five-year extension that began January 1, 2016. The United Taconite mine executed a new ten-year agreement with Minnesota Power that also included the Babbitt Mine. This agreement was finalized on May 22, 2016 and was approved by the MPUC on November 9, 2016.
Silver Bay Power, a wholly owned subsidiary of ours with a 115 megawatt power plant, provides the majority of Northshore’s electrical energy requirements. Silver Bay Power has an interconnection agreement with Minnesota Power for backup power when excess generation is necessary. On May 22, 2016, Silver Bay Power entered into an agreement with Minnesota Power to purchase roughly half of Northshore's electricity needs from Minnesota Power through 2019. On January 1, 2020, Silver Bay Power will purchase 100% of the electricity requirements of Northshore from Minnesota Power and Silver Bay Power plans to idle both of its generating units except under certain circumstances.
Koolyanobbing and its associated satellite mine deposits draw power from independent diesel-fueled power stations and generators. Diesel power generation capacity has been installed at the Koolyanobbing operations.
Process and Diesel Fuel
We have a long-term contract providing for the transport of natural gas on the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline for our U.S. Iron Ore operations. The Tilden mine has the capability of burning natural gas, coal or, to a lesser extent, oil. The Hibbing and Northshore mines have the capability to burn natural gas and oil. The United Taconite mine has the ability to burn coal, natural gas and petroleum coke. Consistent with 2016, we expect during 2017 our U.S. Iron Ore operations will utilize both natural gas and coal to heat furnaces and produce power at our Silver Bay Power facility. 
All of our mines utilize diesel fuel mainly for our mobile fleet. Thompson Gas supplies diesel fuel to all of our U.S. Iron Ore locations from the Calumet refinery in Superior, Wisconsin. Our U.S. Iron Ore locations are contracted with Como Oil and Propane through the end of 2018.

1 Includes our employees and the employees of the U.S. Iron Ore joint ventures. 
2 Excludes contracted mining employees. 
3 Excludes employees considered on lay-off status as a result of an indefinite or temporary idle. As of December 31, 2016, this would include those impacted by the indefinite idling of the Empire mine, and as of December 31, 2015, this would include those impacted by the temporary idlings of the United Taconite and Northshore mines. 

As of December 31, 2016, approximately 80% of our active U.S. Iron Ore hourly employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Hourly employees at our Michigan and Minnesota iron ore mining operations, excluding Northshore, are represented by the USW and are covered by labor agreements between the USW and our various operating entities. These labor agreements that cover approximately 2,000 active USW-represented employees at our Empire and Tilden mines in Michigan, and our United Taconite and Hibbing mines in Minnesota are valid through September 30, 2018. Employees at our Northshore operations are not represented by a union and are not, therefore, covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Hourly employees at our LS&I railroads are represented by seven unions covering approximately 100 employees. The labor agreements that cover these employees reopened for bargaining on December 31, 2014 and we are actively bargaining for successor agreements. These employees negotiate under the Railway Labor Act, which provides that labor agreements remain in force until replaced by a successor agreement. Under the Railway Labor Act work stoppages cannot occur until the parties have engaged in substantial negotiations, have mediated any disputes and have received a release from the National Mediation Board.
Employees at our Asia Pacific Iron Ore, Corporate and Support Services are not represented by a union and are not, therefore, covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Safety
Safety is our primary core value as we continue toward a zero incident culture at all of our facilities.  We continuously monitor, measure, and track our safety performance and make improvements where necessary.  Best practices are shared globally to ensure each mine site can effectively administer our policies, procedures and learnings for enhanced workplace safety. Progress toward achieving our objectives is measured against established benchmarks, including our company-wide TRIR. During 2016, our TRIR (including contractors) was 1.41 per 200,000 man-hours worked.  
Refer to Exhibit 95 Mine Safety Disclosures (filed herewith) for mine safety information required in accordance with Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
