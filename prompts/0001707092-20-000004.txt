ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Delphi Technologies PLC (“Delphi Technologies,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) is a leader and pioneer in the development, design and manufacture of vehicle propulsion systems that enable vehicles to drive cleaner, better and further, by optimizing engine performance, increasing vehicle efficiency, reducing emissions, improving driving performance, and supporting their electrification. We are a global supplier of advanced technologies and solutions for propulsion systems to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of both light vehicles (passenger cars, trucks, vans and sport-utility vehicles) and commercial vehicles (light-duty, medium-duty and heavy-duty trucks, commercial vans, buses and off-highway vehicles). In addition, we manufacture and sell a wide range of products and services to leading aftermarket customers and original equipment service customers. 
On December 4, 2017, we became an independent publicly-traded company, following the separation of the Powertrain Systems segment of Aptiv PLC, formerly known as Delphi Automotive PLC (the “Former Parent”). The separation was completed in the form of a pro-rata distribution to the Former Parent’s shareholders of 100% of the ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies PLC (the “Separation”). 
On January 28, 2020, we announced that we had entered into a definitive transaction agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) under which BorgWarner Inc. (“BorgWarner”), a global product leader in clean and efficient technology solutions for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles, will acquire Delphi Technologies in an all-stock transaction pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (the “Scheme of Arrangement”) under Part 18A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended from time to time (the “Transaction”). Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction Agreement and the Scheme of Arrangement, Delphi Technologies’ shareholders will receive, in exchange for each Delphi Technologies ordinary share, 0.4534 shares of BorgWarner common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and cash in lieu of any fractional share of BorgWarner common stock. The Transaction is anticipated to close in the second half of 2020, subject to approval by our shareholders, the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions and receipt of certain regulatory approvals.

We encourage investors to visit our website, as we frequently update and post new information about our company on our website and it is possible that this information could be deemed to be material information. Our website is not, however, a part of this report.
Our Segments
In July 2019, our chief operating decision maker announced changes to our organization structure. The changes included reorganizing the management reporting structure to better align our product portfolios and process technology expertise. As a result of these changes, as of December 31, 2019, the Company’s former Powertrain Systems segment has been organized into three distinct segments on the basis of similar products and operating factors. The Aftermarket segment is unchanged. Our business operates in the following four segments:
Fuel Injection Systems. This segment includes gasoline and diesel fuel injection components and systems. Our gasoline fuel injection portfolio includes a full suite of fuel injection technologies – including pumps, injectors, fuel rail assemblies and complete systems – that deliver greater efficiency for traditional and hybrid vehicles with gasoline combustion engines. The Company’s Gasoline Direct Injection (“GDi”) technology provides high-precision fuel delivery for optimized combustion, which lowers emissions and improves fuel economy. Our diesel fuel injection systems portfolio provides enhanced engine performance at an attractive value. The Company’s common rail fuel injection system is the core technology for both on and off-highway commercial and light vehicle applications.
Powertrain Products. This segment includes an array of highly engineered products for traditional combustion and hybrid electric vehicles, including variable valvetrain, smart remote actuators, powertrain sensors, ignition products, canisters, and fuel handling products. These products complement and enhance the efficiency improvements delivered by our fuel injection systems technologies.
Electrification & Electronics. Our electronics portfolio consists of engine and transmission control modules and power electronics. The control modules, containing as much as one million lines of software code, are key components that enable the integration and operation of powertrain products throughout the vehicle. As electrification increases, our proprietary solutions – 
including supervisory controllers, software, DC/DC converters and inverters – provide better efficiency, reduced weight and lower cost for our OEM customers, while also making these and other components easier to integrate. Manufacturers are also choosing to combine power electronic functionality into one unit, enabling more effective packaging at a lower total cost while increasing Delphi Technologies’ content per vehicle. 
Aftermarket. Through this segment we sell products and services to independent aftermarket customers and original equipment service customers. Our aftermarket product portfolio includes a wide range of solutions covering the fuel injection, electronics and engine management, maintenance, and test equipment and vehicle diagnostics categories.
Growth Strategies
Our strategy is to continue to accelerate the development of market-relevant technologies that solve our customers’ increasingly complex challenges and implement a leaner, more flexible cost structure to deliver margin expansion and revenue, earnings and cash flow growth over the long-term. We seek to grow our business through the execution of the following strategies, among others:

• | Leverage Our Technology Leadership. We have strong positions in fuel injectors, fuel pumps, and complete fuel-injection systems, including software and controls. Additionally, we provide leading technology solutions in the areas of electronics and electrification, including engine control modules and power electronics, where we see growth over the long-term driven by increasing levels of electrification. Our power electronics technologies include products such as high-voltage inverters, DC/DC converters and on-board chargers that transfer electrical energy to enable hybrid and electric vehicle propulsion systems. Our comprehensive portfolio of powertrain products, combined with our proprietary software and controls, enables industry-leading propulsion systems for internal combustion engines, hybrids and electric vehicles.


• | Focused Regional Strategies. We have a presence in all major regions of the world and have positioned ourselves as a leading supplier of advanced vehicle propulsion technologies, including electrification, that are tailored to satisfy our customers’ needs in each region. We are focused on providing technologies and solutions that solve some of our customers’ most complex propulsion challenges, by enabling our customers to meet increasingly stringent local regulatory requirements while also enhancing vehicle performance.


• | Continue to Enhance Aftermarket Position. Globally, we plan to expand margins by focusing on higher value product lines such as electronics and services, which include diagnostics and remanufacturing. We expect that demand for these product lines will grow faster than the overall aftermarket industry as the electronics content of new vehicles continues to increase, providing a strong foundation to gain scale profitably in the future. In addition, we expect to benefit from Aftermarket growth in key regions around the world, especially China, as the average age of vehicles increases and expands the need for replacement products.


• | Implement a Leaner and More Flexible Cost Structure. We continue to take actions to address our cost competitiveness through increased operational efficiency, reshaping and realigning our engineering footprint, maximizing manufacturing output and placement of our facilities in best-cost countries. We have ongoing processes and resources dedicated to further improve our operations.

Our Industry
The automotive and commercial vehicle parts industry provides components, systems, subsystems and modules to OEMs for the manufacture of new vehicles, as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts. In 2019, global vehicle production (including light and commercial vehicles) decreased 6% versus the previous year, reflecting a decrease of 9% in China, 4% in Europe, 4% in North America and 4% in South America.
Demand for automotive components in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment and other trends. In the commercial vehicle market, vehicle production is primarily driven by industrial production, the amount of freight tonnage being transported and the availability of credit and interest rates. 
Heightened Regulatory Environment
OEMs continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets. Authorities in the European Union, the United States (“U.S.”), China, India, Japan, Brazil, South Korea and Argentina have already instituted regulations requiring further reductions in emissions and/or increased fuel economy. Authorities have also initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten standards through 2020 and beyond. 
In order to comply with these regulations, OEMs and suppliers must find ways to improve fuel injection and combustion efficiency, engine management, electrical power consumption, vehicle weight and integration of alternative powertrains (e.g., electric/hybrid propulsion). As a result, we are continuing to develop innovations that result in improvements in fuel economy, emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines and permit engine downsizing without loss of performance.
Standardization of Sourcing by OEMs
Many OEMs continue to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization, reduce per-unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. As a result, OEMs are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations. As a supplier with global scale and strong design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, we are well positioned to benefit from this trend. OEMs are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs. As a supplier that can provide fully-engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts, we are well positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing.
Shorter Product Development Cycles To Benefit Strong Suppliers
OEMs are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations. As a supplier with strong technologies, global engineering and development capabilities, we are well positioned to meet OEM demands for rapid innovation.
Increasing Demand for Electronics
Vehicles are increasingly complex in their design, features, level of integration of mechanical and electrical components and increasing levels of software necessary to deliver their functionality. Electronics integration, which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits, software algorithms, sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle, will allow OEMs to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity. In turn, this results in enhanced fuel economy, improved emissions control and better vehicle performance. We are well positioned to benefit from accelerating industry demand for electronics integration and vehicle electrification. Moreover, our proprietary power electronics solutions enable our OEM customers to improve efficiency and reduce weight, which helps vehicles drive cleaner, better and further.
Competition
The automotive parts industry remains extremely competitive. The industry has attracted, and may continue to attract, new entrants in areas of emerging vehicle technologies. Although OEMs prefer to maintain relationships with suppliers that have a proven record of performance, they rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality, price, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design capability, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, financial viability, application of lean principles, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management.
Customers
Our business is diversified across end-markets, regions, customers, vehicle platforms and products. We sell our products and services to the major global automotive and commercial vehicle OEMs in every region of the world. We also sell our products and services to the worldwide aftermarket for replacement parts, including the aftermarket operations of our OEM customers and to other distributors and retailers. Our global customer base includes 22 of the largest light vehicle OEMs, several of the largest commercial vehicle OEMs, and members of all of the global automotive aftermarket trading groups, which include most of the leading aftermarket retailers and wholesale distributors around the world. Our ten largest platforms in 2019 were with nine different OEMs. In addition, in 2019 our solutions were found in the majority of the top twenty platforms in each of the regions in which we operate. Our revenue base is also geographically diverse, and in 2019, 45% of our net sales were derived from Europe, 28% from North America, 24% from Asia Pacific and 3% from South America. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to Volkswagen AG accounted for 11% of net sales. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no customers with sales greater than 10% of our net sales.
Supply Relationships with Our Customers
We typically supply products to our OEM customers through purchase orders, which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each OEM. Although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer, they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. These relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle. Prices are negotiated with respect to each business award, which may be subject to 
adjustments under certain circumstances, such as commodity or foreign exchange escalation/de-escalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us. The terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied; in most cases, the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the OEM to the end-user of the vehicle. We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products.
Individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or non-performance and, in most cases, upon our insolvency and certain change of control events. In addition, many of our OEM customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs, which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program, potentially reducing our profit margins and increasing the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts. We manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules, normally provided on a weekly basis, which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels.
Customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of OEM production during such future periods, customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders. Firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials, sub-components and work-in-process inventory for OEM orders and from current on-hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders. The dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved.
Materials
We procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world. Generally, we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured to minimize transportation and other costs. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements. 
In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks.
Research, Development and Intellectual Property
During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we announced plans to restructure our global technical center footprint and reduce salaried and contract staff. However, we will maintain sufficient technical engineering centers to develop and provide advanced products, processes and manufacturing support for all of our manufacturing sites, and to provide our customers with local engineering and design capabilities on a global basis.
We believe that our engineering and technical expertise, together with our emphasis on continuing research and development, allow us to use the latest technologies, materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new, innovative products to market. We believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products. We seek to effectively manage costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs, including investment in new technology. We maintain our engineering activities around our core product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with differentiated technology positions.

We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. While no individual patent or group of patents, taken alone, is considered material to our business, taken in the aggregate, these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations. In addition, we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace.
Environmental Compliance
We are subject to the requirements of environmental, safety and health laws and regulations in each country in which we operate. These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge, hazardous materials and waste management. We have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally. Although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations, we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot assure that our future environmental costs and liabilities will not be material.
Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances. At this time, we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities. In addition, there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities.
At December 31, 2019, the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately $3 million. We cannot assure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Seasonality
Our business is moderately seasonal, as our primary North American customers historically reduce production during the month of July and halt operations for approximately one week in December. Our European customers generally reduce production during the months of July and August and for one week in December. Our Chinese customers generally reduce production during the Chinese New Year that occurs during the first quarter of each year. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. In addition, automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of July, August and September due to the launch of parts production for new vehicle models. Accordingly, our results reflect this seasonality.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 21,000 workers: 8,000 salaried employees, 11,000 hourly employees and 2,000 contract and temporary workers. Our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils, including the European Works Council and local trade unions such as Unite, United Kingdom, CFE-CGC France and C.T.M. in Mexico. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced plans to restructure our global technical center footprint, which includes reducing salaried and contract staff by approximately 10%. These actions are subject to consultation with employee works councils and other employee representatives and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2021.
