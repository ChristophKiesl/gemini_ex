ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL
 
Community West Bancshares, a California corporation, is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or “BHCA,” with corporate headquarters in Goleta, California.  CWBC's common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the trading symbol "CWBC". CWBC's principal business is to serve as the holding company for its wholly-owned subsidiary Community West Bank, N.A., a national banking association chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).  Through CWB, the Company provides a variety of financial products and services to customers through seven full-service branch offices in the cities of Goleta, Oxnard, Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, and Ventura, California.
 
The Company’s operations and financial results in 2020 were substantially influenced by the COVID-19 global pandemic (the COVID-19 pandemic, or the pandemic).  Such impacts have included significant volatility in the global stock and fixed income markets, a 150-basis-point reduction in the target federal funds rate, the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA), and a variety of rulings from the Company’s banking regulators. The California governor issued a stay-at-home order which limited gatherings and travel and required workers who are not necessary to sustain or protect life to work from or stay at home.  The orders, as a result of COVID-19, have led to financial stress for many businesses and workers throughout the communities the Company serves.
 
In response, the Company updated operating protocols to ensure all banking services continued while prioritizing the health and safety of clients and associates. The branch lobbies remained opened to service clients utilizing the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, and in compliance with State and Local Orders, as pronounced and updated from time to time. Sales associates, support teams and management largely continued working remotely; however, associates located in the Company's corporate offices and operations centers began to gradually return to those locations at reduced capacity levels in the third quarter. In addition, the Company has maintained its focus on enhancing remote, mobile, and online processes and controls.
 
To assist clients during the pandemic, the Company implemented distinct COVID-19 relief programs to provide payment deferrals, fee waivers, and suspension of residential property foreclosures. The Company also actively monitored the actions of federal and state governments to proactively assist clients and ensure awareness of each financial assistance program available.

The Bank underwent a significant level of cross training and redeployment of associate resources to rapidly meet the influx of client requests in response to the passage of the CARES Act, the establishment of the PPP and the approval of the Consolidated Appropriations Act. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 501 active PPP loans with $69.5 million in balances, net of unearned fees of $1.6 million.
  
Further, as of December 31, 2020, the Company had $5.1 million in loans, or 0.5% of the total portfolio, that were deferred to provide relief to borrowers adversely impacted by the pandemic.
 
These programs, along with the SBA PPP, could mask or delay the detection or reporting of deterioration in credit quality indicators. The industries most heavily impacted include retail, healthcare, hospitality, schools, and energy. The Company’s management team has evaluated the loans related to the affected industries, and at December 31, 2020, the Bank’s loans to these industries were $179.2 million, which is 20.9% of our $857.6 million loan portfolio.
 
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted.  Future developments include new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. We expect the significance of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of its effect on our financial and operational results, to be dictated by, among other factors, its duration, the success of efforts to contain it and the impact of actions taken in response. Uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic is pervasive, and the pandemic will likely impact our operations, clients, and various areas of risk; however, we are unable at this time, to estimate the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ongoing financial and operational results. The Company expects to see continued volatility in the economic markets and government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. These changing conditions and governmental responses could have impacts on the balance sheet and income statement of the Company  into 2021.
 
Human Capital
 
The Company’s vision is to be the Bank of choice, providing an unparalleled experience for our clients, employees and community. Attracting, retaining and developing high performing employees and providing them with a remarkable employee experience are key to providing a remarkable client experience, and are important contributors to the Bank’s success.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
 The Company is committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving a culture of diversity and inclusion.  Human Capital is among the most valuable of assets. The collective sum of individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, self-expression, unique capabilities and talent that the Company’s employees invest in their work represents a significant part of the Company’s culture, reputation and achievements.  The Company’s diversity initiatives and awareness are applicable—but not limited—to practices and protocols on recruitment and selection; compensation; professional development and training; promotions; transfers; and the ongoing development of a work environment built on the premise of gender and diversity equity that encourages and enforces respectful communication, teamwork, employee participation with representation of all groups and employee perspectives, work/life balance, and employer and employee contributions to the communities they serve to promote a greater understanding and respect for diversity.
Talent Acquisition
 The Company’s demand for qualified candidates grows as the Company’s business grows.  Building a diverse and inclusive workforce is a component of the Company’s talent strategy.  The Company attracts talented individuals with a combination of competitive pay and benefits.  Through talent management, career development, and succession planning, the Company is striving to source a meaningful percentage of candidates internally, in addition to candidates located within the communities the Company serves.

Professional Development
 The Company’s talent management program is an interactive practice that engages employees through performance check-ins and reviews, goal setting, individual development plans, and continuous coaching and feedback.  The Company offers a variety of programs to help employees learn new skills, establish and meet personalized development goals, take on new roles, advance their careers and become better leaders.
Employee Engagement
 The Company recognizes that employees who are involved in, enthusiastic about, and committed to their work and workplace contribute meaning-fully to the success of the Company.  In addition to the Executive Management Team, two Committees have been formed to address engagement through a lens of equity and inclusion:  The Elevate Committee and the Leadership Committee.  The Elevate Committee is comprised of entry- to mid-level employees from all departments and branches, with priorities on elevating those voices and fostering an inclusive and collaborative team environment.  The Leadership Committee is comprised of senior managers and leaders across the functional areas with a focus on tactical planning for execution of key strategic initiatives, efficiencies and improvements to benefit both the client and the employee experience.  The Company solicits employee feedback through a confidential company-wide survey on culture, management, career opportunities, compensation and benefits.  The results of this survey are reviewed with management and are used to recognize improvements and focus on areas of concern, as well as update employee programs, initiatives and communications.  The Company has a number of other engagement initiatives, including quarterly town hall meetings with the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and senior executives, quarterly and annual employee recognition events, and opportunities for variable pay outside of review cycles.
Succession Planning
 The Company is focused on facilitating internal succession by encouraging internal mobility, enhancing its talent pool through professional development programs, structuring training programs to teach skills valuable in navigating the changing world of financial services, creating career paths and development action plans for career advancement, and expanding opportunities through diversity and inclusion initiatives and efforts.
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
CWB is focused on relationship-based banking for small- to medium-sized businesses and their owners, professional, high-net worth individuals, and non-profit organizations in the communities served by its branch offices.  The products and services provided include deposit products such as checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, fixed rate, fixed maturity certificates of deposits, treasury management products, and lending products, including commercial, commercial real estate, agricultural and consumer loans.
 
 Competition in our markets remains healthy.  The Company continues to be competitive due to its focus on high quality customer service and our experienced relationship bankers who have strong relationships within the communities the Company serves.


Manufactured Housing
 
The Company has a financing program for manufactured housing to provide affordable home ownership.  These loans are offered in approved mobile home parks throughout California primarily on or near the coast.  The parks must meet specific criteria. The manufactured housing loans are secured by the manufactured home and are retained in the Company’s loan portfolio.
Agricultural Loans for Real Estate and Operating Lines
 
The Company has an agricultural lending program for agricultural land, agricultural operational lines, and agricultural term loans for crops, equipment, and livestock.  These loan products are partially guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), the Farm Service Agency (“FSA”), and the USDA Business and Industry loan program.  The FSA typically issues a 90% guarantee up to $1,776,000 (amount adjusted annually based on inflation) for up to 40 years.
 
The Company also originates and sells loans to the secondary market through the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation ("Farmer Mac") program.  Farmer Mac provides the Company with access to flexible, low-cost financing and effective risk management tools to help farm, ranch, and rural utility clients.
 
Small Business Administration Lending
 
CWB has been a preferred lender/servicer of loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) since 1990. The Company originates SBA loans which can be sold into the secondary market.  The Company continues to service these loans after sale and is required under the SBA programs to retain specified amounts.  The primary SBA loan program that CWB offers is the Section 504 (“504”) program.
 
CWB also offers Business & Industry ("B&I") loans. These loans are similar to the SBA product, except they are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The maximum guaranteed amount is 80%. B&I loans are made to businesses in designated rural areas and are generally larger loans to larger businesses than the 7(a) loans. Similar to the SBA 7(a) product, they can be sold into the secondary market.

As a Preferred Lender, CWB has been delegated the loan approval, closing and most servicing and liquidation responsibility from the SBA.
 
Under the CARES Act, CWB offered SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.  The loans are forgivable in whole or in part and carry a fixed rate of 1% for a term of two years (loans made before June 5, 2020) or five years (loans made after June 5, 2020), if not forgiven, in whole or in part.  Payments are deferred until either the date on which the SBA remits the amount of the forgiveness proceeds to the lender or the date that is 10 months after the day of the covered period if the borrower does not apply for forgiveness within the 10-month period.
 
Loans to One Borrower
 
Under federal law, the unsecured obligations of any one borrower to a national bank generally may not exceed 15% of the sum of the Bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, and the secured and unsecured obligations of any one borrower. CWB was approved to increase this lending limit under the OCC’s Special Lending Limits Program to 25% on selected products. This program ensures that national bank lending limits, such as CWB’s, would remain competitive with state-chartered banks. In addition, California state banking law generally limits the amount of funds that a state-chartered bank may lend to a single borrower to 15% of the Bank's capital for unsecured loans and 25% of the Bank's capital for secured loans, and considers real estate secured loans as “secured” for lending limits purposes.
Foreign Operations
 
The Company has no foreign operations. The Bank may provide loans, letters of credit and other trade-related services to commercial enterprises that conduct business outside the United States.
Customer Concentration
 
The Company does not have any customer relationships that individually account for 10% of consolidated or segment revenues, respectively.
 
COMPETITION
 
The financial services industry is highly competitive. Many of the Bank's competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, have higher lending limits, can offer a broader range of financial services than the Bank can offer, and may have lower cost structures.
 
 This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of long-term changes in regulation that made mergers and geographic expansion easier; changes in technology and product delivery systems and web-based tools; the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers; and the flight of deposit clients to perceived increased safety. The Company competes for clients related to loans and deposits and customers with other banks, credit unions, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, and other non-bank financial services providers. This strong competition for deposit and loan products directly affects the rates of those products and the terms on which they are offered to consumers.


Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets.
 
Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks to consolidate their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues to remain competitive. The competitive environment is also significantly impacted by federal and state legislation that makes it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with the Company.
 
GOVERNMENT POLICIES
 
The Company’s operations are affected by various state and federal legislative changes and by regulations and policies of various regulatory authorities, including those of the states in which it operates and the U.S. government. These laws, regulations and policies include, for example, statutory maximum legal lending rates, domestic monetary policies by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System which impact interest rates, U.S. fiscal policy, anti-terrorism and money laundering legislation and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by bank regulatory agencies. Changes in these laws, regulations and policies may greatly affect our operations. See “Item 1A Risk Factors – Curtailment of government guaranteed loan programs could affect a segment of our business” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Supervision and Regulation.”
