Corporate History 
 General 
 Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada in May 2013 under the name Marika Inc. Prior to a reverse merger that occurred on December 17, 2014, or the Acquisition, Marika Inc. was a shell company registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, with a business of operating an errand concierge service online marketplace until it began operating the business of Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH, or Pieris GmbH, through the Acquisition on December 17, 2014. Pieris GmbH (formerly Pieris AG, a German company which was founded in 2001 by Prof. Dr. Arne Skerra, Professor at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, and Claus Schalper) continues as the operating subsidiary of the Company. As used herein, the words the Company, we, us, and our refer to Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. operating the business of Pieris GmbH as a wholly-owned subsidiary, which business continues as the business of the Company. 
 Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a holding company and the sole stockholder of Pieris GmbH. The corporate headquarters and research facility of Pieris GmbH are located in Freising, Germany. Pieris Australia Pty Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pieris GmbH, was formed on February 14, 2014 to conduct research and development in Australia. 
 Business Overview 
 We are a clinical stage biotechnology company that discovers and develops Anticalin-based drugs to target validated disease pathways in a unique and transformative way. Our pipeline includes immuno-oncology multi-specifics tailored for the tumor microenvironment, an inhaled Anticalin to treat uncontrolled asthma and a half-life-optimized Anticalin to treat anemia. Our proprietary Anticalin proteins are a novel class of protein therapeutics validated in the clinic and by partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies. 
 Anticalin proteins are a class of low molecular-weight therapeutic proteins derived from lipocalins, which are naturally occurring low-molecular weight human proteins typically found in blood plasma and other bodily fluids. Anticalin®-branded proteins function similarly to monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, by binding tightly and specifically to a diverse range of targets. An antibody is a large protein used by the immune system that recognizes a unique part of a foreign target molecule, called an antigen. We believe Anticalin proteins possess numerous advantages over antibodies in certain applications. For example, Anticalin proteins are small in size and are monomeric, meaning single protein units rather than a multi-protein complex. Therefore, we believe Anticalins are generally more stable biophysically than tetrameric monoclonal antibodies, composed of four protein subunits, potentially enabling unique routes of drug administration such as pulmonary delivery. Higher-molecular-weight entities, such as antibodies, are often too large to be delivered effectively through these methods. In addition, Anticalin proteins are monovalent in structure, which means they bind to a single cell surface receptor and which may avoid the risk of cross-linking of cell surface receptors where such receptors are a therapeutic target. Antibody-mediated cross-linking can occur when each of the two arms of an antibody binds to a cell surface receptor and brings these receptors into close proximity, which can lead to aggressive cell growth that is characteristic of cancer. While our basic Anticalin proteins have only a single binding site and are not subject to such cross-linking, our Anticalin-branded technology is also modular, which allows us to design Anticalin proteins to bind with specificity to multiple targets at the same time. This multispecificity offers advantages in biological settings where binding to multiple targets can enhance the ability of a drug to achieve its desired effects, such as killing cancer cells. Moreover, unlike antibodies, the pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of Anticalin proteins can be adjusted to potentially enable program-specific optimal drug exposure. Such differentiating characteristics suggest that Anticalin proteins have the potential, in certain cases, to become first-in-class drugs.

We have access to intellectual property rights directed to various aspects of our Anticalin® technology platform, allowing for development and advancement of our platform and drug candidates. We believe our ownership and/or license of our Anticalin platform provides us with a strong intellectual property position, particularly where we are seeking to address targets and diseases in a novel way and for which there is existing monoclonal antibody intellectual property. 
 Our core Anticalin® technology and platform were developed in Germany, and we have collaboration arrangements with major multi-national pharmaceutical companies headquartered in the U.S., Europe and Japan. These include existing agreements with Daiichi Sankyo Company Limited, or Daiichi, Sanofi Group, or Sanofi, and F.HoffmannLa Roche Ltd. and HoffmannLa Roche Inc., or Roche. We also established a collaboration with Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier, or Servier, in January 2017 and entered into an exclusive license agreement with Aska Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Aska, in February 2017. We have discovery and preclinical collaboration and service agreements with both academic institutions and private firms in Australia, which increasingly are handled through Pieris Australia Pty Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pieris GmbH. 
 We believe that the drug-like properties of the Anticalin drug class were demonstrated in various clinical trials with different Anticalin-based drug candidates, including PRS-080. 
 Our current development plans focus mainly on four drug candidates, PRS-080, PRS-060, PRS-343 and PRS-332.
PRS-080 is an Anticalin protein that binds to hepcidin, a natural regulator of iron in the blood. An excess amount of hepcidin can cause functional iron deficiency, or FID, which often cannot be treated adequately with iron supplements and can lead to anemia. PRS-080 has been designed to target hepcidin for the treatment of FID in anemic patients with chronic kidney disease, or CKD, particularly in end-stage renal disease patients requiring dialysis. We believe that by blocking the actions of hepcidin, PRS-080 will serve to address anemia by mobilizing iron for incorporation into red blood cells. Furthermore, we engineered PRS-080 to have a half-life of less than a week, so that following administration, it is expected to clear from the human body in a much shorter time frame than antibodies, which typically have a half-life of two weeks or greater. We believe a shorter residence time in the body may be a superior approach for countering excess hepcidin, as physiological levels of hepcidin in these patients are relatively high (nanomolar concentration), and in theory such high concentrations will quickly saturate an administered binding drug. As a result, frequent administration of a drug may be required in order to sufficiently antagonize, or suppress the effect of, the target. The longer residence time of a mAb, could lead to the accumulation of both the drug and the target beyond the typical residence time of hepcidin, resulting in large quantities of hepcidin bound to mAbs. PRS-080 was investigated in a single-ascending dose Phase Ia trial in healthy subjects under governance by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, or BfArM). This study was completed in 2015. The next phase of clinical development is a Phase Ib, single ascending dose study in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis, which commenced in the first quarter of 2016 and completed dosing of all patients in the first quarter of 2017 in order to study safety and pharmacological activity in CKD patients. Data un-blinding and subsequent disclosure is currently planned for the second quarter of 2017. We also plan to initiate a multi-dose clinical study in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis in the second quarter of 2017, which will assess the ability of PRS-080 to elevate hemoglobin over a period of approximately four weeks. 
 The second Anticalin drug candidate, PRS-060, binds to the IL-4 receptor alpha-chain (IL-4RA), thereby inhibiting the actions of IL-4 and IL-13, two cytokines (small proteins mediating signaling between cells within the human body) known to be key mediators in the inflammatory cascade that causes asthma and other inflammatory diseases. The small size and biophysical stability of PRS-060 enables direct delivery to the lungs, through the use of an inhaler, which we believe will enable high pulmonary concentrations of the drug candidate to be achieved at substantially lower doses than would be reached with antibodies that are systemically delivered. Further, PRS-060 has a short systemic residence time, which we believe may avoid undesired target engagement 
 
6 
 
 outside of the desired area in the lungs. PRS-060 is currently undergoing IND-enabling activities, and we intend to begin a Phase I clinical trial with PRS-060 in the second half of 2017. 
 The third Anticalin-based drug candidate, PRS-343, is a bispecific protein targeting the immune receptor CD137 and the tumor target HER2. PRS-343 is the result of a genetic fusion of a variant of the HER2-targeting antibody trastuzumab with an Anticalin specific for CD137. The mode of action of this CD137/ HER2 bispecific is to promote CD137 clustering by bridging CD137-positive T cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a potent costimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells. PRS-343 is intended to localize CD137 activation in the tumor, and to thereby both increase efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity compared to CD137-targeting antibodies being developed by third parties in clinical trials. PRS-343 is currently undergoing IND-enabling activities, and we intend to begin a Phase I clinical trial with PRS-343 in the second half of 2017. 
 The fourth Anticalin-based drug candidate, PRS-332, is a bispecific protein targeting the immune checkpoint PD-1 and another, undisclosed immune checkpoint. PRS-332 is the result of a genetic fusion of a variant of a PD-1-targeting antibody with an Anticalin specific undisclosed immune checkpoint. The mode of action of this bispecific is to simultaneously engage each immune checkpoint on a T cell, and to thereby provide a potent signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells. PRS-332 is currently undergoing preclinical evaluation and is the most advanced program included in the companys Servier collaboration. 
 PRS-343 and PRS-332 are members of our set of oncology drug candidates known as the 300-Series platform within a product opportunity in immuno-oncology. The 300-Series Anticalin proteins target immune checkpoints, like PRS-332, or, like PRS-343, immune-stimulatory proteins and define a variety of multifunctional biotherapeutics that genetically link two distinct Anticalin proteins together or, as with PRS-332 and PRS-343, an antibody with one or more Anticalin proteins, thereby constituting a multispecific protein. Checkpoint proteins (e.g. PD-1) are proteins that help the development of an immune response or downregulate the response, for example when an infection is eliminated while co-stimulatory proteins (e.g. CD-137) upregulate the immune response. 
 Strategy 
 Our goal is to become a fully integrated biotechnology company by discovering and developing Anticalin based therapeutics to target validated disease pathways in a unique and transformative way, and later developing and commercializing our products. We intend to take advantage of our operational experience in technology development and our history of successful partnerships and collaborations to pursue additional partnerships that will help provide us the experience we need to bring Anticalin based drug candidates to market in a number of indications. We intend to engage with partners for many of our programs in a combination of geographic and indication-based arrangements to maximize our business opportunities. We also intend to retain certain development and commercial rights on selected products as our experience in drug development grows. Key elements of our strategy include: 

 | Continue to build our platform by entering into new partnerships and license and collaborative arrangements and advancing our currently partnered programs. We have entered into partnership and collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies in a diverse range of therapeutic areas and geographies. We have active partnerships with global pharmaceutical companies, such as Servier, Sanofi, Daiichi, Roche and Aska. Together with our partners, we intend to advance multiple drug candidates through preclinical studies and to select further drug candidates for clinical development in the future. We will also continue to seek to engage with new pharmaceutical partners that can contribute funding, experience and marketing ability for the successful development and commercialization of our current and future drug candidates.

pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetics. The inhibition of hepcidin and the subsequent change in parameters of iron metabolism such as the increase in serum iron and transferrin saturation confirmed the mode of action of PRS-080. Based on the data obtained a Phase Ib clinical study was initiated in CKD patients and was completed in the first quarter 2017. Data un-blinding and subsequent disclosure is currently planned for the second quarter of 2017. We plan to initiate in the second quarter of 2017 a multi-dose clinical study in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis, which will assess the ability of PRS-080 to elevate hemoglobin over a period of approximately four weeks.

 | Advance PRS-060 through IND-enabling studies and subsequently into first-in-human trial. We have a strong preclinical pipeline of Anticalin drug candidates in diverse indications such as severe asthma (PRS-060) and immuno-oncology (PRS-343). We have formulated PRS-060 for pulmonary delivery by inhalation; have developed a bioprocess that has generated GMP material for use in preclinical safety and tolerability studies and first in human clinical studies. We intend to pursue a first-in-human clinical trial for PRS-060 in 2017.

 | Advance PRS-343 through IND-enabling studies and subsequently into first-in-patient trial. PRS-343 has been advanced through IND-enabling studies in 2016, including preclinical safety and efficacy studies. We intend to file an IND and pursue a Phase I clinical trial in HER2 positive solid tumor for PRS-343 in 2017.

 | Pursue and broaden opportunities for our Anticalin technology. We intend to continue to identify, vet and pursue opportunities to develop novel Anticalin therapeutics for oncology, pulmonary diseases, and a variety of additional diseases, as we continue to improve on the Anticalin platform technology.

 Anticalin platform technology 
 Our platform technology focuses on low molecular-weight Anticalin proteins that bind tightly and specifically to a diverse range of targets. Anticalin proteins are derived from human proteins called lipocalins, which are naturally occurring low-molecular weight human proteins of approximately 18 to 20kDA molecular mass typically found in blood plasma and other bodily fluids. The lipocalin class of proteins defines a group of extracellular specific-binding proteins that, collectively, exhibit extremely high structural homology, yet have an uncharacteristically low amino acid sequence identity (less than 20%), making them attractive templates for amino acid diversification. Lipocalins naturally bind to, store and transport a wide spectrum of molecules. The defining attributes of the 12-member human lipocalin class and, by extension, Anticalin proteins, engineered from the lipocalin class of proteins, are a four-loop variable region and a rigidly conserved beta-barrel backbone, which, together, form a cup-like binding pocket. The graphic below shows both tear (left) and NGAL (right) lipocalins together with their natural ligands. 
 

Anticalin proteins are created from either tear lipocalin, found in human tear fluid, or NGAL lipocalin, a protein involved in the innate immune system, by making discreet mutations in the genetic code for the binding regions. These mutations have the potential to lead to highly specific, high-affinity binding for both small and large molecular targets. Random mutations are introduced at pre-defined positions involved in endogenous ligand engagement, creating exponentially diverse pools of Anticalin proteins, the most potent and well behaved of 
 
8 
 
 which are selected and optimized in a customized manner through in vitro selection. Using techniques such as phage display, a successful technique in antibody-based drug discovery, to build and refine antibody libraries, the ability to introduce diversity and then select for the best binders among a large pool of Anticalin proteins gives us the opportunity to select Anticalin proteins for a wide variety of targets. The flexibility inherent in the Anticalin proteins cup-like structure allows us to choose both small-molecule targets that fit inside the cup as well as larger protein targets that can be bound by the Anticalin proteins outward-facing arms. Our Phase Ia trial for PRS-080 indicated that Anticalin proteins may be non-immunogenic and thereby have the potential to exhibit a favorable safety profile. 
 The below graphic demonstrates Anticalin drug candidates binding to a small molecule (left), a small protein target (hepcidin, center) and a large protein target (CTLA4, right): 
 

To obtain a specific Anticalin protein, we take advantage of the breadth of our proprietary Anticalin libraries, generated through our protein engineering expertise. We have created, and will continue to create, proprietary Anticalin libraries by rationally diversifying the lipocalin regions that are responsible for ligand binding, applying different libraries to different types of targets. By utilizing bacterial production from the earliest stages of drug discovery through Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, manufacturing, we have created a seamless platform that improves the quality, yield and cost-effectiveness of our drug candidates. However, Anticalin protein manufacturing is not limited to bacterial systems, with the underlying expression system being driven on a program-by-program basis. See Manufacturing below. 
 As targeted, protein-based molecules, Anticalin proteins also function similarly to monoclonal antibodies, thereby offering many of the same favorable qualities, including: 
 

 | High specificity to their targets. Like monoclonal antibodies, Anticalin proteins can bind their targets without binding other molecules, even molecules with very similar chemical structures or amino acid sequences, allowing for more effective treatments through, for example, minimizing off-target effects.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Tight binding and effective biological activity at their targets. Like monoclonal antibodies, Anticalin proteins are able to bind their targets at subnanomolar affinities. Anticalin proteins can potentially achieve desirable biological effects by inhibiting an undesired or inducing a desired cell activity by binding to cell-surface receptors or their ligands.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Human origin. Like many monoclonal antibodies in development and marketed today, Anticalin proteins are derived from a natural class of circulating human proteins. Their human origin increases the likelihood that Anticalin proteins will not be recognized as foreign by the immune system and subsequently rejected.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Scalability for large-scale production. Like monoclonal antibodies, Anticalin proteins lend themselves to large-scale production, yet can also be produced in a range of expression systems ranging from prokaryotic (bacterial) to eukaryotic (animal, plant, fungal) cells. Anticalin proteins can take advantage of several well-understood and widely practiced methods of protein production both in small amounts for preclinical testing and at larger scale for clinical trials and commercial production.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9 
 
While often compared to monoclonal antibodies, Anticalin proteins, we believe, offer several advantages over antibodies, including: 
 

 | Small size and biophysical stability. Anticalin proteins are small in size and are monomeric. Therefore, we believe Anticalins are generally more stable biophysically than tetrameric monoclonal antibodies, which will potentially enable unique routes of administration to target diseases, such as pulmonary delivery. Higher-molecular-weight entities such as antibodies are often too large to be delivered effectively through these methods. We believe Anticalin proteins will also be less expensive to manufacture than antibodies due to their lower molecular weight and less bulky structure as well as the ability to use the prokaryotic-based manufacturing systems, a less costly manufacturing system than mammalian cell-based manufacturing systems, to create them.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Optimization of half-life. Anticalin proteins can be engineered to have a half-life that is optimal for the indication area and a desired dosing schedule. Antibodies typically have half-lives of two weeks or longer, whereas Anticalin proteins can be engineered to have half-lives from hours to weeks, depending on the half-life extension technology employed, if any. This optionality allows us to exert greater control over the amount of circulating Anticalin protein in the blood and the amount of time such Anticalin proteins circulate in the blood, depending on the underlying biology we are trying to address.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Modular platform for higher-order multispecificity and avoidance of cross-linking. Our Anticalin technology is modular, allowing for monovalent or multivalent target engagement, including multispecificity within a single protein. We believe that a monovalent backbone is an advantage in situations where pure antagonism of certain cellular receptors is desired. The dual-binding nature of monoclonal antibodies, which have two arms, can be a disadvantage in cases when the antibodies bind to and cross-link cell-surface receptors. Such cross-linking often leads to undesirable activation of the cells bearing those receptors. Single-action (monovalent) Anticalin proteins have only a single binding site and are thus not subject to cross-linking. Further, when it is called for by the biology we are addressing, we can create multispecific Anticalin proteins that can simultaneously bind (i) two or more different targets or (ii) different epitopes, the specific piece of an antigen to which an antibody binds, on the same target by genetically linking Anticalin proteins with distinct specificities on a common cDNA strand. We believe this multispecificity offers advantages in biological settings where binding to multiple targets can enhance the ability of a drug to achieve its desired effects, such as killing cancer cells. Unique Anticalin proteins can be pieced together and undergo simultaneous target engagement as a single fusion protein, without generally compromising on manufacturability.

Implementation of our Anticalin Platform Technology: Our Drug Candidates Pipeline 
Each of our drug candidates is in the early stage of development, and we anticipate that it will likely be several years before any of our drug candidates could be commercialized. The following table summarizes the status of our current drug candidates and programs: 
 

PRS-080 targeting hepcidin in CKD-related FID-anemia 
 PRS-080 is an Anticalin drug candidate targeting hepcidin, a peptide mediator that is an important negative regulator of iron absorption and storage, derived from the naturally occurring human lipocalin known as NGAL. The normal function of hepcidin is to maintain equilibrium in iron supply for red blood cell production by binding to ferroportin, the protein that transports iron from the inside of a cell to the outside, inducing its internalization and subsequent degradation. The binding of hepcidin to ferroportin reduces the iron uptake from the intestine into the body and inhibits iron mobilization from cellular stores into red blood cells. An excess amount of hepcidin can cause FID, which often cannot be treated adequately with iron supplements and can lead to anemia. According to a 2009 publication by Young and Zaritsky in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, lowering hepcidin levels or antagonizing its actions would reverse the negative effects of inflammation on red blood cell formation by allowing mobilization of stored iron and improved iron absorption. 
 PRS-080 has been designed to target hepcidin for the treatment of FID in anemic patients with CKD, particularly in end-stage renal disease patients requiring dialysis, to allow them to mobilize iron that is trapped in iron storage cells for use in the creation of red blood cells. We have also engineered PRS-080 to have a half-life of less than a week, so that following administration, it is expected to clear from the human body in a much shorter timeframe than antibodies, which typically have a half-life of two weeks or greater. This half-life was achieved by covalently linking PRS-080 to a specific polyethylene glycol, or PEG, in order to extend the serum half-life of the combined molecule to desirable levels. Since hepcidin is constantly produced by the body, we believe that a frequent, e.g. once per week, dosing interval will be optimally suited to interfere with hepcidin function. A half-life of about three days and a shorter residence time than mAbs is then in turn more compatible with the dosing schedule. A longer mAb-like residence time is not seen as advantageous, but rather could lead to the accumulation of both the drug and the target beyond the typical residence time of hepcidin, resulting in large quantities of hepcidin bound to mAbs. We completed a Phase Ia single-ascending dose clinical trial with PRS-080 in healthy volunteers in 2015. The trial was conducted in accordance with German law at a clinical site in Neu-Ulm, Germany, that belongs to Nuvisan GmbH, our contract research organization, or CRO. Results from this trial were presented at the 2015 Annual Conference of the American Society of Hematology (http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/126/23/536). Based on the data obtained we initiated a Phase Ib clinical study in CKD 5 patients requiring hemodialysis which we completed in February 2017. Data un-blinding and 
 
11 
 
 subsequent disclosure is currently planned for the second quarter of 2017. The company plans to initiate a multi-dose clinical study in CKD patients requiring hemodialysis in the second quarter of 2017, which will assess the ability of PRS-080 to elevate hemoglobin over a period of approximately four weeks. 
 Chronic kidney disease 
 According to the American Kidney Fund, approximately 31 million individuals in the United States have CKD (Stages 1-5). The proportion of CKD patients with anemia increases with the severity and stage of CKD. However, according to a September 2013 competitive landscape report conducted by Tech Atlas Group, overall rates of individuals with anemia among the CKD population are approximately 30%, and according to a 2004 study by McClellan et al., Current Medical Research and Opinion, approximately 47% of the CKD patients studied were found to be anemic. Extrapolating these percentages based on the CKD population of 31 million individuals. We believe that approximately 9.3 to 14.6 million individuals with CKD in the United States are anemic. CKD (Stage 5), also known as End-Stage Renal Disease, or ESRD, is the final stage of chronic kidney disease with approximately 640,000 patients in the U.S. as of December 31, 2012 according the U.S. Renal Data System, USRDS 2014 Annual Data Report. The Tech Atlas Group report also estimates that approximately 70%, or approximately 450,000, of CKD (Stage 5) patients suffer from anemia. Anemia related to CKD is currently treated by injectable recombinant protein erythropoiesis, (red blood cell production) stimulating agents, or rESAsincluding Epogen, Aranesp, and Procritoften combined with iron supplementation and/or a red blood cell transfusion. Based on the reported revenues of companies that market and sell rESAs, we believe that global sales of injectable rESAs were $6.3 billion in 2012, the vast majority of which were for renal indications. 
 Anemia and functional iron deficiency in the CKD population 
 Anemia is a serious medical condition in which blood is deficient in red blood cells, and hemoglobin, leading to inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues and cells throughout the body. Anemia is generally said to exist when hemoglobin is less than 13 g/dL in men and 12 g/dL in women. Anemia has a number of potential causes, including nutritional deficiencies, iron deficiency, bone marrow disease, medications, and abnormalities in production of or sensitivity to erythropoietin, a hormone that controls red blood cell production. Anemia is a frequent and severe consequence of CKD. In addition, within the CKD population, anemia may be caused by FID. FID exists when, despite adequate stores, iron cannot be mobilized for erythropoiesis. In this case, despite treatment with exogenous erythropoietin and iron supplements, functional iron is still deficient. FID-anemic patients can be identified and selected for therapy using marketed laboratory tests for iron metabolism. The USRDS 2014 Annual Data Report estimates that as of 2012, approximately 409,000 individuals with ESRD are presently on hemodialysis. According to the results of a 2013 research analysis conducted for us by Artisan Healthcare Consulting, which, among other things, pooled research results from nephrologists in the United States, approximately 82% of the hemodialysis patient population are anemic, and that among the anemic hemodialysis patient population, up to 23% are FID-anemic. Based on the estimated 409,000 individuals with ESRD on hemodialysis, we believe that approximately 335,000 ESRD patients on hemodialysis are anemic and approximately 0.08 million individuals are FID-anemic. 
 Untreated anemia is associated with chronic fatigue, increased risk of progression of multiple diseases, and death. These morbidity and mortality risks have been clearly shown in the CKD population, where in patients age 66 and older, anemic patients with mid-stage CKD (Stage 3) have a 149% increase in cardiovascular events, and patients with severe CKD (Stage 4 and 5) have a 24% increase in cardiovascular events, in each case versus non-anemic patients in the same group, according to a paper published in 2006 in the peer-reviewed journal Blood. Similarly, compared to non-anemic patients, anemia increases the mortality rate by 199% in mid-stage CKD, and 59% in severe CKD. Successful treatment of anemia significantly improves patients quality of life, especially with respect to vitality, fatigue and physical function. In addition, patients whose anemia has been successfully treated have demonstrated lower mortality rates, less frequent hospitalization, and decreases in cardiovascular morbidity.

Challenges in using conventional therapy 
 We believe CKD patients with FID-anemia are especially poorly served. These patients have adequate stores of iron but this iron is not efficiently incorporated into red blood cell precursors through rESAs and iron supplements. According to the 2009 publication by Young and Zaritsky in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, this imbalance in iron metabolism is a result of a high level of circulating hepcidin in the blood stream. We believe existing therapies are limited in that they do not have an impact on hepcidin or, in the case of rESAs, patients often become resistant to the therapy. 
 Our potential solution: binding hepcidin with PRS-080 
 We have engineered PRS-080 so that it binds to hepcidin and reduces the impact of hepcidins negative regulation on iron mobilization. We believe that by blocking the actions of hepcidin, PRS-080 will serve to address anemia by mobilizing iron for incorporation into red blood cells. 
 In patients suffering from anemia of CKD, and specifically in patients with FID, hepcidin is chronically produced by the body in abnormally large amounts. Therefore, we believe that the best way to inhibit its function is to administer an inhibitor on a repeated basis, such as once a week. Our approach will use PRS-080 in connection with a conjugated PEG30 molecule, a well-known half-life extender, in order to allow the drug sufficient residence time in the body. Once coupled to PEG30, PRS-080 is intended to have a half-life that will be optimally suited for dosing anemic patients with CKD. In contrast, antibodies typically have a half-life of two to three weeks. Such a long half-life renders antibodies unsuitable for frequent administration and elimination of a circulating target protein like hepcidin because such antibodies tend to accumulate the target after binding due to their own long residence time in the body with the associated risk of bound hepcidin being released by antibodies that are still circulating in the blood. 
 Preclinical data 
 Our preclinical studies targeted the cynomolgus monkey orthologue of hepcidin, which has a high degree of similarity (96% identity) with human hepcidin. PRS-080 was found to bind with high affinity to the cynomolgus monkey version of hepcidin. We performed a dose finding study in cynomolgus monkeys, testing intravenous 30-minute infusions as well as subcutaneous injections of PRS-080. We also carried out a 4-week repeated dose toxicology study with intravenous infusions of PRS-080 for 30 minutes every other day. Our work included toxicokinetic and ADA measurements. During the study, safety pharmacology parameters on the cardiovascular system and respiration were monitored and all safety endpoints were met. Our preclinical studies also examined a different NGAL-derived Anticalin, or surrogate molecule, which targets rat hepcidin in a rat model of inflammation-induced anemia. In these studies, administration of the surrogate molecule once per day or every other day inhibited the manifestation of anemia in the rats over the course of a three-week period. 
 Hepcidin binds to ferroportin and induces its internalization and subsequent degradation, thus disabling iron mobilization from cells. PRS-080 binds strongly to hepcidin and inhibits its activity as shown in potency assays. These in vitro potency studies showed that the hepcidin-induced internalization of ferroportin is inhibited by PRS-080 in a dose-dependent manner. PRS-080 allowed for the restoration of ferroportin expression, overcoming the hepcidin-induced down-regulation, whereas NGAL alone did not have a similar effect on ferroportin expression.

The below chart demonstrates the percentage of expression of ferroportin, % FPN1, by PRS-080 mediated inhibition of hepcidin in an in vitro potency assay with ferroportin transfected 293 cells, wherein at 20 nM, hepcidin induces internalization of ferroportin which is reversed by PRS-080 in a dose dependent manner: 
 

We then studied the functional consequences of hepcidin inhibition on iron mobilization in cynomolgus monkeys. A dose of 1 mg/kg PRS-080 produced a robust, transient and reversible increase in total iron levels from approximately 36 µM at baseline to 52 µM after 8 hours. Doses higher than 1 mg/kg elevated serum iron concentrations to comparable levels and, in a dose-dependent manner, prolonged the response. A linear correlation was observed over time between the PRS-080 dose and increase of serum iron concentrations. 
 The below chart shows the increase in serum iron concentrations in cynomolgus monkeys following a single intravenous administration of PRS-080 at 10 mg/kg compared to wild-type NGAL administered at the same dose:

The functional consequence of PRS-080 treatment on bone marrow activity and red blood cell production, or hematopoiesis, by means of hemoglobin (an oxygen transporting protein contained in red blood cells) concentration in reticulocytes, a precursor of red blood cells, was investigated in cynomolgus monkeys following repeated administration. As shown in the below chart, after administration of PRS-080 either intravenously (i.v. 150 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (s.c. 20 mg/kg), elevated hemoglobin concentrations in reticulocytes (Retic CH) were observed on day 30 compared to pre-treatment (pre-dose). 
 

The PK properties of PRS-080 were investigated in cynomolgus monkeys after a single administration at doses ranging from 20 mg/kg to 150 mg/kg. The concentration over time profiles of PRS-080 showed standard drug-like properties, as the kinetics were dose proportional and there was a low volume of distribution. Elimination of PRS-080 occurred with a terminal half-life of about 2 days, which can be extrapolated to translate to 3 days in humans. 
 PRS-080 administration to cynomolgus monkeys was well tolerated up to the highest tested dose of 120 mg/kg. This dose was classified as producing no adverse events: routine laboratory tests and blood cell examinations did not demonstrate any adverse findings and safety pharmacology investigations were without adverse events. As a result of the hepcidin inhibition, the study showed increased iron uptake and storage, for example in the liver, and mobilization. 
 Phase I trial design and results 
 The Phase Ia trial of PRS-080 was conducted in healthy volunteers at a clinical site in Neu-Ulm, Germany by Nuvisan GmbH, a CRO. The study was a single dose escalating, blinded, placebo controlled study at a dose range from 0.2 to 40 mg/kg (equivalent to 0.08 to 16.0 mg/kg based on protein content). Forty-eight subjects were dosed with PRS-080 or a placebo. This study was governed and approved by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, or BfArM) and the local Ethics Committee. Treatment of subjects began at the end of 2014 and was completed in June 2015, followed by evaluation of the data. 
 
15 
 
PRS-080 was well tolerated. All treatment emergent Adverse Events, or AEs, were either mild or moderate and no Serious AEs were observed. No association of AEs to specific organs and no apparent dose dependency or difference between placebo and active treatment was observed. Notably, no hypersensitivity or infusion reactions were noted and vital signs, body temperature and electrocardiograms were unchanged. Pharmacokinetics of PRS were dose-proportional with a half-life of approximately 3 days. PRS-080 administration resulted in an immediate decrease in plasma hepcidin concentration, which was followed by an increase in serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation. As shown in the figure below, the duration of this response in iron and transferrin saturation increased dose-dependently from about 25 hours at the lower dose to about 185 hours at the highest dose. 
 

Phase Ib trial in anemic CKD 5 patient 
 Based on this positive safety and pharmacological activity we initiated a Phase lb study in CKD 5 patients undergoing hemodialysis and suffering from FID-anemia earlier in 2016. This study was completed in the first quarter of 2017. Results will be available in the second quarter of 2017. Patients are being treated with a single PRS-080 administration at 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg. Safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological activity by means of serum iron and transferrin saturation will be investigated. Subsequently, we plan to investigate repeated administrations of PRS-080 in a Phase 2a study to investigate the effects of hepcidin inhibition and iron mobilization on hemoglobin levels in CKD patients. This Phase 2a study is planned to start in the second quarter of 2017 with results being available by the end of 2017. 
 PRS-343 targeting CD-137 in oncology 
 PRS-343 is a bispecific protein targeting the immune receptor CD137 and the tumor target HER2. It is generated by genetic fusion of an Anticalin specific for CD137 with a variant of the HER2-targeting antibody trastuzumab. The mode of action of this CD137/HER2 bispecific is to promote CD137 clustering by bridging CD137-positive T cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a potent costimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells. PRS-343 is intended to localize CD137 activation in the tumor, and to thereby both increase efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity compared to CD137-targeting antibodies being developed by third parties in clinical trials. PRS-343 has been advanced through IND-enabling studies in 2016, including preclinical safety and efficacy studies were performed. We have completed a Master Cell bank was generated and GMP material to support initial clinical trials. We intend to file an IND and pursue a Phase I clinical trial in HER2 positive solid tumor for PRS-343 in the first half of 2017. 
 Biology of the costimulatory immune receptor CD137 
 CD137, also known as 4-1BB, is a co-stimulatory immune receptor and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor, or TNFR, super-family. It is mainly expressed on activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, activated B cells, and natural killer, or NK, cells. CD137 plays an important role in the regulation of immune responses and thus is 
 
16 
 
 a target for cancer immunotherapy. CD137 ligand (CD137L) is the only known natural ligand of CD137, and is constitutively expressed on several types of antigen-presenting cells, or APC. CD137-positive T cells are activated by engaging a CD137L-positive cell. The induced CD137 clustering leads to activation of the receptor and downstream signaling. Note that the trimeric CD137L as a soluble molecule is not an effective CD137 agonist, providing evidence that larger scale clustering is required for activation. In a T cell pre-stimulated by the T cell receptor binding to a cognate Major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, target, costimulation via CD137 leads to further enhanced activation, survival and proliferation, as well as the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an improved capacity to kill. 
 Validation of CD137 as a therapeutic target in cancer 
 The benefit of CD137 costimulation for the elimination of cancerous tumors has been demonstrated in a number of in vivo models in the mouse. The forced expression of CD137L on a tumor, for example, leads to tumor rejection. Likewise, the forced expression of an anti-CD137 single chain antibody fragment (scFv) on a tumor leads to a CD4+ T-cell and NK-cell dependent elimination of the tumor. A systemically administered anti-CD137 antibody has also been demonstrated to lead to retardation of tumor growth. 
 Human ex vivo data support the extraordinary potential of CD137 as a costimulatory receptor in cancer therapy: It has been reported that for T cells isolated from human tumors, CD137 is an effective marker for those that are tumor-reactive. Based on this observation, we believe anti-CD137 antibodies can be utilized to improve adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) by augmenting the expansion and activity of CD8+ melanoma tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. 
 Finally, the potential of CD137 targeting has also been shown in nonclinical combination therapy studies, where an additional benefit was demonstrated by combination of CD137 agonism with checkpoint blockade or NK cell-targeting antibodies. 
 Current approaches to clinical CD137 targeting 
 The preclinical demonstration of the potential therapeutic benefit of CD137 costimulation has spurred the development of therapeutic antibodies targeting CD137, PF-05082566 (22, 23) and BMS-663513, which are currently in early phase clinical trials. 
 PF-05082566 is a fully humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds CD137 in a manner that blocks the binding of endogenous CD137L to CD137, and that according to publicly available data is well tolerated as a monotherapy and in combination with rituximab. 
 BMS-663513 is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that, in contrast to PF-05082566, binds CD137 in a manner that does not interfere with the CD137 / CD137L interaction. While an initial trial reported manageable toxicity with doses up to 10mg/kg, a follow-up monotherapy phase II trial was reported to have been stopped due to an unusually high incidence of grade 4 hepatitis. Current clinical trials with BMS-663513 are focusing on safety and efficacy at lower doses as monotherapy or in combination e.g. with Rituximab (NCT01775631). 
 Rationale for bispecific targeting of CD137 
 We believe that the natural mode of activation of CD137, which requires receptor clustering, demonstrates that an ideal CD137-targeting agent should firstly lead to clustering of CD137, and secondly do so in a tumor-localized fashion on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TIL. The antibodies currently in clinical development are not ideal in that respect, as CD137 clustering can only be induced by binding to Fcg receptor-positive cells, which are not selectively tumor-localized but distributed throughout the body for Fcg-dependence of TNFR targeting). The toxicity data of BMS-663513 indicates that such a non-selective activation leads to unacceptable toxicity, potentially making it impossible to find a therapeutic window for such CD137-targeting antibodies. 
 
17 
 
We therefore hypothesized that to obtain an ideal CD137-targeting agent, a bispecific molecule should be designed that targets CD137 on one end and a differentially expressed tumor target on the other end. A visualization of the general concept is provided in Figure 1, below.HER2/CD137 bispecific is envisioned to promote CD137 clustering by bridging T cells with HER2-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a potent costimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells, further enhancing its T cell receptor, or TCR,-mediated activity and leading to tumor destruction. 
 



Figure 1 | Concept of costimulatory T cell engagement. (A) The elements of the system are a target-positive tumor cell, a T cell with a TCR that is specific for an HLA/peptide combination on the tumor, and a costimulatory bispecific. (B) Within a patient´s tumor, tumor-specific T cells are bridged with tumor cells by a costimulatory bispecific. The resulting clustering of the costimulatory T cell receptor provides a local co-activating signal to the T cell, further enhancing its TCR-mediated activity and leading to tumor destruction. (C) Toxic side effects are expected to be manageable, as target-negative cells do not lead to costimulation of T cells due to a lack of target-mediated receptor clustering, and healthy tissue is spared by tumor-costimulated T cells due to the absence of a primary, TCR-mediated signal. Design and Generation of HER2/CD137 bispecific PRS-343
---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To obtain a molecule that would work by the mode of action of costimulatory T cell engagement, we generated the HER2/CD137 bispecific PRS-343. The molecule consists of two different building blocks binding to the two targets HER2 and CD137. To generate the CD137-specific building block of PRS-343, termed S0575.04J10, we utilized anticalin technology. This technology works by engineering lipocalins to bind any desired target protein with high affinity and specificity, in a manner very similar to antibodies. The lipocalin family comprises a diverse group of mostly secreted soluble proteins that bind, store and transport a broad spectrum of molecules, ranging from small molecules to proteins. Lipocalins are structurally related by possessing an 8-stranded beta-barrel structure. Lipocalin-2, also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, or NGAL, is a component of granules in neutrophils and is up-regulated during inflammation. The primary function of NGAL appears to be the sequestering of bacterial siderophores (iron chelators), leading to an inhibition of bacterial growth. A CD137-binding anticalin was generated based on a re-design of the natural binding pocket of NGAL using mutant anticalin libraries and a selection and screening process. The CD137-binding anticalin S0575.04J10 binds human 
 
18 
 
 CD137 with an affinity of 2 nM as determined by SPR, and is capable of costimulating human T cells when immobilized on a plastic dish together with an anti-CD3 antibody. 
 To generate the HER2/CD137 bispecific PRS-343, we constructed a genetic fusion of the CD137-specific anticalin S0575.04J10 to the C-terminus of the heavy chain of the trastuzumab IgG4 variant, connected by a flexible, non-immunogenic linker sequence of 15 amino acids length. 
 We utilized a Sandwich ELISA experiment to investigate whether PRS-343 can bind both targets at the same time, which is a necessary prerequisite for the envisioned mode of action of PRS-343. Figure below shows that a sigmoid binding curve results from this titration, proving that both targets can indeed be engaged at the same time, fulfilling the key requirement for simultaneous costimulatory engagement of T cells by HER2-positive target cells. 
 



Figure 2 | PRS-343 simultaneous binding to targets HER2 and CD137. Recombinant Her2 was coated on a microtiter plate, followed by titration of PRS-343. Subsequently, a constant concentration of biotinylated human CD137 was added, which was detected via a peroxidase-conjugated avidin variant, ExtrAvidin®.
---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Mode of action  costimulatory T cell activation 
 We developed a novel T cell activation assay format to investigate whether PRS-343 is capable of costimulating T cells that have received a basic stimulus via the TCR. The assay, visualized in Figure 3 below, is based upon providing the T cell receptor stimulus via an anti-CD3 antibody coated onto the plastic culture dish, while CD137 costimulation is achieved by tumor-target dependent clustering of CD137 on purified T cells.

Figure 3 | Visualization of costimulatory T cell activation assay. HER2-positive tumor cells are grown overnight on cell culture plates that have been precoated with low amounts of an anti-CD3 antibody to provide a limited primary activation of T cells via the T cell receptor. T cells are added to the wells together with the titrated CD137/HER2 bispecific PRS-343, leading to clustering of the costimulatory CD137 receptor, which in turn results in T cell costimulation. T cell costimulation is detected by increased supernatant IL-2 and IFN-g levels in the culture supernatants after continued culture.
---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There is a clear induction of IL-2 (Figure A) and IFN- g (Figure C) with increasing concentrations of PRS-343. The fitted EC50 of this effect is similar for both proinflammatory cytokines, with 0.7 nM for IL-2 induction and 0.3 nM for IFN-g induction, respectively. That T cell costimulation is indeed, due to the bispecific engagement of T cells and SKBR3 cells, shown by two observations: firstly, the monospecific antibody trastuzumab does not lead to enhanced T cell activation (average shown as dotted line in Figure A and Figure C), and secondly, disrupting the bispecific interaction with an excess of trastuzumab abolishes the effect of IL-2 and INF-g induction almost completely, except at the highest concentrations of PRS-343 employed (Figure B and Figure D). 
 



Figure 4 | Experimental result of costimulatory T cell activation assay. HER2-positive SKBR3 tumor cells were grown overnight on 96-well plates that had been precoated with 0.25 µg/mL anti-CD3 antibody for 1 h at 37°C. The next day, T cells purified from healthy donor PBMC were added to the wells together with the titrated CD137/HER2 bispecific PRS-343 (filled circle) or trastuzumab as a control (dotted line). After three days in culture, IL-2 (A) and IFN-g, levels in the culture supernatants were

measured by an Electrochemoluminescence immunoassay. In parallel, the experiment was performed in the presence of an excess of trastuzumab (340 nM) to inhibit the binding of PRS-343 to the SKBR3 cells, and IL-2 (C) and IFN-g (D) levels were measured.

 PRS-060 targeting IL-4RA in asthma 
 PRS-060 is an Anticalin drug candidate targeting IL-4RA, a cell surface receptor expressed on immune cells in the lung epithelium and sub-mucosal layer. IL-4RA is specific to the circulating cytokine IL-4 and the closely related cytokine IL-13, both key drivers of the immune system that induce differentiation of naïve helper T cells to type 2 helper T cells, or Th2. PRS-060 is derived from human tear lipocalin, has picomolar affinity for human IL-4RA (20 pM) and has a favorable stability profile. We showed in vitro that PRS-060 can inhibit the activity of both IL-4 and IL-13. We have formulated PRS-060 for pulmonary delivery by inhalation, and we have developed a bioprocess that has generated GMP material for use in preclinical safety and tolerability studies and First in Human clinical studies. Pending the results of our preclinical studies, we intend to pursue a first-in-human clinical trial for PRS-060 in 2017. Some of the development of PRS-060 is conducted in Australia, where we intend to access leading pulmonologists for potential patient recruitment and to seek up to 40% or more in tax refunds from the Australian government in connection with research and development expenses related to PRS-060. We believe PRS-060 represents a first in class inhaled biologic for the treatment of asthma. 
 Asthma market 
 Asthma is a very common chronic airway disorder affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide according to the Global Initiative for Asthma and approximately 26 million Americans according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Of these 26 million, about 7 million are children. Asthma is responsible for 13 million physician visits a year including about 2 million emergency visits in the United States, according to the American Lung Association. In 2007 asthma was responsible for $50 billion in direct healthcare costs each year in the United States (Barnett and Nurmagambetov, 2011, Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Volume 127, pp145-152). 
 Challenges in using conventional therapy 
 According to a 2012 Artisan Health Care Consulting analysis, asthma affects approximately 195 million people in the U.S., Europe, Japan, Brazil, Russia, India and China. The analysis determined that approximately 16%, or 32 million, of the group studied were considered to have moderate and severe uncontrolled asthma, while approximately 60%, or 19 million, of the group of moderate and severe uncontrolled asthma studied were considered to have moderate and severe uncontrolled asthma with an elevated Th2 signature. In the majority of patients, inflammation brought about by Th2 immunity is addressed by standard asthma therapies. However, 5-10% of patients with asthma have moderate to severe disease that is not controlled with these standard of care therapies. 
 The current standard of care for persistent, moderate to severe allergic asthma is high dose inhaled corticosteroids or ICS often in combination with inhaled long-acting beta-adrenergic agonists, or LABA. In very severe allergic asthma, omalizumab (Xolair from Roche) is given to patients in addition to ICS/LABA combinations. Omalizumab was approved for this condition in the United States in 2003. Outside of the United States, omalizumab is approved for severe asthma. Omalizumab works by binding to the immune mediator immunoglobulin E, or IgE, and inhibiting IgE-mediated activation of mast cells and basophils, types of white blood cells. It has also been shown to impact some diseases, such as asthma, that are driven by eosinophils, another important class of immune cells. However, patient response to omalizumab has been shown to be inconsistent, as reported in a publication by McNicholl and Heaney in 2008 in the journal Core Evidence, which explained that in only some studies did omalizumab improve lung function. Furthermore, general asthma symptoms are also typically unaffected by omalizumab. Finally, in 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, issued a black box warning for omalizumab due to reported cases of anaphylaxis, a 
 
21 
 
 potentially life-threatening allergic reaction suffered by some patients who had taken the drug. Despite these shortcomings, in 2012, worldwide sales of omalizumab were reported by Roche to be $1.2 billion. 
 The next generation of therapies beyond omalizumab targets a broader range than just IgE mediated mechanisms. These approaches target other immune mediators, including IL-4, IL-13, Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin or TSLP, IL-33 (which act in concert on eosinophils, B-cells, epithelial cells, goblet cells and others) and PGD2 (through stimulation of CRTH2 receptors). Asthma is associated with high levels of eosinophils, immune cells that play a role in protecting the body against infection. The creation of eosinophils can be interrupted at the early stages, while the cells are still maturing. Multiple products are in development that target eosinophils and GlaxoSmithKlines, or GSK, mepolizumab (Nucala) which targets IL-5 was approved for severe eosinophilic asthma in adults and children older than 12 in 2015. However, eosinophils are only one of many cell types and immune system components that are involved with the bodys exaggerated inflammation response in asthma. Mast cells, basophils, goblet cells and other cells also play a role. These cells can be seen infiltrating the airways along with eosinophils, leading to the conclusion that more cell types are involved in asthma pathogenesis. We believe that targeting just one of these components unlikely to be as effective in treating severe asthma as an approach that targets the broader Th2 (cell-mediated) pathway. 
 In 2013, Regeneron and its partner Sanofi reported proof-of-concept in a Phase IIa trial in persistent asthma with dupilumab, a currently unapproved monoclonal antibody that targets IL-4RA now in clinical development as a subcutaneously delivered agent. In a 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine, Wenzel et al. reported that dupilumab showed a benefit on the asthma control questionnaire 5 (ACQ5) symptom score, a widely accepted measure for classifying the ability of a medication to control asthma. Patients dosed with dupilumab had fewer asthma attacks compared to placebo-treated patients when standard therapies, such as long-acting beta-agonists and inhaled glucocorticoids, were withdrawn, demonstrating the efficacy of dupilumab. Patients also showed improved lung function and reduced levels of Th2-associated inflammatory markers. Dupilumab is administered systemically through injection. In November 2014, Regeneron and Sanofi announced that in a Phase IIb study, dupilumab also demonstrated improved lung function and reduced exacerbations when administered together with standard of care. These effects were observed in both unselected severe asthma patients and selected patients presenting elevated Th2 responses. We believe the results support the possibility of treating persistent uncontrolled asthma with a biologic therapy without narrowing the patient population based on the Th2 phenotype. Dupilumab is currently undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials for severe asthma. 
 Another biologic that was in development for severe asthma was lebrikizumab, which blocks the effects of IL-13, a mechanism known to have a similar effect to that of dupilumab. Like dupilumab and other mediators of the Th2 pathway, lebrikizumab is a validating example for subcutaneously delivered Th2 intervention in treating uncontrolled asthmatics. In a 2011 publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, lebrikizumab was reported to improve lung function in severe asthma patients who were also receiving standard of care inhaled glucocorticoid therapy. However, despite these positive effects, in Phase 3 trials lebrikizumab failed to meet its primary endpoint of reducing asthma exacerbations in one of the two Phase 3 studies performed. We believe that there could also be significant advantages to other routes of administration, such as inhalation, of biologics that target asthma through the Th2 pathway. If delivered by inhalation, such biologics could be dosed at much lower levels and may preferentially direct the therapy to the site of the disease, in this case the lung. 
 Our proposed solution: binding IL-4RA with PRS-060 
 We propose to take PRS-060 forward into clinical trials first in healthy volunteers and then in moderate to severe asthma patients. These trials could accomplish two important goals: we could establish proof-of-concept for inhaled Anticalin proteins, opening up a second route of administration for our drug candidates beyond intravenous or subcutaneous injection. Following the demonstration that inhaled PRS-060 is well tolerated in healthy volunteers, we plan to perform a proof-of-concept trial in asthma patients who are uncontrolled on standard of care therapy (ICS/LABA combinations), where we will evaluate whether PRS-060 can improve lung function and asthma symptoms. We intend to begin a Phase I clinical trial for PRS-060 in the second half of 2017. 
 
22 
 
Advantages to inhalation as a route of administration for PRS-060 
 We have performed inhalation studies in mice and observed that systemic concentrations of PRS-060 are minimal when dosed by inhalation, this is because of low doses required for efficacy and short systemic residence time. This offers the potential of a wider therapeutic window and possibly lower systemic side effects that may become increasingly prevalent with chronic, systemic Th2 targeting. By our calculations, the total annual dose of PRS-060 can be significantly lower than the doses being used for the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) dupilumab and lebrikizumab. Furthermore, we believe that PRS-060 can be produced at a lower cost of goods than mAbs because we intend to use manufacturing procedures that employ bacterial expression systems, which generally provides a cost advantage over mammalian production systems, typically used for mAbs. Since dosing by inhalation is a common route of administration in asthma patients, it represents a more convenient dosage regimen for patients than dosing of antibodies by injection. PRS-060 would therefore be self-administered using a standard device rather than requiring a visit to a physician for the drug to be given. 
 Preclinical data 
 In in vitro assays, PRS-060 specifically bound to immobilized targets such as human IL-4RA in a concentration-dependent manner. We tested the binding of PRS-060 to various targets in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or the ELISA, a standard in vitro assay platform. In these tests, PRS-060 bound to IL-4RA with subnanomolar affinity and it did not bind to three other human cell-surface interleukin receptors (IL-6R, IL-18RA, IL-23RA). Furthermore, the activity of IL-4 and IL-13 was inhibited by PRS-060 in a dose-dependent manner. The below charts below show the inhibition of IL-4 (left) or IL-13 (right) induced proliferation in human TF-1 cells in vitro by PRS-060. 
 

In in vivo assays in mice genetically altered to express human IL-4RA, human IL-4 and IL-13, low doses of PRS-060 inhibited the induction of eotaxin protein, a marker or airway inflammation, in lung tissue following pulmonary delivery. We observed this inhibition at both the RNA and protein levels compared both to buffer and to tear lipocalin. 
 
23 
 
The below chart shows the duration of PRS-060-mediated inhibition of eotaxin gene expression, a marker of airway inflammation, in lung tissue by a single pulmonary dose in mice: 
 

When we administered IL-13 into the lung, inflammation was induced as determined by eotaxin expression, which was not inhibited when phosphate buffered saline, or PBS, or human Wild Type lipocalin was administered into the lung. In contrast to the PBS administration, increases in eotaxin expression were prevented when PRS-060 was administered into the lung before IL-13. As demonstrated in the above chart, the model showed the inhibitory potential lasts for up to 24 hours after PRS-060 administration. 
 PRS-332 targeting an undisclosed checkpoint target 
 PRS-332 is a bispecific anticalin-antibody fusion protein comprising an anti-PD-1 antibody genetically fused to an Anticalin targeting an undisclosed checkpoint target. Other drug candidates targeting the checkpoint molecule PD-1 include nivolumab, marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb (trade name Opdivo), and pembrolizumab, traded by Merck, (trade name Keytruda). Anti-PD-1 antibodies have demonstrated great clinical benefit in several cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck carcinomas. However, there are many patients who do not respond, relapse or acquire resistance to PD-1 treatment. In order to improve on existing PD-1 therapies, Pieris is developing PRS-332 with the intent to simultaneously block PD-1 and another immune checkpoint co-expressed on exhausted T cells. 
 Pipeline products: 300 Series 
 Current antibody-based therapies targeting tumor cell destruction or immune activation are hampered by, among other factors, low response rates and the induction of immune-related adverse events. The 300-Series Anticalin proteins are designed to target checkpoint proteins or, like PRS-343, immune-stimulatory proteins and consist of a variety of multifunctional biotherapeutics that can combine, via a genetic fusion, antibodies with Anticalin proteins or two or more Anticalin proteins to each other. These combined molecules have the potential to build upon current therapies through the capability of modifying or regulating one or more immune functions on a single fusion protein, thereby having the potential to elevate immune responses within a tumor microenvironment. We believe that a tethered Anticalin protein directed at checkpoint proteins can preferentially activate the immune system at the site of the tumor microenvironment thus providing efficacy with enhanced therapeutic index. We believe that the 300-Series Anticalin proteins represent a platform within a product opportunity in immuno-oncology since it may be possible to apply a single combined Anticalin-antibody molecule in a number of different cancers. This is based on the shared underlying biology such as checkpoint and costimulatory biology found within tumors arising in different organs. 
Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development 
 
24 
 
 experience, scientific knowledge and strategies provide us with competitive advantages, we face and will continue to face intense competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, both in the United States and abroad. 
 We compete, or will compete, with existing and new therapies that may become available in the future. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that our drug candidates target. Any drug candidates that we are able to develop and commercialize will compete with existing and new drugs being developed by our competitors. Our competitors may develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that may be commercialized by us, or may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. 
 The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, some of which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products and many of which are bigger than us and have more institutional experience and greater cash flows than we have, may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product licenses and/or acquisitions. In addition, a number of established research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may acquire products in late stages of development to augment their internal product lines, which may provide those companies with an even greater competitive advantage. 
 There are a number of other companies presently working to develop therapies for anemia, asthma, and oncology, including divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes. There are also a variety of available drug therapies marketed for these diseases. Our drug candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, and to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our drug candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. As a result, market acceptance of, and a significant share of the market for, any of our drug candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. 
 In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of medicines in clinical development to treat anemia, asthma, or cancer. These medicines in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience, and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies and may not be provided by any of our current or future product candidates. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates. 
 Many of our competitors will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in some of our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build, obtain regulatory approval for and market acceptance of, and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy. 
 In addition, our competitors may have a variety of drugs in development or awaiting market approval that could reach the market and become established before we have a product to sell. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Many of our competitors are using technologies or methods different or similar to ours to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small molecule drugs. Many of our competitors and their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do in the following: 
 

 | identifying and validating targets;
--+------------------------------------


 | screening compounds against targets;
--+-------------------------------------

 
25 
 

 | preclinical and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | obtaining regulatory clearances.
--+---------------------------------

 In addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater advantages in the following areas: 
 

 | capital resources;
--+-------------------


 | research and development resources;
--+------------------------------------


 | manufacturing capabilities; and
--+--------------------------------


 | sales and marketing.
--+---------------------

 Smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved by the FDA, or its foreign counterparts, or are in advanced development. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 PRS-080 
 There are very few other drug candidates in development that interfere with hepcidin function or expression. Nucleic acid based approaches that were in preclinical development by IONIS/Xenon and Alnylam have been suspended for unknown reasons. Noxxons RNA aptamer NOX-H94 has completed Phase II clinical studies in cancer and ESRD patients. While an increase of Hb values was seen in cancer patients, no such effect could be confirmed in the ESRD population. PRS-080 is significantly more potent and has a longer half-life than NOX-H94. We therefore believe that Noxxons results are not predictive for efficacy of PRS-080. Lilly has been developing a mAb against hepcidin in cancer as well as chronic kidney disease patients as well as a mAb against the ferroportin transporter. The latter has been suspended for unknown reasons and there has been no update on the anti-hepcidin mAb from Lilly since 2014. Ferrumax develops a soluble form of hemojuvelin, a protein that regulates hepcidin expression and iron metabolism that aims to suppress the production rate of hepcidin. 
 There are also a number of companies which are focused on treating anemia in CKD patients under alternative approaches. Fibrogen (in partnership with Astellas and AstraZeneca), Akebia Therapeutics (in partnership with Mitsubishi Tanabe and Otsuka), GSK, Bayer, Daiichi Sankyo, Zydus Cadila and Japan Tobacco have hypoxia-inducible-factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitors in clinical development that target stimulation of bone marrow activity. Fibrogen recently reported positive topline results from Phase III trials in China with its HIF-PH inhibitor Roxadustat (January 2017). Acceleron is targeting the sequestration of Activin A, a natural inhibitor of hematopoiesis, is in a Phase II clinical study. Auryxia by Keryx, which is an oral, absorbable, iron-based phosphate binder, completed a Phase III in non-dialysis dependent CKD 3-5 patients in 2016 and announced topline results showing that the study met the primary and all pre-specified secondary endpoints including change in Hb values. Keryx is planning to file a New Drug Application, or NDA for the CKD indication with the FDA in the near-term. There are also various companies conducting late-stage development of erythropoietin biosimilars. 
 PRS-060 
 Like PRS-060, new developments for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma patients mainly include drug candidates targeting the Th2 pathway by interfering with IL4/IL-13 or IL-5 actions. Such products 
 
26 
 
 include dupilumab (Sanofi/Regeneron, IL-4RA), tralokinumab (Astra Zeneca, IL-13), mepolizumab (Nucala) (GSK, IL-5), reslizumab (Teva, IL-5), and benralizumab (Astra Zeneca, IL-5R). These drugs are in later clinical development (Phase II and Phase III) than PRS-060, or have been approved (mepolizumab); however, in contrast to PRS-060, these mAbs are given to patients through injection and distribute systemically through the blood stream. There are a number of other companies presently marketing or developing other therapies for asthmatic patients. The mAb omalizumab, directed against IgE, is approved and marketed for the treatment of uncontrolled, moderate to severe asthma patients. 
 PRS-300 series 
 Other drug candidates which target checkpoint proteins include ipilimumab, which is specific for the checkpoint protein CTLA-4 and has been marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb for the treatment of melanoma patients since 2011. Additionally, preclinical and/or clinical testing currently focusing on additional checkpoint mechanisms and targets include PD-1 / PD-L1, LAG3, IDO, TIM3, Ox-40, CD-137, CD70, KIR and NKG2A. Bristol Myers Squibb and Roche are most active in this area, with multiple single agent or combination therapy trials ongoing. Merck and AstraZeneca also have active trials ongoing, while Novartis is placing more of an emphasis on adoptive T cell transfer technology in its developmental efforts. In September 2014, Merck received FDA approval for its anti- PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced or inoperable melanoma. 
 Under the 300-Series, we are also developing multispecific molecules to facilitate the more effective activation of the immune system, with a strategy of employing multispecific Anticalin protein-based molecules that may favorably bias an immune response to the tumor microenvironment. A number of other companies, such as Amgen, Affimed, Macrogenics, F-Star and Sutro, also pursue multispecific approaches in oncology, which therapies are in clinical or preclinical development. 
 PRS-343 
 PRS-343 is bispecific anticalin-antibody fusion protein targeting CD137 and HER2. Other drug candidates targeting the co-stimulatory receptor CD137 include urelumab, which is being developed by Bristol Myers Squibb, and PF-05082566, which is being developed by Pfizer, both of which are currently in clinical development (Biomedtracker, January 21, 2016). In the HER2-positive space, several companies are active with approved, clinical and preclinical drugs candidates. The most prominent company is Roche, having three approved drugs on the market through its subsidiary Genentech. The first drug from Roche targeting HER2 is Trastuzumab, which has been marketed for treatment of breast cancer patients since 1998 and for gastric cancer patients since 2010. The two other drugs are pertuzumab and Ado-trastuzumab Emtansine which both are marketed for breast cancer patients. 
 One company has publically disclosed a competitor program to PRS-343. Macrogenics presented preliminary data on a HER2 and CD137 (41BB) bispecific during their R&D day on December 13th, 2016. A number of companies such as Amgen, Affimed, F-Star, Sutro Biopharma and Immunocore are pursuing multispecific approaches in immuno-oncology, which therapies are either approved, in clinical development or preclinical development. 
 Additionally, other companies such as AstraZeneca, Novartis, Agenus, Five Prime Therapeutics, and Celldex have preclinical and clinical development programs focusing on other co-stimulatory targets which include OX40, CD40, GITR, and CD27. 
 PRS-332 
 PRS-332 is a bispecific anticalin-antibody fusion protein comprising an anti-PD-1 antibody genetically fused to an Anticalin targeting an undisclosed checkpoint target. Other drug candidates targeting the checkpoint molecule 
 
27 
 
 PD-1 include nivolumab, marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb (trade name Opdivo), and pembrolizumab, traded by Merck, (trade name Keytruda). Anti-PD-1 antibodies have demonstrated great clinical benefit in several cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, head and neck carcinomas. However, there are many patients who do not respond, relapse or acquire resistance to PD-1 treatment. In order to improve on existing PD-1 therapies, Pieris is developing PRS-332 with the intent to simultaneously block PD-1 and another immune checkpoint co-expressed on exhausted T cells. 
 Other companies such as BMS, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, and Hoffman La-Roche have clinical development programs focusing on the ligand PD-L1. 
 Additionally, other companies such as Merck, BMS, and Novartis have approved drugs or drugs in preclinical and clinical development focusing on other checkpoint targets which include CTLA-4, LAG-3 or TIM-3. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract manufacturers, or CMOs, for the manufacture of our drug candidates for larger scale preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial quantities of any drug candidates that are approved. 
 We currently rely on multiple CMOs for all of our clinical supplies, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), drug substances and finished drug products, and label & packaging for our preclinical research and clinical trials, including the Phase Ia trial for PRS-080. 
 We believe that we will be able to contract with other CMOs to obtain APIs if our existing sources of APIs were no longer available or sufficient, but there is no assurance that APIs would be available from other third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, on the timeframe that our business would require, or at all. We do not have long-term supply commitments or other arrangements in place with our existing CMOs. We also do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of bulk drug substance. 
 We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of any of our drug candidates if they are approved, and we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more back-up manufacturers for the commercial production of our product candidates as they near potential approval. 
 Any drug products to be used in clinical trials and any approved product that we may commercialize will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the FDAs current good manufacturing practice requirements and comparable requirements of the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing contractors. 
 We believe that PRS-080, PRS-060, and PRS 343 and our other Anticalin®-branded drug candidates can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible biologic processes from readily available starting materials. PRS-080 and PRS-060 are produced using bacterial expression systems similar to those that have been used in the past for the production of other proteins and which systems are widely used in the industry. PRS-343 is produced using a mammalian expression system similar to those systems which are widely used in the industry for the production of antibodies. We believe that the manufacturing process is amenable to scale-up and will not require unusual or expensive equipment. We expect to continue to develop, on our own or with our collaborators, drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities. 
 Intellectual Property and Exclusivity 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain exclusivity of our proprietary Anticalin®-brand technologies through intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, libraries of 
 
28 
 
 different protein scaffolds and consensus sequences and the fundamental Anticalin platform technology, including novel therapeutic and diagnostic discoveries, as well as other proprietary know-how, and to operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. 
 We seek to protect our exclusive position of Anticalin technologies by, among other means, prosecuting our own international, U.S., and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We established intellectual property protection in relation to our Anticalin technologies in key global markets, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, and the United States. We believe we have patent exclusivity relating to drug candidates derived from lipocalin proteins that runs until at least 2018 in the United States. We also rely on trade secrets for confidential know-how, which we generally seek to protect through contractual (e.g. confidentiality) agreements with employees and third parties. 
 We have protected the goodwill of our Company and our drug candidates, created through innovation and development, by putting in place trademark registrations of Pieris and Anticalin as well as several defensive registrations. 
 We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file patent applications and maintain granted patents directed to our key drug candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions relating to new compositions of matter for these drug candidates, as well as novel medical applications of these compounds in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of various indications. We also intend to seek patent protection, if available, with respect to biomarkers that may contribute to selecting the right patient population for use of any of our drug candidates, or with respect to pharmaceutical formulations that may be useful to produce final medicinal products. 
 Following the effective date of our Research and Licensing Agreement with Technische Universität München, or TUM (See TUM License Agreement), and as of March 23, 2017, we owned or were the exclusive licensee of a patent portfolio consisting of several issued U.S. patents, and their respective counterparts in a number of foreign jurisdictions, several pending applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, multiple pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding pending patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions as well as three pending provisional patent applications, as described in further detail below. 
 In applicable jurisdictions, we will seek patent term extensions for certain patents of ours, including the patent term adjustment period in the United States. If we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in the United States or in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, we may be eligible for regulatory protection, such as twelve years of data exclusivity for new biological entities in the United States and as mentioned below, up to five years of patent term extension potentially available in the United States under the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, eight to eleven years of data and marketing exclusivity potentially available for new drugs in the European Union, up to five years of patent extension in Europe (supplemental protection certificate), and eight years of data exclusivity potentially available in Japan. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for any such regulatory exclusivity, or that any such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies. See Government Regulation. 
 Among the issued patents we own are U.S. Patent No. 7,250,297; U.S. Patent No. 7,723,476; U.S. patent No. 8,158,753; U.S. patent No. 8,536,307; and their respective counterparts in the European Union, which patents are directed to the basic Anticalin protein concept and platform technology (i.e. antagonist or agonist compounds derived from a natural lipocalin protein) and are expected to expire in 2018, subject to any patent term adjustments and terminal disclaimers in the United States. In addition, we hold issued U.S. Patents Nos.: 7,001,882; 7,118,915; 7,691,970; 7,585,940; 7,893,208; 8,313,924; and 9,549,968 and their respective counterparts in a number of foreign jurisdictions, which patents are related to libraries of different scaffolds and consensus sequences such as human apolipoprotein D, human neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, or hNGAL, and human tear lipocalin, and are expected to expire between 2020 and 2030, subject to any patent term adjustments and terminal disclaimers in the United States. We also own U.S. Patent No. 7,892,827, which is 
 
29 
 
 directed to muteins derived from hNGAL having binding specificity for the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen, or CTLA-4, and is expected to expire in 2025, subject to any term adjustments and terminal disclaimers in the United States, and U.S. Patent No. 8,313,924, which is directed to muteins of human tear lipocalin having detectable binding affinity to interleukin 4 receptor alpha chain, or IL-4 receptor alpha, and is expected to expire in 2027, subject to any patent term adjustments and terminal disclaimers in the United States, as well as their counterparts in the European Union and in a number of foreign jurisdictions. 
 As a result of research efforts to date under the Research and License Agreement with TUM, we hold a worldwide exclusive license to multiple patents and patent applications. In the United States, we hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. Patent No. 8,598,317 for the composition of matter of mutein of human tear lipocalin binding to the extracellular region of the T-cell co-receptor CD4 with detectable affinity, which patent will expire in 2027 subject to any patent term adjustments and terminal disclaimers in the United States, as well as to its counterpart in the European Union. We also hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. Patent No. 8,420,051 directed to library of hNGAL scaffold of certain consensus sequence, which patent is expected to expire in 2029, subject to any patent term adjustments or terminal disclaimers in the United States, as well as to its counterparts in the European Union and in a number of foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, we hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. Patent No. 8,987,415 claiming isolated crystalline form of monomeric bacterial lipocalin. 
 As of January 26, 2017, a significant portion of our pending U.S. patent applications and pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions was directed to newly-discovered or improved scaffold libraries of lipocalin muteins, compounds derived therefrom, or the uses of such compounds to treat, prevent and mitigate certain diseases and conditions whose pathological development involve the targets of interest as well as to diagnose, prognose and select treatments for the diseases and conditions. We would expect that any patents that may issue from the pending U.S. patent applications would likely expire between 2029 and 2038 without taking into account possible patent term adjustments or other extensions, however, any and all of these patent applications may not result in issued patents, and not all issued patents may be maintained in force for their entire term. Specifically, granted patents and pending patent applications directed to Anticalin proteins for the cMet target currently have terms which could expire as late as 2029, and granted patents and pending patent applications directed to Anticalin proteins for each of hepcidin and IL-4RA currently have terms, which could expire as late as 2031. We are actively pursuing intellectual property protection for our 300-Series in key global markets that, if granted, could expire as late as 2038. 
 In addition to patents, we hold trademarks in the United States, for Anticalin, Pieris, and Pocket Binding. Similarly, we hold their respective counterparts, either as registered trademarks or as pending applications, in a number of foreign jurisdictions. We expect that we will continue to look for trademark protection for the goodwill associated with our Company and our drug candidates in the countries or regions where we will have investment, research and development, sales or other activities. 
 We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive advantage. We strive to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements and/or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also actively manage our publication and patent applications in that we only disclose information necessary to stir scientific interest or demonstrate patentability without materially compromising the secrecy of our valuable trade secrets and know-how. While we consider trade secrets and know-how to be a critical component of our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, with respect to our technology platform, we anticipate that these trade secrets and know-how will, over the course of time, be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology and the movement of personnel skilled in the technology from academic to industry positions and vice versa. As a result, those proprietary trade 
 
30 
 
 secrets and know-how may lose their value to us over a period of time, and we may lose any competitive advantage afforded by them, as they become public knowledge. 
 Strategic Partnerships 
 Since 2007, we have entered into several licensing, research and development collaborations to complement our drug discovery and early stage development capabilities. Specifically, we have entered into licensing, research and development agreements, which are still active as of the date hereof with Allergan, Inc., or Allergan, Sanofi Group (formerly Sanofi-Aventis and Sanofi-Pasteur SA) and collectively, Sanofi, Daiichi Sankyo, Roche, Servier and Aska. Under these licensing and research and development arrangements, we have developed and conducted or will develop and conduct selection and screening of drug candidates, as well as in vitro potency and efficacy testing, using our Anticalin®-brand drug discovery platform, our Anticalin-brand libraries, and other proprietary methods to generate, identify, and characterize drug candidates against certain biological targets associated with several diseases. These agreements have provided us with approximately 38.6 million ($42.1 million) in revenue to date, excluding grant revenues. With respect to discontinued collaborations, we have no ongoing performance obligations, and do not expect to receive any significant additional consideration pursuant to those agreements. 
 Pieriss agreements with Allergan, Sanofi, Daiichi Sankyo, Roche, Servier and Aska are ongoing and, under which, our partners are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize drug candidates identified in the course of the collaboration. We are entitled to receive from our partners research, development and regulatory milestone payments and, in the case of the Sanofi, Daiichi Sankyo, Roche, Servier and Aska collaborations, royalties on net sales for products developed and commercialized under these collaborations. We plan to continue to actively seek out additional collaboration partners. 
 In addition to Pieriss agreements with Allergan, Sanofi, Daiichi Sankyo Roche, Servier, and Aska, we are partnering with companies with expertise in clinical development, regulatory affairs and biologics manufacturing to advance our pipeline products through clinical trials and to market those products. In 2013, Pieris entered into a co-development alliance with Cadila Healthcare Limited, or Zydus, with respect to the development and sale of certain proprietary products, under which Zydus will focus on developing markets and we will focus on developed markets. Certain terms and conditions of our active agreements with Allergan, Sanofi, Daiichi Sankyo, Roche, Servier, and Aska are summarized below as well as certain terms and conditions of our co-development agreements with Zydus and Stelis. 
 Our agreement with Allergan 
 In August 2009, we entered into an agreement with Allergan, Inc. (NYSE: AGN) for the use of our proprietary Anticalin technologies in the discovery and development of drug candidates which inhibit a selected target. Under the terms of the agreement, we provided drug candidates for the treatment of ocular diseases, and Allergan is responsible for the further development and commercialization of products based on those candidates and bearing related costs. We have granted Allergan a worldwide and exclusive license under our patent portfolio for the use of certain drug candidates for the treatment and prevention of ocular diseases. 
 Upon entering into the agreement, we received a payment of $10 million. We are entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $13 million in additional payments on achieving various milestones. We are not entitled to any royalties from sales of products commercialized under our agreement with Allergan. During the term of the agreement and as long as Allergan commercializes the drug candidates designated under the agreement, we may not grant rights to any third party with respect to any drug candidates that inhibit the same target within the field licensed to Allergan. 
 The agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the payment obligations of Allergan to us thereunder. Either we or Allergan may terminate the agreement in the event of the other partys material breach of the 
 
31 
 
 agreement remains uncured for a specified period or in the event the bankruptcy of the other party. Allergan has the unilateral right to terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice to us. On termination, all rights granted to Allergan in our Anticalin technologies would end. 
 Our collaboration with Sanofi 
 In September 2010, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi, which was subsequently amended in February 2013. Under the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to use our proprietary Anticalin technologies to identify drug candidates against certain targets, with further development and commercialization activities conducted by Sanofi. The collaboration started with two targets under two separate collaboration projects and was extended by an additional multispecific Anticalin program in 2013. When we entered the collaboration, we granted Sanofi an exclusive worldwide license to develop drug candidates identified in the course of the collaboration and market products based on those drug candidates under the collaboration. 
 In consideration of our obligations, as a part of the collaboration we received a 3.5 million ($3.8 million) upfront payment and specified research funding. We also are entitled to receive payments on the achievement of research, development and commercial milestones for each product, with up to 26.5 million ($27.9 million) in development milestones and up to 18 million ($18.9 million) in commercial milestones for the first therapeutic application and lesser amounts on subsequent therapeutic applications. We have the ability to receive over 50 million ($52.6 million) potential milestone payments from the active collaboration project, including estimated milestone payments in connection with one or more subsequent applications. Payments due to us also include tiered mid-to mid-high single digit royalties on sales of products. We have agreed that we will not use our Anticalin technologies to perform, on our own behalf or for third parties, any research or development activities on the same target to which any active program relates. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of all payment and related obligations of Sanofi thereunder. 
 During the term of the agreement, Sanofi may terminate any or all programs thereunder for convenience by giving specified prior written notice to us. Either party may also terminate the agreement for a material breach by the other party which remains uncured after specified advance notice of such breach or for the other partys insolvency. If a program or the agreement is terminated by Sanofi, rights in products and developed technology resulting from the terminated program (including the right to grant sublicenses) revert or are transferred to us. If a program is terminated prior to the development of the product by Sanofi, our right to commercialize that product is royalty-free. Otherwise, we would owe to Sanofi royalties in the single digits as a percentage of net sales on such product sold by us or our licensee, with total royalty payments capped at a certain amount, and with the royalty rate dependent on the maturity of the program at the time of termination. Sanofi has terminated two of the three programs (one program was terminated for internal strategic reasons and the other program was terminated following in vivo studies, as in vitro functionality did not fully translate into in vivo functionality for this first in class program), and we have the right to develop and commercialize drug candidates of the terminated programs on a royalty-free basis. The remaining active collaboration project was handed over to Sanofi for further development in the fourth quarter of 2014. Additionally, in January 2015, we transferred ownership of the intellectual property of the remaining active collaboration project to Sanofi, including the obligation for payment of expenses of obtaining patents or other registrations of such intellectual property. All other rights and obligations of the parties under the Sanofi collaboration remain unchanged. 
 Our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo 
 In May 2011, we entered into a definitive collaboration research and technology licensing agreement with Daiichi Sankyo, under which we agreed to use our proprietary Anticalin® scaffold technologies to discover novel drug candidates against two targets chosen by Daiichi Sankyo under two separate collaboration projects. Upon achievement of preclinical development milestones for lead drug candidates, Daiichi Sankyo assumes responsibility for, and to use commercially reasonable efforts in, the further development and marketing of products based on those candidates. We handed over further development responsibility for the two collaboration projects to Daiichi Sankyo in March 2013 and June 2014, respectively. 
 
32 
 
We received 7.2 million ($7.9 million) upon signing of the collaboration agreement and received research funding. We are entitled to payment on the achievement of research and development milestones of up to 35.9 million ($37.7 million) for the first prophylactic or therapeutic product, with reduced amounts for achievement of those milestones in additional indications. We are also entitled to payment of commercialization milestones of up to 45 million ($47.3 million) for a prophylactic or therapeutic product. On development and commercialization of a diagnostic product, we are entitled to development and commercialization milestones of up to approximately 0.7 million ($0.7 million). We have the ability to receive up to approximately 200 million ($210 million) in potential milestone payments from the two collaboration projects, including estimated milestone payments in connection with one or more additional indications. Daiichi Sankyo is further obliged to pay to us tiered, mid- to mid-high single digit royalties on sales of products for prophylactic and therapeutic uses and low single digits on sales of products for diagnostic uses. We granted Daiichi Sankyo exclusive license rights worldwide for prophylactic and therapeutic products, and nonexclusive rights for diagnostic uses. During the collaboration, we may not use our Anticalin® technologies in research or commercial activities on the designated targets for our own account or with third parties. 
 Daiichi Sankyo may terminate any program under the collaboration after a certain research stage for convenience by giving specified prior written notice to us. Either party may also terminate the agreement for a material breach by the other party which remains uncured after specified advance notice of such breach or for the other partys insolvency. If a program is terminated, rights in products and developed technology resulting from the terminated program (including the right to grant sublicenses) revert or are transferred to us. If we terminate a program because of a material breach by Daiichi Sankyo, our sale of products resulting from the program is royalty-free. If a program is terminated by us because of Daiichi Sankyos failure to meet diligence obligations or by Daiichi Sankyo for convenience, we will be required to pay to Daiichi Sankyo royalties on sale of products resulting from the program in the low single digits as a percentage of net sales up to a specified aggregate royalty amount. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will remain in effect until (i) the expiration of all payment and related obligations of Daiichi Sankyo thereunder or (ii) upon the decision of Daiichi Sankyo not to develop any drug candidate under the collaboration agreement. 
 Our collaboration with Roche 
 On December 8, 2015, Pieris entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement with F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann- La Roche Inc., collectively Roche, in cancer immune therapy for the research, development and commercialization of Anticalin-based drug candidates against a predefined, undisclosed target. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of CHF 6.5 million ($6.5 million) in January 2016 and Roche committed to provide research funding, and we may receive development and regulatory-based milestone payments, sales-based milestone payments as well as mid-single-digit to low double-digit royalties on any future product sales. If all milestones and other conditions are met, the total payments to us could surpass CHF 415 million ($415.7 million), excluding royalties. 
 The parties will jointly pursue a preclinical research program with respect to the identification and generation of Anticalins that bind to a specific target for an expected period of 20 months, which may be extended under certain circumstances. During the research term of the agreement, Roche will fund the work to be performed by us pursuant to the research plan. Following the research program, Roche will be responsible for subsequent pre-clinical and clinical development of any product and will have worldwide commercialization rights. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the term of the agreement continues until no royalty or other payment obligations are or will become due under the agreement. The agreement may be terminated (i) by either party based on insolvency or breach by the other party and such insolvency proceeding is not dismissed or such breach is not cured within 90 days; or (ii) after 15 months from the effective date of the agreement, by Roche as a whole or on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis upon 90 days prior written notice before the first commercial sale of a product or upon 180 days prior written notice after the first commercial sale of a product.

 Roche may also, in its sole discretion, terminate the agreement upon a change of control of Pieris involving a company that develops or commercializes biopharmaceutical products. 
 Our collaboration with Servier 
 On January 4, 2017, we, along with Pieris GmbH, entered into a license and collaboration agreement and a non-exclusive license agreement with Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier, collectively Servier. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, we, along with Servier, will initially pursue five bispecific therapeutic programs, led by our PRS-332 program. We will jointly develop PRS-332 and split commercial rights geographically, with Pieris retaining all commercial rights in the U.S. and Servier having commercial rights in the rest of the world. The four additional committed programs, which have been defined, may combine antibodies from the Servier portfolio with one or more Anticalin proteins based on our proprietary platform to generate innovative immuno-oncology bispecific drug candidates. The collaboration may be expanded by up to three additional therapeutic programs. We also have the option to co-develop and retain commercial rights in the U.S. for up to three programs beyond PRS-332, while Servier will be responsible for development and commercialization of the other programs worldwide. 
 Under the agreements, we received an upfront payment of EUR30 million (approximately 31.3 million USD). We may also receive funding for full time staff for specific projects, as well as development-dependent and commercial milestone payments for PRS-332 and each additional program. The total development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments to us could exceed EUR1.7 billion (approximately 1.8 billion USD) over the life of the collaboration and are dependent on the final number of projects pursued and the number of co-development options exercised by us. We will share preclinical and clinical development costs for each co-developed program with Servier. In addition, we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties up to low double digits on the sales of commercialized products in the Servier territories. 
 The term of each agreement ends upon the expiration of all of Serviers payment obligations under such agreement. The agreements may be terminated by Servier for convenience beginning 12 months after their effective date upon 180 days notice. The agreements may also be terminated by either of us for material breach upon 90 days or 120 days notice of a material breach, with respect to the collaboration agreement and license agreement, respectively, provided that the applicable party has not cured such breach by the applicable 90-day or 120-day permitted cure period, and dispute resolution procedures specified in the applicable Agreement have been followed. The agreements may also be terminated due to the other partys insolvency or for a safety issue and may in certain instances be terminated on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis. The license agreement will terminate upon termination of the collaboration agreement, on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis. 
 Collaboration with Aska 
 On February 27, 2017, we entered into an Exclusive Option Agreement with ASKA Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Aska, granting Aska an exclusive option to license development and commercial rights to Pieris anemia drug, PRS-080, in Japan and certain other Asian markets following completion of a multi-dose Phase 2a study to be conducted by Pieris in dialysis-dependent anemia patients. 
 Under the terms of the option agreement, we received an option payment of $2.75 million from ASKA. Following an analysis period after the completion of the planned Phase 2a study conducted by Pieris, ASKA may exercise its option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize PRS-080 in Japan, South Korea and certain other Asian markets (excluding China). Should ASKA exercise the option, we would be eligible for more than $80 million in combined option exercise fee and milestones associated with development and commercialization of PRS-080 in the first indication in Japan. We may receive further development milestones in additional indications, as well as in other countries within the ASKA territory. We may also receive double-digit royalties on net sales of PRS-080 up to the mid- to high-teens. 
 
34 
 
The term of the Exclusive Option Agreement, including the option rights granted therein, ends on the earlier of (i) ASKAs written notice to us of ASKAs decision not to exercise the option rights granted under the Exclusive Option Agreement, (ii) ASKAs failure to exercise its option rights within sixty (60) days after the final results of the Phase 2a study are made available to ASKA, (iii) three (3) months from date on which we deliver to ASKA the final results of the Phase 2a study in the European Union, or (iv) our and ASKAs execution of the definitive agreements granting ASKA licenses to develop and commercialize PRS-080 in the Japan, South Korea and certain other Asian countries as contemplated under the Exclusive Option Agreement. 
 TUM License Agreement 
 On July 4, 2003, we entered into a Research and Licensing agreement with TUM, which was subsequently renewed and amended, on July 26, 2007. The agreement established a joint research effort led by Prof. Arne Skerra, Chair of Biological Chemistry of TUM, to optimize Anticalin technologies for use in therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic applications and as research reagents, and to gain fundamental insights in lipocalin scaffolds. We provided certain funding for TUM research efforts performed under the agreement. The research phase of this collaboration ended on February 28, 2013. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, TUM assigned to us certain materials and records resulting from the research. We retained rights to inventions made by our employees, and TUM assigned to us all inventions made under the agreement jointly by our employees and TUM personnel, provided that our employees made certain inventive contributions. With respect to all other inventions made in the course of the research, TUM granted to us worldwide exclusive license rights under patents and patent applications claiming such inventions. TUM retained rights to practice these inventions for research and teaching purposes. 
 As a result of research efforts to date under the agreement, we hold a worldwide exclusive license under our license agreement with TUM to multiple patents and patent applications. In the United States, we hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent No. 8,598,317 for the composition of matter of mutein of human tear lipocalin binding to the extracellular region of the T-cell co-receptor CD4 with detectable affinity, which patent will expire in 2027 (subject to a patent term adjustment period which is expected to be at least 742 days), as well as to its counterpart in the European Union. We also hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent No. 8,420,051 directed to library of hNGAL scaffold of certain consensus sequence, which patent is expected to expire in 2029 (subject to a patent term adjustment period of 109 days), as well as to its counterparts in the European Union and in a number of foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, we hold an exclusive license to an issued U.S. patent No. 8,987,415 claiming isolated crystalline form of monomeric bacterial lipocalin. We bear the costs of filing, prosecution and maintenance of patents assigned or licensed to us under the agreement. 
 As consideration for the assignments and licenses, we are obliged to pay to TUM milestone payments on development of our proprietary products claimed by patents assigned or licensed to us by TUM. For each of such proprietary products developed by us, we could be required to pay up to an aggregate of approximately 0.2 million ($0.2 million) in milestone payments to TUM under the agreement. 
 We also are obliged to pay low single digit royalties, including annual minimum royalties, on sales of such products. Should we grant licenses or sublicenses to those patents to third parties, we are obliged to share a percentage of resulting revenue with TUM, which percentage of resulting revenue is creditable against our annual license payments to TUM. Our payment obligations are reduced by our proportionate contribution to a joint invention. Payment obligations terminate on expiration or annulment of the last patent covered by the agreement. 
 We can terminate the licenses to any or all licensed patents upon specified advance notice to TUM. TUM may terminate the license provisions of the agreement only for cause. Termination of the agreement does not terminate our rights in patents assigned to us. 
 
35 
 
Enumeral License Agreement 
 On April 18, 2016, we entered into a License Agreement with Enumeral Biomedical Holdings, Inc., or Enumeral, pursuant to which we acquired a non-exclusive (except in the exclusive field described below) worldwide license to use specified patent rights and know-how owned by Enumeral to research, develop and market fusion proteins consisting of PD-1 antibodies linked to one or more Anticalin proteins for use in the oncology area. Enumeral also agreed not to practice or assist third parties in practicing in the exclusive field, consisting of licensed antibodies fused to Anticalin proteins in the oncology area. 
 On June 6, 2016, we entered into a Definitive License Agreement to fully set forth the terms of Enumerals license of PD-1 antibodies and grant of options to license additional antibodies to us. Under the Definitive License and Transfer Agreement, we in-licensed intellectual property related to an Enumeral-generated antibody against PD-1 and an option to in-license up to two additional antibodies against undisclosed targets. Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired a non-exclusive worldwide license under the applicable Enumeral patents and know-how to research, develop and commercialize fusion proteins incorporating Enumerals PD-1 antibody and one or more Anticalin proteins, or the Subsequent Options, which was an expansion of the scope of the original License Agreement. 
 The Subsequent Options expire on May 31, 2017. If we license an additional antibody pursuant to a Subsequent Option, Pieris must pay to Enumeral an additional option exercise payment, and any resulting fusion protein products will be subject to royalties and development and sales milestones in the same amounts applicable to the fusion proteins consisting of an Enumerals PD-1 antibody linked to one or more Anticalin® proteins. We are also obliged to pay to Enumeral development and sales milestones on development of products incorporating the Enumeral antibody, as well as low to lower-middle single-digit royalties as a percentage of net sales depending on the amount of net sales in the applicable years. In the event that we are required to pay a license fee or royalty to any third party related to the licensed products, our royalty payment obligations to Enumeral are reduced by the amount of such third party fees or payments, up to 50% of the royalty payment for each calendar year due to Enumeral. Payment obligations terminate on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the later of ten years from the first commercial sale of a product incorporating the Enumeral antibody or the last to expire, lapse or be abandoned of a claim from the licensed Enumeral patents filed as of the effective date of the agreement that cover the manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or import of a product incorporating the Enumeral antibody. 
 The term of the Definitive License Agreement ends upon the expiration of the last to expire patent covered under the license. The Agreement may be terminated by us on 30 days notice and by Enumeral upon 60 days notice of a material breach by us (or 30 days with respect to a breach of payment obligations by us), provided that we have not cured such breach and dispute resolution procedures specified in the Definitive License Agreement have been followed. 
 Government Regulation 
 United States  FDA Process 
 The research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, among other things, of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. 
U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, or their issuance of warning 
 
36 
 
 letters, or the imposition of fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an New Drug Application, NDA or Biologic License Application , or BLA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. 
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects for any clinical trial before it commences at that center, and the IRB must monitor the study until it is completed. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. There are also requirements governing the reporting of on-going clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase I: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase II: This phase involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase III: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
37 
 
The FDA or an IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. Including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the End of Phase II meeting to discuss their Phase II clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA, or an approved letter following satisfactory completion of all aspects of the review process. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the products identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the products continued safety, purity and potency. 
 NDAs or BLAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. Priority review for an NDA for a new molecular entity and original BLAs will be six months from the date that the NDA or BLA is filed. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical 
 
38 
 
 endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drugs safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, made permanent the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, which requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most drugs and biologicals, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension. These patent term extensions permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for any patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of fourteen years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the U.S. The FDASIA made permanent the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, which provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA, or a Written Request. If a Written Request does not include studies in neonates, the FDA is required to include its rationale for not requesting those studies. The FDA may request studies on approved or unapproved indications in separate Written Requests. The issuance of a Written Request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies. 
 Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 
 In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted in the U.S. and included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, to create an abbreviated approval pathway for two types of generic biologicsbiosimilars and interchangeable biologic products, and provides for a twelve-year exclusivity period for the first approved biological product, or reference product, against which a biosimilar or interchangeable application is evaluated; however if pediatric studies are performed and accepted by the FDA, the twelve-year exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. 
 
39 
 
The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical studies to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency. 
 An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first approved. The first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed, but the exclusivity period may be shortened under certain circumstances. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitors product for the same indication or disease. 
 The FDA also administers a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may compete for funding to conduct clinical trials to support the approval of drugs, biologics, medical devices, and medical foods for rare diseases and conditions. A product does not have to be designated as an orphan drug to be eligible for the grant program. An application for an orphan grant should propose one discrete clinical study to facilitate FDA approval of the product for a rare disease or condition. The study may address an unapproved new product or an unapproved new use for a product already on the market. 
 Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request. 
 Under the fast track program and the FDAs accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 
40 
 
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post- approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drugs BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws and regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. 
 Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. 
 From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the 28-member European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 
41 
 
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. 
 When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the EU Clinical Trials Directive and the laws and regulations of the EU Member States implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the submission and approval of a clinical trial authorization application be obtained in each Member State be obtained before commencing a clinical trial in that Member State. 
 As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitors generic product. As in the United States, a sponsor may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. 
 Reimbursement 
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to by significantly lower. 
 Description of the Acquisition 
 On December 17, 2014, Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pieris Pharmaceuticals GmbH (Pieris GmbH) and the former stockholders of Pieris GmbH entered into an Acquisition Agreement, or the Acquisition Agreement.

 becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Pieris, which we refer to as the Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, as defined below, Pieris pursued a business of an errand concierge service online marketplace. 
 Prior to the closing of the Acquisition, on December 5, 2014, Pieris completed a 2.272727-for-1 forward split of its common stock in the form of a share dividend, with the result that 6,100,000 shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the stock split became 13,863,647 shares of common stock outstanding immediately thereafter. On December 16, 2014, Pieris amended and restated its Articles of Incorporation to, among other things, change its name from Marika Inc. to Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and increase its authorized capital stock from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. 
 On December 17, 2014, Pieris, Pieris GmbH and the former stockholders of Pieris GmbH entered into an Acquisition Agreement, or the Acquisition Agreement. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the stockholders of Pieris GmbH contributed all of their equity interests in Pieris GmbH to Pieris in exchange for shares of Pieris common stock, which resulted in Pieris GmbH becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Pieris, which we refer to as the Acquisition. The Acquisition closed on December 17, 2014. 
 In connection with the Acquisition and pursuant to a Split-Off Agreement, dated December 17, 2014 among Pieris, Marika Enterprises Inc. and Aleksandrs Sviks, or the Split-Off Agreement, and a general release agreement, Pieris transferred its pre-Acquisition assets and liabilities to its former majority stockholder, Aleksandrs Sviks, in exchange for the surrender by him and cancellation of 11,363,635 shares of Pieris common stock, or the Split-Off. Upon the closing of the Acquisition and the Split-Off, Pieris discontinued its pre-Acquisition business plans and is now pursuing only the business of Pieris GmbH. 
 Upon the closing of the Acquisition, Pieris ceased to be a shell company under applicable rules of the SEC. On December 17, 2014, in connection with the Acquisition, our Board of Directors changed our fiscal year from a fiscal year ending on June 30 to one ending on December 31 of each year, which was the fiscal year of Pieris GmbH. 
 Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, establishes a class of company called an emerging growth company, which generally is a company whose initial public offering was completed after December 8, 2011 and had total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. Additionally, Section 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, establishes a class of company called a smaller reporting company, which generally is a company with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, if such public float is $0, had annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available. We currently qualify as both an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company. 
 As an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, we are eligible to take advantage of certain extended accounting standards and exemptions from various reporting requirements that are not available to public reporting companies that do not qualify for those classifications, including without limitation the following: 
 

 | An emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will not be required to adopt new or revised accounting standards on the dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public reporting companies.

 | An emerging growth company is exempt from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and financial statements, commonly known as an auditor discussion and analysis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | An emerging growth company is not required to hold nonbinding advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation or any golden parachute payments not previously approved by stockholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Neither an emerging growth company nor a smaller reporting company is required to comply with the requirement of auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting, which is required for other public reporting companies by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A company that is either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company is eligible for reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic and annual reports, including without limitation exemption from the requirement to provide a compensation discussion and analysis describing compensation practices and procedures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A company that is either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company is eligible for reduced financial statement disclosure in its registration statements, which must include two years of audited financial statements rather than the three years of audited financial statements that are required for other public reporting companies. Smaller reporting companies are also eligible to provide such reduced financial statement disclosure in annual reports on Form 10-K.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company and/or a smaller reporting company, we expect that we will take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations available to us as a result of those respective classifications. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2019, the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under applicable SEC rules. We expect that we will remain an emerging growth company for the foreseeable future, but cannot retain our emerging growth company status indefinitely and will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company on or before December 31, 2019. We will remain a smaller reporting company until we have a public float of $75 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we could retain our smaller reporting company status indefinitely depending on the size of our public float. 
 Employees 
 As of March 23, 2017, we had 49 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. In order to successfully develop our drug candidates, we must be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We anticipate hiring additional employees for research and development, clinical and regulatory affairs and general and administrative activities over the next few years. We also utilize the services of consultants, clinical research organizations, and other third parties on a regular basis.
