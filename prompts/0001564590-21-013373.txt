Company Overview
 Select Interior Concepts, Inc. (collectively with all of its subsidiaries, “SIC,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) is an installer and nationwide distributor of interior building products with market positions in residential interior design services. 
 Through our Residential Design Services (which we refer to as “RDS”) operating segment, we serve national and regional homebuilders by providing an integrated, outsourced solution for the design, consultation, sourcing, distribution and installation needs of their homebuyer customers. Through our 17 design centers, our designers work closely with homebuyers in the selection of a broad array of interior products and finishes, including flooring, cabinets, countertops, wall tile, and related interior items, primarily for newly constructed homes. We then coordinate the ordering, fulfillment and installation of many of these interior products to provide a streamlined experience for the homebuyer. With our design centers and our product sourcing and installation capabilities, we enable our homebuilder customers to outsource critical aspects of their business to us, thereby increasing their sales, profitability, and return on capital.  
 We also have leading market positions in the selection and importation of natural and engineered stone slabs for kitchen and bathroom countertops and specialty tiles through our Architectural Surfaces Group (which we refer to as “ASG”) operating segment. ASG sources natural and engineered stone from a global supply base, and markets these materials through a national network of distribution centers and showrooms at 21 different locations. In addition to serving the new residential and commercial construction markets with these materials, we also distribute them to the repair and remodel (which we refer to as “R&R”) market.
 Our History
 The SIC platform originated in September 2014, when affiliates of Trive Capital Management LLC (which we refer to as “Trive Capital”) acquired RDS, which in turn acquired the assets of PT Tile Holdings, LP (which we refer to as “Pinnacle”) in February 2015, and 100% of the equity interests in Greencraft Holdings, LLC (which we refer to as “Greencraft”) in December 2017. RDS then acquired the assets of Summit Stoneworks, LLC (which we refer to as “Summit”) in August 2018, 100% of the equity interests in T.A.C. Ceramic Tile Co. (which we refer to as “TAC”) in December 2018, and acquired the assets of Intown Design, Inc., Intown Granite of Charlotte, Inc., and Granitec, LLC, (collectively, “Intown”) in March 2019.
 Affiliates of Trive Capital also formed a consolidation platform in the stone countertop market by acquiring 100% of the equity interests in Architectural Granite & Marble, LLC in June 2015, which in turn acquired the assets of Bermuda Import-Export, Inc. (which we refer to as “Modul”) in July 2016, 100% of the equity interests in Pental Granite and Marble, LLC (which we refer to as “Pental”) in February 2017, and the assets of Cosmic Stone & Tile Distributors, Inc. (which we refer to as “Cosmic”) in October 2017, and these acquired businesses were combined to form ASG. ASG then acquired the assets of Elegant Home Design, LLC (which we refer to as “Bedrock”) in January 2018, the assets of NSI, LLC (which we refer to as “NSI”) in March 2018, and the assets of The Tuscany Collection, LLC (which we refer to as “Tuscany”) in August 2018.  
 November 2017 Restructuring Transactions
 In November 2017, Select Interior Concepts, Inc. and the former equity holders of RDS and ASG completed a series of restructuring transactions (collectively, the “November 2017 restructuring transactions”) pursuant to which Select Interior Concepts, Inc. acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in each of RDS and ASG, including all of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries.  Following the November 2017 restructuring transactions, Select Interior Concepts, Inc. became a holding company that wholly owns RDS and ASG.

Residential Design Services
 RDS enters into exclusive service agreements with homebuilders at the beginning of certain new community development projects to provide them with a single-source solution for the design center operations, consultation, sourcing, fulfillment, and installation phases of the homebuilding process. At our design centers, our design staff work directly with homebuyers to help them achieve their design, styling, and product needs, leveraging our web-based preference analysis and proprietary software system to enable real-time pricing of interior options.  
 During the initial design phase of a new residential development, RDS often assists builders with upfront planning of design elements and interior options. These alternatives then become the standard packages and design options which are the basis from which the new homebuyer makes upgrade selections. During the initial construction phase, RDS offers a full suite of interior customization options to homebuyers in its design centers, providing the opportunity to upgrade to higher priced options that are not part of the homebuilder’s standard package. These upgrades result in higher revenue and profitability for both RDS and the homebuilder, who shares in the incremental revenue from any upgrades. RDS also provides installation services, ensuring that the finished product meets the homebuyer’s specifications.
 RDS’ collection of design options enables homebuyers to customize their homes with high quality interior finishes and provides homebuilders with a single partner to handle the majority of the interior design elements in a new home. RDS offers numerous interior surface categories which includes flooring, cabinets, countertops and wall tile.
 Architectural Surfaces Group
 Our ASG segment imports and distributes natural and engineered stone slabs, as well as tile, through 21 strategically positioned showrooms and warehouse locations across the United States. Our stone slabs include marble, granite, porcelain and quartz, for use as kitchen and bathroom countertops, and our tiles consist of ceramic and porcelain for flooring, backsplash, and wall tile applications. We provide our services throughout markets in the Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Midwest, Mountain West, and West Coast regions of the United States and offer a targeted merchandising strategy, including displaying our products in customer-oriented showrooms that cater to professional interior designers and architects as well as homeowners. Our product lines are tailored to the specific geographic regions that we serve.
 We have relationships with a wide array of stone slab quarries, manufacturers and distributors around the world and offer our customers a broad and consistent selection of high-quality stone slabs from a global supply chain.
 Competition
 Our markets are highly fragmented and competitive. We face competition from large home improvement stores, national and regional interior surface retailers and distributors, and independent design centers. Some of our competitors are organizations that are larger, are better capitalized, have operated longer, have product offerings that extend beyond our product suite, and have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel, and other resources than we have. In addition, while we believe that there is a relatively low threat of new internet-only entrants due to the nature of our products, the growth opportunities presented by e-commerce could outweigh these challenges and result in increased competition.
Suppliers
 We purchase materials from both domestic and foreign suppliers.  We have relationships with qualified suppliers who allow us to access products in a timely and efficient manner and have not historically experienced significant disruption in supply of the products we purchase. In some instances, we have agreements with our suppliers, but these agreements are generally terminable by either party without notice or on limited notice. Many of our suppliers also offer us favorable terms based on the volume of our purchases.

Backlog
 For our RDS segment, backlog represents the transaction price for contracts for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential modifications. Backlog is not a guarantee of future revenue as contractual commitments may change. There can be no assurance that backlog will result in revenue within the expected timeframe, if at all. We estimate our backlog was $548.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and $574.3 million as of December 31, 2019.
Customer Concentration
 There were no customers that accounted for over 10.0% of total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized revenue from one customer which accounted for 11.4% of total net revenue.  There were no customers that accounted for 10.0% or more of total accounts receivable, as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Cyclicality and Seasonality
 Our businesses are both cyclical and seasonal based on the homebuilding industry in the markets we serve. Because of the timing of installation of our major product lines, which are mainly installed near the end of the construction process, as well as overall housing seasonality for our RDS segment, our sales activity for the RDS segment is normally weighted toward the second half of the calendar year.
 Homebuilding-based businesses are also generally cyclical. Our financial performance will be impacted by economic changes nationally and locally in the markets we serve. The building products supply industry is dependent on new home construction and subject to cyclical market pressures. Our operations are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in supply and demand, national and international economic conditions, labor costs, competition, government regulation, trade policies, and other factors that affect the homebuilding industry such as demographic trends, interest rates, single-family housing starts, employment levels, consumer confidence, and the availability of credit to homebuilders, contractors and homeowners.
 After the dramatic recession that ran from 2007 to 2009, there have been over ten years of relatively steady growth. While we believe that the underlying fundamentals of demand for new housing units and residential investment are indicative of continued growth into the future, there can be no assurance that macroeconomic or other factors will not change unexpectedly and cause a downturn in housing construction.
 Human Capital
 We employ approximately 1,300 employees serving in 53 distinct locations across the nation.  These employees perform a number of functions, from supply, delivery, and installation of our products to administrative and back office roles to ensure the business functions as efficiently as possible.  Our employees are integral to our business and its success, as many have specialized knowledge concerning building products, techniques, supply chain, and in many instances, trade-specific knowledge such as flooring, carpentry, or countertop installation that allows our Company to successfully perform.  A key focus and objective for the Company is that we attract and retain highly qualified individuals while fostering an unwavering commitment toward inclusion and diversity.  To this end, the Company offers competitive pay, health and wellness benefits, and employee development and training programs.  Additionally, over the last year, the Company has developed and deployed a management training program which aims to identify, train, and promote employees and prospective employees with demonstrated leadership potential and business acumen to further enhance the Company’s talent base.  The program will place trainees in varying positions in the business for 3-month terms over the course of a year, followed by a capstone project and presentation to the Company’s senior leadership.  The intent of the program is to develop the skills and business understanding of each of the Managers-in-Training (“MIT”), resulting in a formal job offer at the end of the program.

Finally, employee safety remains one of the Company’s highest priorities.  In this regard, the Company has an on-going safety training program, conducts regular safety assessments, and has created a multi-disciplinary COVID-19 Response Team to address safety concerns presented by the recent novel coronavirus pandemic.  Because our operations were deemed essential to the critical infrastructure, a large portion of our workforce continued operating in place throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  Recognizing this fact, and as evidence of the Company’s focus on safety, the Company made several significant operational adjustments to address potential safety concerns.  This included modifying attendance policies to allow many employees to work remotely, implementation of daily self-assessments to safeguard our employees working on job sites or in the office, requiring face coverings to be worn in all locations, providing access to personal protective equipment and limiting domestic and international travel.  
 We are proud of our employees and continue to make significant investments and review measures to promote diversity, and attract and retain talented employees, while ensuring a safe workplace at each of our operating sites.
