Overview
 We are a clinical-stage, oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company with a vision of transforming lives with safer, more effective therapies. We aim to build a commercial stage enterprise to maximize our impact on the treatment of cancer. We are advancing potential first-in-class and best-in-class antibody-based therapeutics created using our Probody® therapeutic technology platform that could meaningfully improve outcomes for cancer patients. Our proprietary and unique Probody technology platform is designed to enable “conditional activation” of antibody-based drugs within the tumor while minimizing drug activity in healthy tissues and circulation. Our platform is built on a strong foundation of tumor biology expertise including deep knowledge of tumor-associated enzymes known as proteases. Proteases are tightly controlled in normal tissues but often poorly regulated and active in tumor microenvironments where they play important roles in cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. Leveraging our deep scientific knowledge, we conceived of and constructed our Probody therapeutic platform which allows us to genetically engineer therapeutic antibodies to contain protease-cleavable masks. Our masking strategy is designed to reduce antibody binding to targets until the mask is removed by proteases in the tumor microenvironment, providing more selective targeting of the tumor. We believe this innovative approach has the potential to improve cancer treatment in three ways: 

1) | Enhancing a potential product’s “therapeutic window,” the balance between tolerability and activity;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Allowing the pursuit of high potential targets that were previously considered “undruggable” due to their ubiquitous expression on normal tissues; and
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Enabling the development of new combination therapies that are otherwise poorly tolerated.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have entered into multiple partnerships with some of the world’s leading biotech and pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie Inc., (“AbbVie”), Amgen, Inc. (“Amgen”), Astellas Pharma Inc. (“Astellas”), and Bristol Myers Squibb Company (“Bristol Myers Squibb”), which allow us to broaden the application of our technology and potentially expedite the development of Probody therapeutics. 
 We have utilized our Probody platform to build a promising pipeline of conditional Probody therapeutics that encompasses five novel product candidates, four of which are in Phase 2 clinical studies. These investigational products include the conditionally activated antibody-drug conjugates (“ADCs”) praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009, targeting CD166) and CX-2029 (targeting CD71), and the Probody immune checkpoint inhibitors pacmilimab (CX-072, targeting PD-L1) and BMS-986249 (targeting CTLA-4). We also have two preclinical agents in investigational new drug (“IND”)-enabling studies - a conditionally activated ADC targeting EpCAM/Trop-1 (CX-2043) and a conditionally activated T-cell engaging bispecific antibody targeting EGFR and CD3 (CX-904).

In 2020, we focused our internal clinical development efforts on advancing praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009) and CX-2029, two of our conditionally activated ADCs, into Phase 2 clinical studies. The Phase 2 clinical study of praluzatamab ravtansine is focused on breast cancer, evaluating both monotherapy and the combination with pacmilimab, our wholly-owned anti-PD-L1 conditionally activated checkpoint inhibitor. CX-2029 is being evaluated as monotherapy in a Phase 2 clinical study in four different cancer types, including squamous non-small cell lung cancer (“sqNSCLC”), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (“HNSCC”), esophageal and gastro-esophageal junction cancers, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”). Our partner, Bristol Myers Squibb is continuing the clinical development of two Probodies, BMS-986249 and BMS-986288, directed against the checkpoint target CTLA-4. In a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, BMS-986249 is being evaluated in a randomized fashion in patients with previously-untreated metastatic melanoma. In addition, the trial has been modified to include three additional single-arm cohorts: advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (“TNBC”). BMS-986288 continues to be evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study. Our conditionally activated ADC, CX-2043, targets Trop-1 or epithelial cell adhesion molecule (“EpCAM”) and we are working towards a potential IND filing in late 2021. Additionally, our collaboration with Amgen has advanced our first T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody targeting the CD3 receptor on T cells and the epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) on tumor cells. We are working towards a potential IND filing for CX-904 in late 2021.
 
Praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009)
 Our wholly-owned lead product candidate, praluzatamab ravtansine, is a potential first-in-class conditionally activated ADC directed against CD166, a tumor target previously considered undruggable due to its high expression on normal tissues. Because praluzatamab ravtansine is designed to remain masked in circulation, in order to minimize its binding to normal tissues, we believe we can address this new target that is poorly suited for conventional ADCs because of its widespread presence on normal cells and tissues. We have completed and previously reported data from a Phase 1 dose-finding, multi-cohort study involving heavily-pretreated patients in which we observed encouraging anti-cancer activity in patients with TNBC and hormone receptor-positive (“HR+”), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (“HER2”)-non-amplified breast cancer, among others. In December 2020, we initiated a new three-arm Phase 2 study in these two breast cancer subtypes, using 7 mg/kg administered every three weeks as the recommended dose. The first two arms, Arms A and B, will evaluate praluzatamab ravtansine as monotherapy; Arm A in patients with HR+, HER2-non-amplified breast cancer and Arm B in patients with TNBC. Arm C will study praluzatamab ravtansine in combination with pacmilimab (CX-072) in patients with TNBC. We expect initial data to be available in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 CX-2029
 Our second lead conditionally activated ADC is CX-2029 which we are advancing in a global co-development collaboration with our partner AbbVie. This program is intended to open a therapeutic window for targeting CD71, also known as the transferrin receptor 1 (“TfR1”). CD71 is a cell surface protein essential for iron uptake in dividing cells and is highly expressed in a number of solid and hematologic cancers. However, given its central role in iron metabolism, CD71 is present on most healthy cells and is thought to be undruggable with conventional ADCs. In 2020, we completed the Phase 1 dose-escalation phase of our ongoing Phase 1/2 study of CX-2029, for which we received a $40 million milestone payment from AbbVie. In November 2020, we expanded this study into a four-cohort Phase 2 cohort expansions evaluating CX-2029 as a monotherapy at the dose of 3 mg/kg administered every three weeks in patients with sqNSCLC, HNSCC, esophageal and gastro-esophageal junction cancers, and DLBCL. Initial data are expected in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 BMS-986249 and BMS-986288 
 In collaboration with our partner, Bristol Myers Squibb, we are studying two CTLA-4-directed Probody therapeutics generated with our Probody platform. BMS-986249, a Probody version of ipilimumab, was advanced in February 2020 into a randomized Phase 2 study in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab in patients with previously-untreated metastatic melanoma, triggering a $10.0 million milestone payment to us. This study has been modified to include three additional single-arm cohorts: advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. The second anti-CTLA-4 antibody BMS-986288, a Probody version of non-fucosylated ipilimumab, is being examined in a Phase 1 study as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in patients with selected advanced solid tumors.

Preclinical programs
 We are working towards submitting INDs during 2021 for two of our preclinical programs, CX-2043 and CX-904.
 CX-2043 is our third conditionally activated ADC and is directed against Trop-1 or EpCAM, another target that is highly expressed on a wide variety of tumor types but is considered difficult to drug due to its wide expression on normal tissues. This program was originally developed by ImmunoGen, Inc. (“ImmunoGen”), utilizing our Probody technology and ImmunoGen’s next-generation linker chemistry and novel maytansinoid payload, DM-21. We in-licensed exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to CX-2043 from ImmunoGen in 2019.
 CX-904 is our most advanced program in the new and promising modality of T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies (“TCBs”). CX-904 is a conditionally activated epidermal growth factor receptor-CD3 (“EGFR-CD3”) TCB which we have partnered with Amgen. While TCBs are designed to direct the activity of cytotoxic T cells to tumors and are highly potent, their development for solid tumor indications has been challenging due to significant on-target, off-tumor toxicities. We believe such toxicity could be reduced using our Probody platform by localizing the activity of TCBs to the tumor microenvironment.
 The successful development of our product candidates involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates. If our Probody therapeutic technology and product candidates generally prove to be ineffective, unsafe or commercially unviable, it would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.  See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our product candidates and our research and development projects.  
 Our Corporate Strategy
 We are utilizing our industry-leading, proprietary, and differentiated Probody platform to develop a robust pipeline of antibody-based therapies to improve the lives of people with cancer and to build a long-term, multi-product, commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company. We aim to achieve this goal by:

• | Advancing potentially first-in-class therapies against high potential, novel targets that have not yet been drugged because of broad expression in healthy tissue. Our conditionally activated ADCs, praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009) and CX-2029, targeting CD166 and CD71, respectively, are our most advanced programs in this class.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing novel and improved combination therapies based on validated immuno-oncology targets and pathways that have the potential to improve outcomes for cancer patients. Our partner, Bristol Myers Squibb, is progressing two Probody anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors, BMS-986249 and BMS-986288, in combination with nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor. We are studying our conditionally activated anti-PD-L1 therapeutic candidate, pacmilimab (CX-072), in combination with praluzatamab ravtansine in patients with TNBC.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Positioning ourselves at the cutting edge of anti-cancer research and development by creating new potent therapeutic antibody formats. We are working towards filing an IND in late 2021 for CX-904, our conditionally activated version of an EGFR-CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific that we have partnered with Amgen.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Partnering with leading global biopharmaceutical companies to access capital, additional resources and expertise, as well as increase the number of Probody therapeutic candidates being advanced into clinical studies. To date, we have formed several strategic alliances with major multinational drug companies, including AbbVie, Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb, and most recently in 2020, Astellas.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing to access technologies or programs that complement our Probody platform and our pipeline through licenses or acquisitions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fostering a unique, patient-focused culture of execution, alignment and accountability centered around our vision, mission and values.

Our Probody Platform
 Localization of therapeutic antibody activity within disease tissue is of increasing interest in the biopharmaceutical industry due to the desire to maximize the activity of antibody-based biologics while reducing their toxicities. At CytomX, we call our approach to therapeutic antibody localization our Probody platform. A Probody therapeutic consists of three components: an active anti-cancer antibody, a mask for the antibody, and a protease-cleavable linker which connects the mask to the antibody. The mask is a peptide designed to disguise the active binding site of the antibody to prevent the therapeutic from binding to the target present on healthy tissue. Probody therapeutics are produced as a single protein by standard antibody production methodology. The following graphic depicts the three components of a Probody therapeutic:
 
Depiction of the structure of a Probody therapeutic and a protease interacting with the Probody to cleave the linker and activate the molecule
 When a Probody therapeutic enters a tumor, it encounters proteases, which are enzymes that cleave proteins and have increased activity in the tumor microenvironment. The proteases in the tumor cleave the linker, releasing the mask and allowing the antibody to bind to the target on the tumor. The following graphic depicts the activation of a Probody therapeutic by proteases:
 
Depiction of how a Probody therapeutic is designed to enter the tumor microenvironment (left), be activated by protease cleavage to remove the mask (middle), thereby enabling the released antibody to bind to the tumor target (right)
 Proteases play an essential role in many aspects of normal physiology, such as digestion of food in the gastrointestinal tract, wound healing and metabolic function. However, uncontrolled protease activity can lead to destruction of essential proteins and tissues. Therefore, proteases are normally very tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms, with only small amounts of extracellular protease activity being detectable in healthy tissues. In contrast, it has been well documented that proteases are not only present, but also activated, in virtually all types of tumors, playing a key role in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. Probody therapeutics are designed to be activated in this protease-rich tumor microenvironment, but not in healthy tissue where proteases are under tight control. Consequently, toxicities that arise from the binding of an antibody to a target in healthy tissues can be minimized, while 
 6


biological activity against the tumor where it is desired can be preserved. We and our partners have demonstrated the potential applicability of our Probody platform across multiple modalities, including ADCs, cancer immunotherapy, and TCBs. 
 Key Advantages of Our Probody Platform
 We believe that our Probody platform provides the following key advantages:
  
• | A novel therapeutic antibody class enabled by our proprietary platform. We believe we have a differentiated technology platform that gives us a substantial competitive advantage supported by more than a decade of research and a strong intellectual property portfolio.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to improve the therapeutic window of antibody-based therapeutics. By engineering our therapeutics to selectively activate in the tumor microenvironment, our Probody product candidates have the potential to improve safety and tolerability.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to combine more effectively with other therapies. We believe the therapeutic window and tumor specificity of our candidates have the potential to reduce the dose-limiting toxicities observed in combination therapies and thus enable new combinations with other cancer therapies that are difficult or impossible to use.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Applicability across many molecular targets. We believe that our technology addresses many different molecular targets expressed by many different kinds of tumors—including targets that are difficult to address because they are also expressed on healthy cells—because Probody therapeutics are designed to have limited interaction with non-cancerous tissues.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Versatility across antibody modalities. We believe that our technology can be applied to most antibody-based therapies, including novel potent modalities like ADCs and TCBs.

Our Lead Product Candidates
 We are leveraging our Probody platform to build a robust pipeline of potential first-in-class anti-cancer therapies. We currently retain worldwide development and commercialization rights to two of our most advanced Probody therapeutics in the clinic, praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009) and pacmilimab (CX-072). Additionally, we are advancing multiple partnered development programs in the clinic, including CX-2029, an anti-CD71 conditionally activated ADC in collaboration with AbbVie, as well as BMS-986249 and BMS-986288, our anti-CTLA-4 Probody programs partnered with Bristol Myers Squibb.
Praluzatamab Ravtansine (CX-2009: CD166-Directed Conditional ADC) Program
 Although there are several ADCs approved for the treatment of cancer in the United States and elsewhere, conventional ADCs have been restricted to targeting proteins that are expressed highly in tumors, but are absent or poorly expressed in healthy tissues, in order to avoid undesirable toxicities. However, few cancer-associated proteins have this desirable profile, thereby limiting the utility of conventional ADCs. 
 We have a broad research program at CytomX aimed at discovering and validating a new class of ADCs taking advantage of the fact that Probody therapeutics are designed to reduce binding of potent anti-cancer therapy to targets in healthy tissues while increasing binding to target in tumor tissue. We believe this unique, conditional approach can open up new classes of ADC targets that were previously deemed unsuitable because of expression on normal tissues. Our therapeutic strategy with conditional ADCs is to leverage targets to achieve binding to tumor cells, and to effect cancer cell killing via a cytotoxic payload conjugated to the antibody. We do not mask the cytotoxic payload in our conditional ADCs and therefore some payload-related toxicities are expected. However, our Probody platform is designed to minimize on target toxicities that otherwise may occur with traditional ADCs. While payload toxicities are still anticipated, they may offer an indication that therapeutically active levels of the drug conjugate are being achieved.  
 Our lead product candidate is praluzatamab ravtansine, a wholly-owned conditionally activated ADC directed against CD166, a novel cell surface target that we have validated at CytomX. CD166 is highly and homogenously expressed in multiple different tumor types but its high expression on normal tissues makes this a difficult target to drug with a traditional ADC therapy.
 As the first ADC that targets CD166, praluzatamab ravtansine is made up of a humanized, conditionally activated antibody that recognizes CD166 and is conjugated with the potent microtubule inhibiting payload DM4, licensed from ImmunoGen. In May 2020 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting (ASCO), we reported data from an ongoing Phase 1 dose-finding, multi-cohort study, in which 96 heavily-pretreated patients were enrolled to receive praluzatamab ravtansine at escalating doses of 0.25 - 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 4 - 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Seven tumor types with high CD166 expression were included in this study: breast carcinoma, epithelial ovarian carcinoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, cholangiocarcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, and castration-resistant prostate carcinoma. Praluzatamab ravtansine was generally well tolerated at doses up to 7 mg/kg administered every three 
 7


weeks, with no dose-limiting toxicities reported at doses up to 7 mg/kg. DM4-related toxicities, including ocular, neuropathic, and hepatic were higher in frequency at dose equivalents greater than 7 mg/kg dosed at every three weeks compared to 7 mg/kg or lower. The occurrence and severity of ocular adverse events were dose dependent: 20% of patients dosed at ≥8 mg/kg experienced Grade 3+ ocular adverse events; one patient treated at doses ≤ 7 mg/kg had a Grade 3+ ocular adverse event. Preliminary pharmacokinetic (“PK”) data showed that praluzatamab ravtansine circulates predominantly intact at all doses and PK is not strongly influenced by target-mediated drug disposition or anti-drug antibodies.  Evidence of anti-cancer activity for CX-2009 was observed in patients with several tumor types including breast cancer, ovarian cancer and NSCLC.
 These results were updated at the 2020 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium with particular focus on our clinical experience with CX-2009 in breast cancer. At the time of data cutoff in August 2020, 32 patients with HER2– breast cancer who received ≥4 mg/kg of praluzatamab ravtansine were response evaluable. Two confirmed partial responses were observed in patients with HR+, HER2– subtype, while three unconfirmed responses were observed in patients with TNBC. Clinical benefit rates of 41% and 28% were observed at 16 and 24 weeks (“CBR16” and “CBR 24”), respectively, with all four patients with TNBC who achieved CBR16 maintaining it at CBR24. Adverse events were consistent with data previously reported.

 According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 284,200 new cases of breast cancer are expected in the United States in 2021, making it the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. HR+/HER2‒ and TNBC subtypes, collectively HER2-non-amplified, is the largest segment of breast cancer, accounting for greater than 80% of patients with advanced breast cancer. Patients with HR+ breast cancer are treated with hormone-based therapy, which can be single-agent or combination therapy (including CDK4/6 or mTOR 
 9


inhibition). If the cancer progresses, patients may require more aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy. The patients that progress despite these therapies represent a significant unmet need for more efficacious treatment options.
 CX-2029 (anti-CD71 Conditional ADC) Program in Collaboration with AbbVie 
 We are collaborating with AbbVie on the development of CX-2029, a CD71-directed conditionally activated ADC. CD71, also known as TfR1, is a cell surface protein that is essential for iron uptake in dividing cells. CD71 is highly expressed in a number of solid and hematologic cancers and has attractive molecular properties for efficient internalization of ADCs and cytotoxic payloads to tumor cells. However, CD71 is present on most healthy cells, and is thought to be an undruggable target with conventional ADCs. Our preclinical work has shown that conventional ADC to CD71 is lethal at sub-therapeutic doses, rendering it an undevelopable drug.
 We used our Probody platform to design and construct CX-2029, a conditionally activated anti-CD71 ADC conjugated with the tubulin inhibitor, monomethyl auristatin E (“MMAE”), as the payload. In preclinical studies, CX-2029 demonstrated potent anticancer effects in various animal tumor models. For CX-2029 to be effective in patients, we believe we need to achieve dose levels in the 2 - 4 mg/kg range in cancer patients. 
 In 2020, we completed the dose-escalation phase of an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study, for which we received a $40 million milestone payment from AbbVie. 
 In May 2020, we disclosed preliminary data from the Phase 1/2 study that forty-five patients with advanced solid tumors had been enrolled into the Phase 1 study to receive CX-2029 intravenously at 8 escalating dose cohorts ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg every three weeks. At doses of 0.25 – 5 mg/kg, more than 90 percent of CX-2029 circulated predominantly as the intact species. CX-2029 was generally well tolerated at doses up to 3 mg/kg, with infusion related reactions, anemia, and neutropenia/leukopenia as the most common treatment related adverse events. Anemia and neutropenia are commonly observed with the MMAE payload, and anemia was managed with transfusions and supportive care.  The etiology of anemia is under investigation and is likely multifactorial, including MMAE-related and CD71 expression on red blood cell precursors. No CX-2029 treatment related deaths were reported, and no patient withdrew from the trial due to anemia.

Evidence of target lesion reduction was observed principally in patients with tumors of squamous histology, including confirmed partial responses in two patients with sqNSCLC and in one patient with HNSCC among 21 response-evaluable patients treated at doses ≥2 mg/kg of CX-2029.

The spider plot demonstrating responses and durability for patients with sqNSCLC and HNSCC who received CX-2029 at doses ≥2 mg/kg every three weeks is shown below. CX-2029 showed clinical activity in patients with heavily-pretreated sqNSCLC and HNSCC, with 3 of 4 sqNSCLC patients achieving at least stable disease, including two confirmed partial responses (3 mg/kg, n=1; 5 mg/kg, n=1), and 7 of 8 HNSCC patients achieving at least stable disease, including one confirmed partial response at 3 mg/kg and one prolonged stable disease ongoing at ~25 weeks as of data cut off.

Initial results are expected in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from all cancers globally, resulting in more than 1.8 million deaths per year. Greater than 80% of lung cancers are NSCLC and the main subtypes of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, with squamous cell representing approximately 30%. Head and neck cancers include cancers in the larynx, throat, lips, mouth, nose, and salivary glands, and represent the 6th most common cancer worldwide, resulting in 350,000 deaths annually, whereas it is the 8th most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States, accounting for approximately 11,500 deaths annually. The most common types of esophageal cancer are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, with squamous cell accounting for about 90% of the global annual incidence of 456,000. DLBCL is the most common aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, constituting up to 40% of cases globally and more than 18,000 people diagnosed with the malignancy each year in the United States. Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, including the advent of immuno-oncology therapy, significant unmet need remains for these four cancer types.
 Pacmilimab (CX-072: conditionally activated PD-L1 therapeutic) Program
 Our most advanced wholly-owned immuno-oncology product candidate is pacmilimab, a conditionally activated therapeutic against PD-L1, a clinically and commercially validated cancer target. The PD pathway consists principally of two targets: PD-1, which is typically expressed on T-cells, and PD-L1, which is typically expressed on the tumor cells as well as on healthy tissue. In healthy tissue, PD-1 and PD-L1 work together to negatively regulate immune response and maintain tolerance between the immune system and healthy tissue. Tumors, however, upregulate PD-L1 to evade immune surveillance by the host’s immune system. Therefore, development of antibodies against PD-1 and PD-L1 have become a key focal point in cancer drug development, with three PD-1 antibodies nivolumab (Opdivo®), pembrolizumab (Keytruda®), and cemiplimab (Libtayo®) and three PD-L1 antibodies atezolizumab (Tecentriq®), durvalumab (Imfinzi®), and avelumab (Bavencio®) approved by the FDA as of January 2021, with many other PD pathway inhibitors in clinical development. In addition to assessment as single agents, PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies have been studied extensively as the centerpiece of oncology combination therapies.  
 While inhibitors of the PD-L1 and/or PD-1 pathway offer the potential for clinical benefit in patients with a wide-variety of cancer types, there are a number of risks imposed by administration of these agents. According to U.S. labels for Opdivo, Keytruda, Tecentriq, Bavencio, and Imfinzi, the most common side effects (defined as either >15% or >20%, depending upon the agent) that were observed with commercially available anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 agents include: fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea, constipation, cough, musculoskeletal pain, back pain, abdominal pain, arthralgia, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, peripheral edema, infusion-related reaction, rash, asthenia, pruritus, headache, and pyrexia.
 Combining a PD pathway inhibitor with another anti-cancer agent often results in significantly greater toxicity than monotherapy alone. One example is the combination of atezolizumab and paclitaxel protein-bound, or nab-paclitaxel, which was approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC whose tumors express ≥ 1% of PD-L1, as determined by an FDA approved test. According to data reported in 2018 in The New England Journal of Medicine, the combination of atezolizumab at a dose of 840 mg and nab-paclitaxel at a dose of 100 mg per square meter of body-surface resulted in Grade 3/4 treatment related adverse events (“TRAEs”) in 48.7% of the patients treated versus 42.2% in the placebo-nab-paclitaxel group, and drug discontinuations in 6.4% of the patients treated, compared to 1.4% in the placebo group.  
 We believe that a locally activated Probody therapeutic targeting PD-L1 has the potential to maintain the anti-tumor activity of the PD pathway blockade while reducing the autoimmunity that results from blocking such pathway systemically. As such, we believe that pacmilimab has the potential to enable combination therapies that cannot be appropriately dosed because of synergistic toxicity, and ultimately that pacmilimab may have the potential to play an important role in combination therapy. Pacmilimab may also ultimately prove to be a safer monotherapy than existing PD inhibitors which could have specific applications in certain clinical settings. 
 15


In our Phase 1/2 study of pacmilimab as monotherapy in patients with heavily-pretreated cancers we reported in May 2020 that a total of 114 patients with seven different tumor types were enrolled to receive pacmilimab at the 10 mg/kg dose. As of an April 20, 2020 data cutoff, pacmilimab monotherapy continued to demonstrate durable anti-tumor activity in patients with IO-sensitive tumors such as TNBC, anal squamous cell carcinoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and tumors with high mutational burden. This conditionally activated therapeutic was generally well tolerated by patients, with Grade 3/4 TRAEs of 10% and 5.9% for patients who received pacmilimab monotherapy < 6 months and ≥ 6 months, respectively. Long term patients experienced fewer (~21%) immune-related adverse events (“irAEs”) and had no grade 3+ irAEs suggesting that tolerability can impact duration of treatment.
 
Activity and Durability Observed in IO-Responsive Tumors with Pacmilimab Monotherapy at 10 mg/kg Dose
 Based on this potentially differentiated profile of a favorable tolerability and clear evidence of anti-cancer activity, we are studying pacmilimab in combination with praluzatamab ravtansine in a Phase 2 study in TNBC.
 In 2019, we initiated PROCLAIM-CX-072-002, a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating the conditionally activated anti-PD-L1 pacmilimab in combination with ipilimumab. In March 2020, we made the strategic decision to terminate this study. The decision followed a re-evaluation of the evolving clinical, competitive and commercial landscapes in immuno-oncology, along with impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This decision allowed for resources to be redirected towards our potential first-in-class assets, including the combination of pacmilimab and praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009) in TNBC.
 BMS-986249 and BMS-986288 (anti-CTLA-4 Probody Therapeutics) Programs in Collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb
 In collaboration with our partner, Bristol Myers Squibb, we are developing BMS-986249 and BMS-986288, Probody versions of ipilimumab. Ipilimumab, sold under the brand name Yervoy®, is a monoclonal antibody that targets CTLA-4, a checkpoint protein receptor that downregulates the immune system. In the United States, ipilimumab has been approved by the FDA to treat melanoma as a single agent and in combination with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, for colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, NSCLC, and renal cell carcinoma. While treatment with ipilimumab as a monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab has resulted in clinically meaningful anti-tumor activity in these malignancies, ipilimumab has a narrow therapeutic window and the FDA approved label has a black box warning about potential severe and fatal immune-related adverse events. We believe our CTLA-4-targeting Probody therapeutic may be able to effectively localize the anti-CTLA-4 antibody activity to the tumor microenvironment, thereby limiting systemic toxicities normally seen with ipilimumab, which could improve the benefit/risk profile of anti-CTLA-4 containing treatment regimens.
 
In an ongoing Phase 1/2 study conducted by Bristol Myers Squibb in patients with advanced cancers, Bristol Myers Squibb reported at ASCO 2020 preliminary data indicating that escalating doses of BMS-986249 ranging from 240 mg to 2400 mg (approximately 3 to 30 mg/kg of ipilimumab) were found to be generally well tolerated, either as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab. In February 2020, Bristol Myers Squibb initiated a randomized Phase 2 study cohort expansion in combination with nivolumab in patients with previously-untreated unresectable stage III-IV melanoma and we received a $10.0 million milestone payment from them.

This study has been modified to include three additional single-arm cohorts: advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. 
 
For BMS-986288, a Probody version of non-fuscosylated ipilimumab, Bristol Myers Squibb is evaluating its safety and efficacy alone and in combination with nivolumab in an ongoing Phase 1/2a study in patients with selected advanced solid tumors. 
 Preclinical Product Candidates and Research
 We are actively broadening the application of our Probody platform technology to multiple other product candidates, including additional potential first-in-class conditionally activated ADC product candidates and investigational TCB product candidates.
 Anti-Trop-1 (EpCAM) Conditionally Activated ADC Program
 Trop-1 or epithelial cell adhesion molecule (“EpCAM”) is a target that is highly expressed on a wide variety of tumor types. It has been, however, a difficult target to drug as it is also expressed widely on normal tissues. An EpCAM-targeting conditional ADC program was initially developed by ImmunoGen utilizing our Probody technology and ImmunoGen’s next-generation linker chemistry and novel maytansinoid payload, DM-21. At the 2018 European Antibody Congress and the 2019 American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting, ImmunoGen reported pre-clinical data from this program showing CX-2043 elicited potent tumor regression in multiple tumor models, while minimizing on-target toxicities outside the tumor microenvironment. In late 2019, we obtained a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license from ImmunoGen to this anti-EpCAM ADC program, for which we are working towards submitting an IND in late 2021. 
 Conditionally Activated TCB Platform
 We have also extended our Probody platform to the new and promising modality of T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies (“TCBs”).  Conventional TCBs are a highly potent therapeutic modality designed to direct the activity of cytotoxic T cells to tumors. TCBs such as the BiTE, Blincyto®, a CD19-directed TCB commercialized by Amgen, have shown clinical activity in hematologic malignancies, but development of TCBs for solid tumor indications is proving challenging. Due to their high potency, TCBs can target normal tissues with low antigen expression, resulting in significant on-target, off-tumor toxicity that limits dosing to low levels. We are exploring the potential of our Probody technology to improve the therapeutic window for TCBs in solid tumors. 
 
Our most advanced program in this modality is CX-904, a conditionally activated epidermal growth factor receptor-CD3 (“EGFR-CD3”) TCB, which we partnered with Amgen.  In in vitro preclinical studies, CX-904 was shown to reduce cytotoxicity up to 100,000-fold as compared to an unmasked EGFR-CD3 TCB. CX-904 also induced tumor regressions and demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in established tumor models. Additionally, CX-904 is predicted to be tolerated at efficacious doses in humans. We are working towards submission of an IND in late 2021. 
 Pre-clinical Research
 We continue to conduct extensive research to create future generations of product candidates based on our Probody technology. Our broad Probody therapeutic technology platform and lead product candidates are supported by more than a decade of thorough scientific research and strong intellectual property. We have established a broad worldwide patent estate of at least 150 issued, owned and co-owned patents and at least 325 pending, owned and co-owned patent applications. We also have an exclusive license from University of California, Santa Barbara (“UCSB”) to three patent families covering screening tools to identify masks and substrates.  
 Our Collaborations
We believe that the Probody platform has broad applicability across a number of targets and antibody formats. We have leveraged strategic partnering to (a) extend the reach of our therapeutic opportunity, and (b) bring in significant non-dilutive capital into the Company. Since 2013, we have entered into collaborations with AbbVie, Amgen, Astellas, Bristol Myers Squibb and ImmunoGen, among others, to enable development of certain Probody therapeutics. In constructing each of these collaborations, our primary objectives were to collaborate with leading biopharmaceutical players to realize the potential of Probody therapeutics; gain meaningful near-term funding and/or technology access to enable advancement of our wholly-owned Probody therapeutics pipeline; broaden the number of Probody therapeutics that ultimately reach the clinic; and retain significant milestones, royalties, and in some cases product rights, for long-term upside.

AbbVie Ireland Unlimited Company
 In April 2016, we entered into two agreements with AbbVie, a CD71 Co-Development and Licensing Agreement (the “CD71 Agreement”) and the Discovery Agreement (the Discovery Agreement, together with the CD71 Agreement are collectively referred to as the “AbbVie Agreements”). Under the terms of the CD71 Agreement, we and AbbVie are co-developing CX-2029, a conditionally activated antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC against CD71, and we are responsible for pre-clinical and early clinical development. AbbVie will be responsible for later development and commercialization, with global late-stage development costs shared between the two companies. We will assume 35% of the net profits or net losses related to later development unless we opt-out. If we opt-out from participation of co-development of CX-2029, AbbVie will have sole right and responsibility for the further development, manufacturing and commercialization of CX-2029. 
 Under the CD71 Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $20.0 million in April 2016, and a milestone payment of $40.0 million in May 2020 for completion of the dose-escalation phase of the ongoing Phase 1/2 study. We are currently eligible to receive up to $430.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties on ex-US sales in the high teens to low twenties if we participate in the co-development of CX-2029 subject to a reduction in such royalties if we opt-out from the co-development of the CD71 conditionally activated ADC. Our share of later stage co-development costs for CX-2029 is capped, provided that AbbVie may offset our co-development cost above the capped amounts from future payments such as milestone payments and royalties.
 Under the terms of the Discovery Agreement, AbbVie received exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize conditionally activated ADCs against up to two targets, one of which was selected in March 2017 and the second of which was selected in July 2019. We shall perform research services to discover the Probody therapeutics and create conditionally activated ADCs for the nominated collaboration targets. From that point, AbbVie shall have sole right and responsibility for development and commercialization of products comprising or containing such conditionally activated ADCs (“Discovery Licensed Products”). 
 Under the Discovery Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $10.0 million in April 2016 and we received an additional upfront payment of $10.0 million in July 2019 upon the selection by AbbVie of the second target and the satisfaction of certain performance conditions under the CD71 Agreement. We are also eligible to receive up to $265.0 million for each target in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments as well as royalties in the high single to low teens from commercial sales of any resulting conditionally activated ADCs. 
 Amgen, Inc. 
 In September 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Amgen Agreement”) with Amgen. Pursuant to the Amgen Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $40.0 million in October 2017. Concurrent with the entry into the Amgen Agreement, Amgen purchased 1,156,069 shares of our common stock for $20.0 million. 
 Under the terms of the Amgen Agreement, we and Amgen are co-developing a conditionally activated T-cell engaging bi-specific therapeutic targeting EGFR (“EGFR Products”). We are responsible for early-stage development of EGFR Products and all related costs (up to certain pre-set costs and certain limits based on clinical study size). Amgen will be responsible for late-stage development, commercialization, and all related costs of EGFR Products. Following early-stage development, we will have the right to elect to participate financially in the global co-development of EGFR Products with Amgen, during which we would bear certain of the worldwide development costs for EGFR Products and Amgen would bear the rest of such costs (the “EGFR Co-Development Option”). If we exercise our EGFR Co-Development Option, we will share in somewhat less than 50% of the profit and losses from sales of such EGFR Products in the U.S., subject to certain caps, offsets, and deferrals. If we choose not to exercise our EGFR Co-Development Option, we will not bear any costs of later stage development. We are eligible to receive up to $455.0 million in development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments for EGFR Products, and royalties in the low-double digit to mid-teen percentage of worldwide commercial sales, provided that if we exercise our EGFR Co-Development option, we shall only receive royalties in the low-double digit to mid-teen percentage of commercial sales outside of the United States.
 Amgen also has the right to select a total of up to three targets, including the two additional targets discussed below. We and Amgen will collaborate in the research and development of conditionally activated T-cell engaging bi-specifics products directed against such targets. Amgen has selected one such target (the “Amgen Other Product”). If Amgen exercises its option within a specified period of time, it can select two such additional targets (the “Amgen Option Products” and, together with the Amgen Other Product, the “Amgen Products”). Except with respect to preclinical activities to be conducted by us, Amgen will be responsible, at its expense, for the development, manufacture, and commercialization of all Amgen Products. If Amgen exercises all of its options and advances all three of the Amgen Products, we are eligible to receive up to $950.0 million in upfront, development, regulatory, and commercial milestones and tiered high single-digit to low-teen percentage royalties. 
 18


We have the option to select, from programs specified in the Amgen Agreement, an existing pre-clinical stage T-cell engaging bispecific product from the Amgen pre-clinical pipeline.  We will be responsible, at our expense, for converting this program to a conditionally activated T-cell engaging bispecific product, and thereafter, be responsible for development, manufacturing, and commercialization of the product (“CytomX Product”). Amgen is eligible to receive up to $203.0 million in development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments for the CytomX Product, and tiered mid-single digit to low double-digit percentage royalties.
 Astellas Pharma Inc 
 In March 2020, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Astellas Agreement”) with Astellas, pursuant to which we and Astellas will collaborate on the research, development and commercialization of T-cell engaging bi-specific antibody products (“Products”) directed to CD3 and selected tumor antigen targets using our Probody® platform and other proprietary technology. Under the Astellas Agreement, we granted Astellas an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize Products in all fields. Astellas may select up to four targets to develop, with an option to expand to six targets. We will lead preclinical research and discovery activities up to clinical candidate selection for Products directed against up to four targets. Astellas will lead preclinical and clinical development of and obtaining regulatory approval for all Products. Astellas will be responsible for commercializing each Product, provided that we will have the option to elect to co-commercialize certain Products with Astellas in the United States, subject to the terms of a separate commercialization agreement to be entered into between Astellas and us.
 Under the terms of the Astellas Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $80 million, and Astellas will be responsible for funding the cost of preclinical research and discovery activities of both parties for all Products and for funding the cost of development and commercialization of all Products worldwide. If Astellas exercises its option to expand to six targets, we will be eligible to receive future preclinical, clinical and commercial milestones of approximately $2.5 billion. Astellas will pay us tiered royalties on global net sales of Products from high single digit to mid-teens percentages, subject to certain reductions. Astellas’ royalty obligations continue with respect to each country and each Product until the later of (i) the date on which such Product is no longer covered by certain intellectual property rights, (ii) the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country, and (iii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity for such Product in such country.
 In addition, for a specified number of targets, at a pre-specified time prior to the initiation of the first pivotal study of a Product directed against such target, we will have an option to elect to co-fund certain subsequently initiated clinical trials for such Product. If we opt in, we would be responsible for a pre-determined portion of the costs of such trials, subject to specified caps, deferrals and offsets. We would then have the option to elect to co-commercialize such Products in the United States. For any such Products, in lieu of royalties in the United States, we will receive less than 40% of the profits for such Products in the United States and tiered low double digit to mid-teens percentage royalties on net sales of such Products outside of the United States, subject to certain reductions. 
 Bristol Myers Squibb Company
 In May 2014, we and Bristol Myers Squibb entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “BMS Agreement”) to discover and develop compounds for use in human therapeutics aimed at multiple immuno-oncology targets using our Probody therapeutic technology. 
 Under the terms of the BMS Agreement, we granted Bristol Myers Squibb exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Probody therapeutics for up to four oncology targets, two of which were selected upon the execution of the BMS Agreement.  Pursuant to the BMS Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $50.0 million and were initially entitled to receive contingent payments of up to an aggregate of $1,217.0 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, which can be reduced by any such payments received or by any termination of targets being pursued. We are entitled to royalty payments in the mid-single digit to low double digits percentage from potential future sales. We also receive research and development service fees.  Bristol Myers Squibb has terminated certain targets from the BMS Agreement, as described below.
 In January 2016, Bristol Myers Squibb selected the third target pursuant to the BMS Agreement and paid us $10.0 million. In December 2016, Bristol Myers Squibb selected the fourth and its final target pursuant to the BMS Agreement and paid us $15.0 million.  In December 2016, Bristol Myers Squibb selected BMS-986249, a CTLA-4 Probody therapeutic, as a clinical candidate pursuant to the BMS Agreement, which triggered a $2.0 million pre-clinical milestone payment to us. In November 2017, Bristol Myers Squibb received acceptance of the IND for BMS-986249 from the FDA, which triggered a $10.0 million milestone payment to us. Bristol Myers Squibb recently advanced BMS-986249 into a randomized Phase 2 cohort expansion in patients with metastatic melanoma in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab as part of the larger clinical trial, triggering, in February 2020, a $10.0 million milestone payment from Bristol Myers Squibb to us. This study has been modified to include three additional single-arm cohorts: advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC.  
 19


In September 2019, Bristol Myers Squibb initiated the dose escalation phase of a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of a second anti-CTLA-4-directed therapeutic, BMS-986288, based on a modified version of ipilimumab, administered as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in patients with selected advanced solid tumors. 
 In March 2017, we and Bristol Myers Squibb entered into Amendment Number 1 to Extend Collaboration and License Agreement (“Amendment 1”). Amendment 1 granted Bristol Myers Squibb exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Probody therapeutics for up to six additional oncology targets and two non-oncology targets. Under the terms of Amendment 1, we continued to collaborate with Bristol Myers Squibb to discover and conduct preclinical development of Probody therapeutics against targets selected by Bristol Myers Squibb. Pursuant to Amendment 1, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million and were eligible to receive contingent payments for development, regulatory and sales milestones. We were also entitled to tiered mid-single to low double-digit percentage of royalties from potential future sales
 In February 2021, we and Bristol Myers Squibb entered into Amendment Number 2 to amend the Collaboration and License Agreement (“Amendment 2”), as amended by Amendment 1. Subsequent to Amendment 2, Bristol Myers Squibb has the exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Probody therapeutics for up to five oncology targets. Under the terms of Amendment 2, the period for target selection has been extended and we will continue to collaborate with Bristol Myers Squibb to discover and conduct preclinical development of Probody therapeutics against targets selected by Bristol Myers Squibb. Pursuant to Amendment 2, we are eligible to receive contingent payments for development, regulatory and sales milestones of up to an aggregate of $1,779.0 million. We are also entitled to tiered mid-single to low double-digit percentage of royalties from potential future sales.  
 ImmunoGen, Inc. 
 In January 2014, CytomX and ImmunoGen entered into the Research Collaboration Agreement (the “ImmunoGen Research Agreement”). The ImmunoGen Research Agreement provides us with the right to use ImmunoGen’s ADC technology in combination with our Probody therapeutic technology to create a conditionally activated ADC directed at one specified target under a research license, and to subsequently obtain an exclusive, worldwide development and commercialization license to use ImmunoGen’s ADC technology to develop and commercialize such conditionally activated ADCs. Under the agreement, we provided ImmunoGen with the rights to our Probody therapeutic technology to create conditionally activated ADCs directed at two targets under the research license and to subsequently obtain exclusive, worldwide development and commercialization licenses to develop and commercialize such conditionally activated ADCs. In February 2016, we exercised our option to obtain a development and commercialization license for praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009) pursuant to the terms of the ImmunoGen Research Agreement (the “CX-2009 License”).  In February 2017, ImmunoGen exercised its option to obtain a development and commercialization license for the first of its two targets. ImmunoGen discontinued this program in July 2017 and substitution rights for this program terminated in February 2017. ImmunoGen exercised its second option to obtain a development and commercialization license pursuant to the ImmunoGen Research Agreement (the “ImmunoGen 2017 License”) for a target, EpCAM, in December 2017. At the end of 2019, as a result of a strategic restructuring by ImmunoGen and its decision to out-license certain programs, we obtained a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license to the EpCAM conditionally activated ADC program from ImmunoGen (the “ImmunoGen 2019 License”) and the ImmunoGen 2017 license ended.  
 Under the terms of the ImmunoGen Research Agreement, both we and ImmunoGen were required to perform research activities on behalf of the other party for no monetary consideration. Each party was solely responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of any products resulting from the exclusive development and commercialization license obtained by such party under the agreement. In consideration for the praluzatamab ravtansine License, ImmunoGen is entitled to receive up to $60.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments, up to $100.0 million in sales milestone payments and royalties in the mid to high single digits percentage on the commercial sales of any resulting product. In August 2017, we made a milestone payment of $1.0 million to ImmunoGen for the first patient dosing with praluzatamab ravtansine and in February 2020, we triggered a $3.0 million milestone payment to ImmunoGen for the first dosing of a patient in the praluzatamab ravtansine Phase 2 clinical trial.  Under the ImmunoGen 2019 License, we gained rights to the EpCAM conditionally activated ADC program and, in return, we made an upfront payment, and we will pay certain clinical development, approval and commercialization milestone payments if achieved and royalties on product sales.
 Manufacturing
 Our Probody therapeutic candidates are designed to be produced as fully recombinant antibody prodrugs. Our Probody therapeutic candidates are also designed to maintain the manufacturability benefits of antibodies and leverage well established technologies used for antibody production. We conduct cell line development and process development both in-house and in collaboration with contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CMO”). CMOs are responsible for manufacturing of drug substance and clinical drug product materials. 
 20


Our preferred cell line has been successfully used for manufacturing several antibodies and requires minimal process optimization to establish a process to support early phase manufacturing. We utilize well established production steps typically part of a platform manufacturing process for antibodies. The CMO we have selected has a strong track record in manufacturing therapeutic biologics, including antibodies. Similarly, for our conditionally activated ADC projects we have selected CMOs with strong expertise in clinical/commercial drug conjugate manufacturing and with capabilities for toxin conjugation and fill-finish. Furthermore, our two lead conditionally activated ADC programs incorporate toxin payloads that have an established clinical and regulatory history.  
 To date, we have generally been able to successfully manufacture praluzatamab ravtansine (CX-2009), CX-2029, and pacmilimab (CX-072) for our ongoing early-stage clinical trials with contract manufacturers.  Our partner, Bristol Myers Squibb, has also been successful in independently manufacturing drug product for BMS-986249 and BMS-986288.  However, in November 2019, we encountered a production failure at one of our CMOs that manufactures pacmilimab for our Phase 2 clinical trial. While we contracted with alternative suppliers that were able to timely deliver clinical trial drug product for the then ongoing trial, a failure to do so would have required us to temporarily suspend our ongoing trial for new and ongoing patients.  Furthermore, in order to conduct later-stage clinical trials of our product candidates, including praluzatamab ravtansine, CX-2029, and pacmilimab, and eventually, if approved, commercial products, we will need to manufacture them in larger quantities.  We, or any manufacturing partners, may be unable to successfully increase the manufacturing scale and capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all.  For example, we are currently working with our CMOs to change our manufacturing processes and formulations, scaling up for large drug manufacturing capability for praluzatamab ravtansine and pacmilimab and increasing the term of stability for pacmilimab drug product for late-stage clinical trials and commercialization.  However, we may have to start late-stage trials with our early clinical trial drug product and switch to the late-stage or commercial drug product mid trial. In such event, the FDA will require us to complete bridging studies to compare the earlier stage material with the late-stage or commercial material to assure comparability between the earlier trial material and the late-stage or commercial material.  Changing the formulation and scale up process is a complicated and difficult task.   While we believe we can complete the process successfully, there can be no assurances that the changes we make to the drug product and manufacturing process will be successful or completed in a timely manner or that the FDA will not require additional development steps or studies from those we believe are necessary.  If we are unable scale up our manufacturing capabilities with respect to praluzatamab ravtansine, pacmilimab or any of our other product candidates, increase the life of drug stability of pacmilimab or such other product candidates, or successfully complete the FDA’s bridging requirements, we may not be able to successfully obtain FDA approval and commercialize pacmilimab or such other product candidates in a timely manner or at all. 
 The supply chain for the manufacturing of our product candidates is complicated and can involve many parties. We do not own manufacturing facilities for producing such supplies and rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our clinical trial and preclinical study product supplies. Our clinical trial manufacturing contractors and suppliers are our sole source for their respective manufacturing and supplies. Failure of any of these contractors could affect our ability to have clinical trial material available when needed. This could result in a substantial delay of our clinical trials. For example, for each of praluzatamab ravtansine, CX-2029, and pacmilimab, our manufacturing supply chain includes several contract manufacturers, and failure by any of these manufacturers could result in interruptions of our clinical studies. We do not have any long-term contracts and we do not currently have an alternative to any of our third-party contract manufacturers. Consequently, there can be no assurance that our preclinical and clinical development product supplies will not be limited, interrupted, or of satisfactory quality or continue to be available at acceptable prices. In particular, any replacement of any of our third-party contract manufacturers could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified replacements. In addition, we may encounter issues with transferring technology to a new third-party manufacturer, and we may encounter regulatory delays if we need to move the manufacturing of our products from one third-party manufacturer to another. For example, we were dependent on ImmunoGen under our collaboration for certain steps in the manufacturing of clinical quantities of praluzatamab ravtansine. At the end of 2018, ImmunoGen closed their clinical manufacturing facility in Norwood, Massachusetts provided clinical manufacturing support for the praluzatamab ravtansine program.  We recently completed the transfer of the drug substance manufacturing process from ImmunoGen to a contract manufacturer, where we have an existing relationship and with expertise in the manufacture of antibody drug conjugates at a clinical and commercial scale.  While the manufacturing transfer process has been completed, there can be no assurance that we will not experience a disruption in the supply of praluzatamab ravtansine as a result of such transfer or that we will not experience any other disruption in the manufacturing of praluzatamab ravtansine. 
 
In-Licenses
 License from UCSB
 In August 2010, we entered into an agreement with UCSB, that grants us an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under the patent rights owned by UCSB covering mask and screening technologies relating to the identification and discovery of pro-protein biologics, including masks and substrates, for the identification of pro-proteins, for use in the fields of therapeutics, in vivo diagnostics, and prophylactics (the “UCSB Agreement”). The UCSB Agreement also grants us an exclusive license, with the right to 
 21


sublicense, under UCSB’s interest in certain patent rights we co-own with UCSB covering Probody antibodies and other pro-proteins in the fields of therapeutics, in vivo diagnostics and prophylactics.
 We had no upfront payment obligations under the agreement.  In April 2019, we amended the UCSB Agreement and in connection with the amendment, we paid UCSB $1.0 million and issued 150,000 shares of our common stock to UCSB.  We are obligated to pay to UCSB royalties on net sales of licensed products in the low single digit percentages, subject to annual minimum amounts as well as certain reductions.  We are required to make milestone payments to UCSB on the accomplishment of certain milestones totaling up to $1,075 million for each of the first two indications for each licensed product consisting of a molecule or compound covered by the licensed patent rights. We were also obligated to make a payment to UCSB upon the first occurrence of an IPO or change of control. If the Company sublicenses its rights under the UCSB Agreement, it must pay UCSB a percentage of our total sublicense revenues ranging from the mid-single to mid-teen percentages, which total amount would be first reduced by the aggregate amount of certain research and development related expenses incurred by the Company and other permitted deductions.
 Licenses from ImmunoGen
 
In February 2016, we exercised our option to obtain a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license from ImmunoGen for development and commercialization of products directed against the target selected by us under our research collaboration agreement with ImmunoGen. Additionally, in December 2019, we obtained a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable license to ImmunoGen’s EpCAM conditionally activated ADC program. See the description of the license agreements set forth under the caption “Our Collaborations—ImmunoGen, Inc.” in this Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Competition 
 CytomX is pioneering a new class of antibody therapeutics – the Probody therapeutic platform. The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, including the ADC and immuno-oncology subsectors, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our proprietary Probody platform and scientific expertise in the field of biologics and immuno-oncology provide us with competitive advantages, a wide variety of institutions, including large biopharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. We face substantial competition from biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies developing biopharmaceutical products, particularly with respect to ADC and immuno-oncology therapeutics, where competition is intense and rapidly evolving. These competitors generally fall within the following categories:
 Masking and conditional activation: Several companies, including AbbVie, Adagene, Amgen, Amunix, BioAtla, Halozyme, Harpoon, Maverick Therapeutics, Pandion Therapeutics, Revitope, Roche, Seagen, Werewolf, and Xilio are exploring antibody masking and/or conditional activation strategies, which could compete with our Probody Platform.
 Antibody-drug conjugates: Several large pharmaceutical companies, such as AbbVie, Daiichi Sankyo, Gilead, Pfizer, Roche, and Takeda are developing ADCs. Two mid-sized companies, ImmunoGen and Seagen are also leaders in this space. In addition, numerous smaller companies have ongoing efforts in the space.
 Cancer immunotherapies: Cancer immunotherapy is one of the most competitive and fastest growing segments of the pharmaceutical industry. Almost every large pharmaceutical company is developing cancer immunotherapies, including Amgen, AstraZeneca PLC, Bristol Myers Squibb, Celgene, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer, Roche Holding Ltd and Sanofi SA. In addition, many large and mid-sized biotech companies such as BeiGene, Incyte, Nektar, and Alkermes have ongoing efforts in cancer immunotherapy. Numerous smaller companies are also working in this space.
 T-cell engaging bispecifics: Several large pharmaceutics companies, such as Amgen, Novartis, and Roche, have on-going efforts in the field of TCBs. In additional, several mid-sized biotech companies such as Macrogenics and Xencor, as well as numerous smaller companies, have ongoing efforts in TCBs. 
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals

before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our products’ entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety and convenience of our product candidates.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover, but is not limited to, our technology platforms, our product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our proprietary reagents and assays, and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, platforms and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in our Probody platform and product candidates. We expect to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, patent term adjustment and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned or controlled by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; to defend against and challenge the assertion by third parties of their purported intellectual property rights; and to operate without the unauthorized infringement of valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 We believe that we have a strong global intellectual property position and substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to our Probody therapeutic technology, platform and product candidates. Our patent portfolio as of February 20, 2021 contains at least 150 issued patents (some of which are co-owned with a third party) and at least 325 pending patent applications (some of which are co-owned with a third party). We have exclusively licensed UCSB’s interest in the co-owned patent family covering Probody and other pro-protein technology in the fields of therapeutics, in vivo diagnostics and prophylactics.

As for the Probody platform, product candidates and processes we develop and commercialize, in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue, where appropriate, patent protection or trade secret protection relating to compositions, methods of manufacture, assay methods, methods of use, treatment of indications, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to product development processes and technology.
 We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we develop new platform technologies and product candidates. To that end, we are prepared to file additional patent applications if our intellectual property strategy requires such filings, or where we seek to adapt to competition or seize business opportunities. Further, we are prepared to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, relating to the new technologies that we develop. In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we often file counterpart patent applications in the European Union and in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial.
 Our currently issued patents will likely expire on dates ranging from 2028 to 2037, unless we receive patent term extension or adjustment as might be available under applicable law. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2028 to 2041, unless we receive patent term extension or adjustment. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 All of our patents and patent applications are subject to risks and uncertainties under U.S. and foreign law. We also rely on trademark registration to protect our trademarks.  For a more comprehensive discussion of risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result of the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates are subject to regulation in the U.S. as biologics, which must be approved by the FDA through the BLA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and their respective implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:

• | refusal to approve pending applications;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | withdrawal of an approval;
--+---------------------------


• | imposition of a clinical hold;
--+-------------------------------


• | warning or untitled letters;
--+-----------------------------


• | seizures or administrative detention of product;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 24



 
• | injunctions, fines, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

BLA Approval Process
 The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to good laboratory practices (“GLPs”), and other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to good clinical practices (“GCPs”), to establish the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidate’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for its particular labeled uses in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Studies
 Once a biologic product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions in a timely manner, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. An institutional review board (“IRB”) at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase 1—The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some therapeutic candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A pivotal study is a clinical study that is designed to meet regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase 3 studies but may consist of Phase 2 studies if the trial design for such Phase 2 provides a reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need. Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain, and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 During the development of a new biologic product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points; specifically, prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before a BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new therapeutic. If a Phase 3 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. If a written agreement is reached, it will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of such “Phase 4” clinical trials as a condition of approval for a BLA.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the safety, purity and potency of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Submission of a BLA to the FDA
 The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for marketed products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use, and whether the facility in which it is being manufactured, processed, packaged, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will 
 26


typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval of the application. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. 
 As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary prior to or during review of the application, the sponsor must submit a REMS as part of its application, and the FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required. A REMS program may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the product’s risks, or other elements to assure safe use, such as limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries.  In addition, all REMS programs must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy following implementation.
 Further, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety and efficacy, and the FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Moreover, changes to the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities may require submission and FDA approval of a new supplement before the changes can be implemented.  A supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that supporting the original approval, and the FDA uses similar procedures in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing original applications.
 Companion Diagnostics
 Some of our product candidates may require use of an in vitro diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval (“PMA”).
 If use of companion diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously with the approval of the biologic product. According to FDA guidance, for novel product candidates such as drugs and therapeutic biologics, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding product candidate should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a product candidate generally will be considered an investigational device unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug or biologic product candidate are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. 
 The FDA generally requires companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval of a PMA for that diagnostic contemporaneously with approval of the therapeutic product. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and pre-clinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s 
 27


safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are also subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive pre-clinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. In addition, as part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States. 
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. 
 A product candidate may be eligible for fast track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
 A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 After a BLA is submitted for a product candidate, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, the BLA may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. Priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date, compared to ten months under standard review.
 Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is 
 28


reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our therapeutic candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product candidate’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product candidate is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant BLA.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCIA”), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to therapeutic candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects either (1) fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or (2) more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a product candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that product candidate. Orphan drug designation entitles the applicant to incentives such as grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and waivers of FDA user fees.  Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product candidate that has Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product candidate for the same indication, except under limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our therapeutic candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product candidate as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product candidate for the same indication or disease. 
 Pediatric Studies
 The Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most therapeutic candidates and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product candidate or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The law requires the FDA to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation. It further requires the FDA to post the PREA Non- Compliance letter and sponsor’s response.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Once a BLA approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the biologic product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product candidate may result in restrictions on the product candidate or even complete withdrawal of the product candidate from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may under some circumstances require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved product that have been commercialized, and the FDA under some circumstances has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product candidate based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
 Any biologic products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:
  
• | record-keeping requirements;
--+-----------------------------


• | reporting of adverse experiences with the product candidate;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | product sampling and distribution requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in-patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved therapeutic products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to 
 30


assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations would also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use if our product candidates are approved. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
 Regulation Outside of the U.S.
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other jurisdictions governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our therapeutic candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company can consider applying for marketing authorization in several European Union member states by submitting its marketing authorization application(s) under a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines derived from biotechnology, orphan medicinal products, or those medicines with an active substance not authorized in the European Union on or before May 20, 2004 intended to treat acquired immune deficiency syndrome (“AIDS”), cancer, neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and optional for those medicines containing a new active substance not authorized in the European Union on or before May 20, 2004, medicines which are highly innovative, or medicines to which the granting of a marketing authorization under the centralized procedure would be in the interest of patients at the European Union-level. The decentralized procedure provides for recognition by European Union national authorities of a first assessment performed by one of the member states. Under this procedure, an identical application for marketing authorization is submitted simultaneously to the national authorities of several European Union member states, one of them being chosen as the “Reference Member State”, and the remaining being the “Concerned Member States”. The Reference Member State must prepare and send drafts of an assessment report, summary of product characteristics and the labelling and package leaflet within 120 days after receipt of a valid marketing authorization application to the Concerned Member States, which must decide within 90 days whether to recognize approval. If any Concerned Member State does not recognize the marketing authorization on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. The mutual recognition procedure is similar to the decentralized procedure except that a medicine must have already received a marketing authorization in at least one of the member states, and that member state acts as the Reference Member State.
 As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made.
 Orphan drugs in the European Union enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product, the marketing authorization holder is unable to supply sufficient quantity of the medicinal product or the marketing authorization holder has given its consent.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of therapeutics have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net 
 31


revenue and results. If these third- party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 Healthcare Reform
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (together, the “ACA”) has had a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to biopharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts, which, through subsequent legislative amendments, will be increased to 70% starting in 2019, off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the former presidential administration to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. By way of example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance.  The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the constitutionality of the ACA in its entirety.  It is unclear how these challenges, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to challenge, repeal, or replace the ACA will impact the ACA, particularly in light of presidential and congressional elections of 2020.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted that impact payment methodologies and reimbursement amounts. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress, which led to aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year starting in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the “ATRA”) which among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 Recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, the 21st Century Cures Act changed the reimbursement methodology for infusion drugs and biologics furnished through durable medical equipment in an attempt to remedy over- and underpayment of certain products. Furthermore, with the new Presidential administration and both houses of Congress potentially under the control of one party, which has promoted substantial changes to the healthcare system and drug pricing rules, some changes are likely.  Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.  We cannot predict the extent of the impact of any changes to any of these laws on us.
 Finally, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing therapeutic pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, therapeutic candidates launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.

Other Healthcare Laws
 We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our product candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician and other health care provider payment and drug pricing transparency laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S., for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion-dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
 The U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The ACA, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians (as defined by statute), teaching hospitals and, beginning in 2022, certain other health care professionals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of pricing and marketing information as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
 Penalties for violating any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply include, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance and imprisonment.
 Data Privacy and Security Laws
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws and non-US laws and regulations (particularly EU laws regarding personal data relating to individuals based in Europe) govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ 
 33


from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.  For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context.
 Environment
 Our third-party manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
