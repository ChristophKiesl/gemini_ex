ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview 
We are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs, biologics and consumer and animal health products. Our oral, injectable, and respiratory delivery technologies address the full diversity of the pharmaceutical industry, including small molecules, biologics, and consumer and animal health products. Through our extensive capabilities and deep expertise in product development, we help our customers take products to market faster, including nearly half of new drug products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") in the last decade. Our advanced delivery technology platforms, including those in our Softgel Technologies and Drug Delivery Solutions segments, our proven formulation, manufacturing, and regulatory expertise, and our broad and deep intellectual property enable our customers to develop more products and better treatments for patients and consumers. Across both development and delivery, our commitment to reliably supply our customers’ and their patients' needs is the foundation for the value we provide; annually, we produce approximately 72 billion doses for nearly 7,000 customer products, or approximately 1 in every 20 doses of such products taken each year by patients and consumers around the world. We believe that through our investments in growth-enabling capacity and capabilities, our ongoing focus on operational and quality excellence, the sales of existing customer products, the introduction of new customer products, our innovation activities and patents, and our entry into new markets, we will continue to benefit from attractive and differentiated margins, and realize the growth potential from these areas. 
We continue to invest in our sales and marketing activities, leading to growth in the number of active development programs for our customers. This has further enhanced our extensive, long-duration relationships and long-term contracts with a broad and diverse range of industry-leading customers. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we did business with 85 of the top 100 branded drug marketers, 23 of the top 25 generics marketers, 23 of the top 25 biologics marketers, and 22 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally. Selected key customers include Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Roche, and Teva. We have many long-standing relationships with our customers, particularly in advanced delivery technologies, where we tend to follow a prescription molecule through all phases of its lifecycle, from the development and launch of the original brand prescription, to generics or over-the-counter switch. A prescription pharmaceutical product relationship with an innovator will often last many years, in several cases, nearly two decades or more, extending from pre-clinical development through the end of the product’s life cycle. We serve customers who require innovative product development, superior quality, advanced manufacturing and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs. Our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers’ molecules to yield final dose forms, and this generally results in the inclusion of Catalent in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings. Both of these factors translate to long-duration supply relationships at an individual product level. 
We believe our customers value us because our depth of development solutions and advanced delivery technologies, intellectual property, consistent and reliable supply, geographic reach, and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of business and product solutions that can be customized to fit their individual needs. Today we employ approximately 1,600 scientists and technicians and hold approximately 1,100 patents and patent applications in advanced delivery, drug and biologics formulation, and manufacturing. The aim of our offerings is to allow our customers to bring more products to market faster, and develop and market differentiated new products that improve patient outcomes. We believe our leading market position, significant global scale, and diversity of customers, offerings, regulatory categories, products, and geographies reduce our exposure to potential strategic and product shifts within the industry. 
We provide a number of proprietary, differentiated technologies, products, and service offerings to our customers across our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions platforms. The core technologies within our advanced delivery technologies platform include softgel capsules, our Zydis oral dissolving tablets, blow-fill-seal unit dose liquids, and a range of other oral, injectable and respiratory technologies. The technologies and service offerings within our development solutions platform span the drug development process, ranging from our OptiForm Solutions Suite for bioavailability enhancement of early-stage molecules, and GPEx and SMARTag platforms for development of biologics and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), to formulation, analytical services, early-stage clinical development, and clinical trials supply, including our unique FastChain demand-led clinical supply solution. Our offerings serve a critical need in the development and manufacturing of difficult-to-formulate products across a number of product types. 
We have advanced our technologies and grown our service offerings over more than 80 years through internal development, strategic alliances, in-licensing, and acquisitions. We initially introduced our softgel capsule technology in the 1930s and have continued to expand our range of new, technologically enhanced offerings. Since fiscal 2013, we have launched OptiShell, OptiMelt, Zydis Nano, Zydis Bio, and OptiPact. In fiscal 2016, we launched OptiForm Solutions Suite and our 
6


FastChain demand-led clinical supply solution. Also in 2016, our customers received regulatory approval for first-to-market products using the OptiShell and ADVASEPT technologies. We have also augmented our portfolio through eleven acquisitions since fiscal 2012, including significantly expanding the scale of our Clinical Supply Services segment through the acquisition of the Aptuit CTS business in February 2012; adding an ADC business through the completion of our acquisition of Redwood Bioscience in October 2014; and extending our particle engineering capabilities via our November 2014 acquisition of Micron Technologies. In fiscal 2017, we continued to extend our capabilities and expertise via two acquisitions, we expanded our early development capabilities, including the addition of spray drying technology into our drug formulation and delivery technologies, through the acquisition of Pharmatek Laboratories, Inc. ("Pharmatek") in September 2016; and we expanded our softgel development and manufacturing network via the February 2017 acquisition of Accucaps Industries Limited ("Accucaps"). We believe our own internal innovation, supplemented by current and future external partnerships and acquisitions, will continue to strengthen and extend our leadership positions in the delivery and development of drugs, biologics, and consumer and animal health products. 

History 
Catalent was formed in April 2007, when affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. ("Blackstone") acquired the core of the Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services ("PTS") segment of Cardinal Health, Inc. ("Cardinal"). Cardinal had created PTS through a series of acquisitions beginning with R.P. Scherer Corporation in 1998. We are a holding company that indirectly owns Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc. ("Operating Company"), which owns, directly or indirectly, all of our operating subsidiaries. Since our 2007 acquisition, we have regularly reviewed our portfolio of offerings and operations in the context of our strategic growth plan, and, as a result, we have sold five businesses and consolidated operations at five facilities, integrating them into the remaining facility network. We have also actively acquired new businesses and facilities, completing eleven transactions since fiscal 2012. In July 2014, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock (the "IPO"), which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the symbol "CTLT." Blackstone, Genstar Capital and Aisling Capital (collectively, the "selling stockholders") have completed several secondary offerings of their Catalent common stock in the past three fiscal years. In September 2016, the selling stockholders completed a final secondary offering of their remaining shares in the Company and are no longer shareholders. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
Leading Provider of Advanced Delivery Technologies and Development Solutions 
We are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs, biologics and consumer and animal health products. In the last decade, we have earned revenue with respect to nearly half of the drugs based on new molecular entities ("NMEs") approved by the FDA, and over the past three years with respect to nearly 80% of the top 200 largest-selling compounds globally. With approximately 1,600 scientists and technicians worldwide and approximately 1,100 patents and patent applications, our expertise is in providing differentiated technologies and solutions that help our customers bring more products and better treatments to market faster. For example, in the high-value area of new chemical entities ("NCEs") , nearly 90% of NCE softgel approvals by the FDA over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us. 
Diversified Operating Platform 
We are diversified by virtue of our geographic scope, our large customer base, the extensive range of products we produce, our broad service offerings, and our ability to provide solutions at nearly every stage of a product’s lifecycle. In fiscal 2017, we produced nearly 7,000 distinct items across multiple categories; our fiscal 2017 regulatory-based classification of revenues demonstrates this: branded drugs (40%), generic prescription drugs (11%), biologics (14%), over-the-counter (14%), and consumer health, veterinary products, medical devices and diagnostics (21% combined). In fiscal 2017, our top 20 products represented approximately 24% of total revenue, with no single customer accounting for greater than 10% of revenue and with no individual product greater than 3%. We serve more than 1,000 customers in approximately 80 countries, with a majority of our fiscal 2017 revenues coming from outside the United States. This diversity, combined with long product lifecycles and close customer relationships, has contributed to the stability of our business. It has also allowed us to reduce our exposure to potential strategic, customer and product shifts as well as to payer-driven pricing pressures experienced by our branded drug and biologic customers.

Longstanding, Extensive Relationships with Blue Chip Customers 
We have longstanding, extensive relationships with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. In fiscal 2017, we did business with 85 of the top 100 branded drug marketers, 23 of the top 25 generics marketers, 23 of the top 25 biologics marketers, and 22 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally, as well as with more than 1,000 other customers, including emerging and specialty companies, which are often more reliant on outside partners as a result of their more virtual business models. Regardless of size, our customers seek innovative product development, superior quality, advanced manufacturing and skilled technical services to support their development and marketed product needs.
We believe our customers value us because our depth of development solutions and advanced delivery technologies, consistent and reliable supply, geographic reach and substantial expertise enable us to create a broad range of tailored solutions, many of which are unavailable from other individual providers. 
Deep, Broad and Growing Technology Foundation 
Our breadth of proprietary and patented technologies and long track record of innovation substantially differentiate us from other industry participants. Our leading softgel platforms, including Liqui-Gels, OptiShell and Vegicaps capsules, and our modified release technologies, including the Zydis family, OptiPact and OptiMelt technologies, provide formulation expertise to solve complex delivery challenges for our customers. We offer advanced technologies for delivery of small molecules and biologics via respiratory, ophthalmic and injectable routes, including the blow-fill-seal unit dose technology, ADVASEPT glass-free vials, and prefilled syringes. We also provide advanced biologics formulation options, including Gene Product Expression ("GPEx") cell-line and SMARTag antibody-drug conjugate technologies. We have a market leadership position within respiratory delivery, including metered dose and dry powder inhalers, and intra-nasal forms. We have reinforced our leadership position in advanced delivery technologies over the last five years, as we have launched more than a dozen new technology platforms and applications, including the fiscal 2016 launch of our OptiForm Solution Suite, a dose form-agnostic bioavailability enhancement program for early-stage molecules. Our culture of creativity and innovation is grounded in our advanced delivery technologies, our scientists and engineers, and our patents and proprietary manufacturing processes throughout our global network. Our global product development team drives a focused application of resources to our highest priority opportunities for both new customer product introductions and platform technology development. As of June 30, 2017, we had nearly 800 product development programs in active development across our businesses. 
Long-Duration Relationships Provide Sustainability 
Our broad and diverse range of technologies closely integrates with our customers’ molecules to yield final dose forms, and this generally results in the inclusion of Catalent in our customers’ prescription product regulatory filings. Both of these factors translate to long-duration supply relationships at an individual product level, to which we apply our expertise in contracting to produce long-duration commercial supply agreements. These agreements typically have initial terms of three to ten years with regular renewals of one to three years (see "Contractual Arrangements" for more detail). Nearly two-thirds of our fiscal 2017 advanced delivery technology platform revenues (comprised of our Softgel Technologies and Drug Delivery Solutions reporting segments) were covered by such long-term contractual arrangements. We believe this base provides us with a sustainable competitive advantage. 
Significant Recent Growth Investments 
We have made significant investments over time to establish a global manufacturing network, and today employ 5.3 million square feet of manufacturing and laboratory space across five continents. We have invested approximately $665 million in the last five fiscal years in gross capital expenditures. Growth-related investments in facilities, capacity and capabilities across our businesses have positioned us for future growth in areas aligned with anticipated future demand. Through our focus on operational, quality and regulatory excellence, we drive ongoing and continuous improvements in safety, productivity and reliable supply to customer expectations, which we believe further differentiate us. Our manufacturing network and capabilities allow us the flexibility to reliably supply the changing needs of our customers while consistently meeting their quality, delivery and regulatory compliance expectations. 
High Standards of Regulatory Compliance and Operational and Quality Excellence 
We operate our plants in accordance with current good manufacturing practices ("cGMP") or other applicable requirements, following our own high standards that are consistent with those of many of our large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. We have nearly 1,400 employees around the globe focused on quality and regulatory compliance. More than half of our facilities are registered with the FDA, with the remaining facilities registered with other applicable regulatory agencies, such as the European Medicines Agency (the "EMA"). In some cases, facilities are registered with multiple 
8


regulatory agencies. In fiscal 2017, we were subject to 53 regulatory audits and, over the last five fiscal years, we successfully completed more than 250 regulatory audits. We also undergo more than 400 customer and internal audits annually. We believe our quality and regulatory track record to be a competitive differentiator for Catalent. 
Strong and Experienced Management Team 
Our executive leadership team collectively has more than 200 years of combined and diverse experience within the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. With an average of more than 20 years of functional experience, this team possesses deep knowledge and a wide network of industry relationships. 
Our Strategy 
We are pursuing the following key growth initiatives: 
"Follow the Molecule®" Providing Solutions to our Customers across all Phases of the Product Lifecycle 
We intend to use our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions across the entire lifecycle of our customers’ products to drive future growth. Our development solutions span the drug development process, starting with our platforms for early pre-clinical development of small molecules, biologics and antibody-drug conjugates, to formulation and analytical services, through clinical development and manufacturing of clinical trial supplies, to regulatory consulting. Once a molecule is ready for therapeutic trials and subsequent commercialization, we provide our customers with a range of advanced delivery technologies and manufacturing expertise that allow them to deliver their molecules to the end-users in appropriate dosage forms. The relationship between a molecule and our advanced delivery technologies typically starts with developing and manufacturing the innovator product, then extends throughout the molecule’s commercial life, including with additional customers through potential generic launches or over-the-counter conversion. For prescription products, we are typically the sole and/or exclusive provider, and are reflected in customers’ new drug applications. Our revenues from our advanced delivery technologies are primarily driven by volumes and, as a result, the loss of an innovator drug's market exclusivity may be mitigated if we supply both branded and generic customers. 
An example of this can be found in a leading over-the-counter respiratory brand, which today uses both our Zydis fast dissolve and our Liqui-Gels softgel technologies. We originally began development of the prescription format of this product for our multinational pharmaceutical company partner in 1992 to address specific patient sub-segment needs. After four years of development, we then commercially supplied the prescription Zydis product for six years, and we have continued to provide the Zydis form since the switch to over-the-counter status in the United States and other markets in the early 2000s. More recently, we proactively brought a softgel product concept for the brand to the customer, which the customer elected to develop and launch as well. By following this molecule, we have built a strong, 25-year long relationship across multiple formats and markets. 
Customer Product Pipeline - Continuing to Grow Through New Projects and Product Launches 
We intend to grow by supplementing our existing diverse base of commercialized advanced delivery technology products with new development programs. As of June 30, 2017, our product development teams were working on nearly 800 new customer programs. Our base of active development programs has expanded in recent years from growing market demand, as well as from our expanded capabilities and technologies. Although there are many complex factors that affect the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical, biological and customer and animal health products, we expect that a portion of these programs will reach full development and market approval in the future and thereby add to our long-duration commercial revenues under long-term contracts and grow our existing product base. In the year ended June 30, 2017, we introduced 183 new products, consistent with the prior year level. 
Catalent continues to be the global leader in providing chemistry, manufacturing and controls-based product development services to the global pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health industry, driven by thousands of projects annually. In the year ended June 30, 2017, we recognized approximately $409 million of revenue related to the development of products on behalf of customers, included in our Softgel Technologies and Drug Delivery Solutions reporting segments, up 24% from the prior year. In addition, substantially all of the revenues associated with the Clinical Supply Services segment relate to our support of customer products in development.

Capabilities & Capacity - Expanding In Biologics and Other Attractive Markets 
Recognizing the strategic importance of biologics, we began to build a differentiated biologics cell-line and formulation development platform in 2002. Since then, the Company has invested more than $150 million to create our Catalent Biologics offering (included in our Drug Delivery Solutions segment). Today, Catalent is a recognized leader in advanced cell-line development and formulation, and increasingly in specialized manufacturing of biologic drug substance for use in clinical trials and bioanalytical analysis. During fiscal 2017, the second production suite in our Madison, Wisconsin facility came on-line, and we broke ground for the third suite, which will take us to commercial scale supply. We have partnered with customers from around the world to develop advanced cell expression for more than 600 products, many using our advanced GPEx technology. We have invested in a second-generation antibody-drug conjugate technology, SMARTag, and in fiscal 2017, we licensed rights to a development stage ADC product we created and saw continued progress in our customers’ SMARTag product development activities. We expect to continue to expand our biologics presence through both organic and potential inorganic investments.
In addition to biologics, we have increased our existing investments in several facilities in order to expand in attractive markets, including a recently completed significant expansion of our oral solid controlled release production capacity in Kentucky and the scaling-up of commercial manufacturing capacity for metered-dose inhalers. We have also inorganically added key new capabilities in early development via our fiscal 2017 acquisition of Pharmatek, and expanded our North American consumer health softgel capacity via our Accucaps acquisition. 
Advanced Technologies - Capitalize on Our Substantial Platforms 
We have broad and diverse technology platform that are supported by extensive know-how and approximately 1,100 patents and patent applications in approximately 100 families across advanced delivery technologies, drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing. For example, we have significant softgel fill and formulation know-how, databases and substantial softgel regulatory approval expertise, and, as a result, nearly 90% of NCE softgel approvals by the FDA over the last 25 years have been developed and supplied by us. 
In addition to resolving product challenges for our customers’ molecules, for more than two decades we have applied our technology platforms and development expertise to proactively develop proof-of-concept products, whether improved versions of existing drugs, new generic formulations or innovative consumer health products. In the consumer health area, we file product dossiers with regulators in relevant jurisdictions for self-created products, which help contribute sustainable growth to our consumer health business. We expect to continue to seek proactive development opportunities and other non-traditional relationships to increase demand for and value realized from our technology platforms. These activities have provided us with opportunities to capture an increased share of end-market value through out-licensing, profit-sharing and other arrangements. 
Operational Leverage - Deploy Existing Infrastructure and Operational Discipline to Drive Profitable Growth 
Through our existing infrastructure, including our global network of operating locations and programs, we promote operational discipline and drive margin expansion. With our Lean Manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma programs, a global procurement function and conversion cost productivity metrics in place, we have created a culture of functional excellence and cost accountability. We intend to continue to apply this discipline to further leverage our operational network for profitable growth. Since fiscal 2009, we have expanded gross margin by over 400 basis points and Adjusted EBITDA margin by over 200 basis points. Note that that "Adjusted EBITDA" is a financial metric that is not prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), and that further explanations of this metric and comparisons to the most nearly comparable U.S. GAAP metrics are set forth below at "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Historical and Adjusted EBITDA."
Strategic Acquisitions and Licensing - Build on our Existing Platform 
We operate in highly fragmented markets in both our advanced delivery technologies and development solutions businesses. Within those markets, the five top players represent nearly 35% and 10% of the total market share, respectively, by revenue. Our broad platform, global infrastructure and diversified customer base provide us with a strong foundation from which to consolidate within these markets and to generate operating leverage through such acquisitions. Since fiscal 2012, we have executed eleven transactions, investing approximately $900 million, and have demonstrated an ability to efficiently and effectively integrate these acquisitions. 
While we are rigorously focused on driving Catalent's organic growth, we intend to continue to opportunistically source and execute bolt-on strategic acquisitions within our existing business areas, as well as to undertake transactions that provide us with expansion opportunities within new geographic markets or adjacent market segments. We have a dedicated corporate 
10


development team in place to identify these opportunities and have a rigorous and financially disciplined process for evaluating, executing and integrating such acquisitions.

This table should be read in conjunction with Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Consolidated Financial Statements"). 
Softgel Technologies 
Through our Softgel Technologies segment, we provide formulation, development and manufacturing services for soft capsules, or "softgels," which we first commercialized in the 1930s and have continually enhanced. We are the market leader in overall softgel manufacturing, and hold the leading market position in the prescription arena. Our principal softgel technologies include traditional softgel capsules, in which the shell is made of animal-derived gelatin, and Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules, in which the shell is made from plant-derived materials. Softgel capsules are used in a broad range of customer products, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements and unit-dose cosmetics. Softgel capsules encapsulate liquid, paste or oil-based active compounds in solution or suspension within an outer shell, filling and sealing the capsule simultaneously. We typically perform all encapsulation for a product within one of our softgel facilities, with active ingredients provided by customers or sourced directly by us. Softgels have historically been used to solve formulation challenges or technical issues for a specific drug, to help improve the clinical performance of compounds, to provide important market differentiation, particularly for over-the-counter compounds, and to provide safe handling of hormonal, potent and cytotoxic drugs. We also participate in the softgel vitamin, mineral and supplement business in selected regions around the world. With the 2001 introduction of our plant-derived softgel shell, Vegicaps capsules, consumer health manufacturers have been able to extend the softgel dose form to a broader range of active ingredients and serve patient/consumer populations that were previously inaccessible due to religious, dietary or cultural preferences. In recent years, we have extended this platform to pharmaceutical products via our OptiShell offering. Our Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules are protected by patents in most major global markets. Physician and patient studies we have conducted have demonstrated a preference for softgels versus traditional tablet and hard capsule dose forms in terms of ease of swallowing, real or perceived speed of delivery, ability to remove or eliminate unpleasant odor or taste and, for physicians, perceived improved patient adherence with dosing regimens. Representative customers of Softgel Technologies include Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Teva, Johnson & Johnson and Allergan.
Our Softgel Technologies segment represents 40%, 41%, and 42% of the segments' aggregate revenue before inter-segment eliminations for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Drug Delivery Solutions 
Our Drug Delivery Solutions segment provides various complex advanced formulation delivery technologies, and related integrated solutions including: development and manufacturing of a broad range of oral dose forms including fast-dissolve tablets and both proprietary and conventional controlled release products, and delivery of pharmaceuticals, biologics and biosimilars administered via injection, inhalation and ophthalmic routes, using both traditional and advanced technologies. Representative customers of Drug Delivery Solutions include Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Roche, Teva, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson and Allergan. 
We provide comprehensive pre-formulation, development, and both clinical and commercial scale for most traditional and advanced oral solid dose formats, including uncoated and coated tablets, powder/pellet/bead-filled two-piece hard capsules, lozenges, powders and other forms for immediate and modified release prescription, consumer and animal health products. We have substantial experience developing and scaling up products requiring accelerated development timelines, specialized handling, complex technology transfers, or specialized manufacturing processes.
 We launched our orally dissolving tablet business in 1986 with the introduction of Zydis tablets, a unique oral dosage form that is freeze-dried in its package, can be swallowed without water, and typically dissolves in the mouth in less than three seconds. Most often used for indications, drugs and patient groups that can benefit from rapid oral disintegration, the Zydis technology is utilized in a wide range of products and indications, including treatments for a variety of central nervous system-related conditions such as migraines, Parkinson’s Disease, schizophrenia, and pain relief and consumer healthcare products targeting allergy relief. Zydis tablets continue to be used in new ways by our customers as we extend the application of the technology to new categories, such as for immunotherapies, vaccines and biologics delivery. 
Our range of injectable manufacturing offerings includes filling drugs or biologics into pre-filled syringes and glass-free ADVASEPT vials, with flexibility to accommodate other formats within our existing network, increasingly focused on complex pharmaceuticals and biologics. With our range of technologies we are able to meet a wide range of specifications, timelines and budgets. We believe that the complexity of the manufacturing process, the importance of experience and know-how, regulatory compliance, and high start-up capital requirements provide us with a substantial competitive advantage in the market. For example, blow-fill-seal is an advanced aseptic processing technology, which uses a continuous process to form, fill with drug, and seal a plastic container in a sterile environment. Blow-fill-seal units are currently used for a variety of pharmaceuticals in liquid form, such as respiratory, ophthalmic and otic products. We are a leader in the outsourced blow-fill-seal market, and operate one of the largest capacity commercial manufacturing blow-fill-seal facilities in the world. Our sterile blow-fill-seal manufacturing has significant capacity and flexibility with regard to manufacturing configurations. This business provides flexible and scalable solutions for unit-dose delivery of complex formulations such as suspensions and emulsions. Further, the business provides engineering and manufacturing solutions related to complex containers. Our regulatory expertise can lead to decreased time to commercialization, and our dedicated development production lines support feasibility, stability and clinical runs. We plan to continue to expand our product line in existing and new markets, and in higher margin specialty products with additional respiratory, ophthalmic, injectable and nasal applications. 
Our fast-growing biologics offerings include our formulation development and cell-line manufacturing based on our advanced and patented GPEx technology, which is used to develop stable, high-yielding mammalian cell lines for both innovator and biosimilar biologic compounds. Our GPEx technology can provide rapid cell-line development, high biologics production yields, flexibility and versatility. We believe our development-stage SMARTag next-generation antibody-drug conjugate technology will provide more precision targeting for delivery of drugs to tumors or other locations, with improved safety versus existing technologies. Our biologics facility in Madison, Wisconsin has the current capability and capacity to produce clinical-scale biologic supplies, with a commercial-capable suite under construction; combined with offerings from our other businesses and external partners, we provide the broadest range of technologies and services supporting the development and launch of new biologic entities, biosimilars or biobetters to bring a product from gene to market commercialization, faster. 
We also offer analytical chemical and cell-based testing and scientific services, stability testing, respiratory products formulation and manufacturing, micronization and particle engineering services, regulatory consulting, and bioanalytical testing for biologic products. Our respiratory product capabilities include development and manufacturing services for inhaled products for delivery via metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers and intra-nasal sprays. We also provide formulation development and clinical and commercial manufacturing for conventional and specialty oral dose forms. We provide global regulatory and clinical support services for our customers’ regulatory and clinical strategies during all stages of development. Demand for our offerings is driven by the need for scientific expertise and depth and breadth of services offered, as well as by the reliable supply thereof, including quality, execution and performance.

In fiscal 2017, we did business with 85 of the top 100 branded drug marketers, 23 of the top 25 generics marketers, 23 of the top 25 biologics marketers, and 22 of the top 25 consumer health marketers globally, as well as with more than 1,000 other customers. Faced with access, pricing and reimbursement pressures as well as other market challenges, large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have increasingly sought partners to enhance the clinical competitiveness of their drugs and biologics and improve the productivity of their research and development activities, while reducing their fixed cost base. Many mid-size, emerging and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, while facing the same pricing and market pressures, have chosen not to build a full infrastructure, but rather to partner with other companies through licensing agreements or outsourcing to access the critical skills, technologies and services required to bring their products to market. Consumer health companies require rapidly developed, innovative dose forms and formulations to keep up in the fast-paced over-the-counter medication and vitamins markets. These market segments are all critically important to our growth, but require distinct solutions, marketing and sales approaches, and market strategy. 
We follow a hybrid demand generation organization model, with strategic account teams offering the full breadth of Catalent’s solutions, and technical specialist teams providing the in-depth technical knowledge and practical experience essential for each individual offering. All business development and field sales representatives ultimately report to a single sales head, and significant ongoing investments are made to enhance their skills and capabilities. Our sales organization currently consists of more than 150 full-time, experienced sales professionals, supported by inside sales and sales operations. We also have built a dedicated strategic marketing team, providing strategic market and product planning and management for our offerings. As part of our marketing efforts, we participate in major trade shows relevant to the offerings globally and ensure adequate visibility to our offerings and solutions through a comprehensive print and on-line advertising and publicity program. We believe that Catalent is a strong brand with high overall awareness in our established markets and target customers, and that our brand identity has become a competitive advantage for us.

Global Accounts 
We manage selected accounts globally due to their substantial current business and growth potential. We recorded approximately 26% of our total revenue in fiscal 2017 from these global accounts. Each global account is assigned a lead business development professional with substantial industry experience. These account leaders, along with other members of the sales and executive leadership teams, are responsible for managing and extending the overall account relationship. Account leaders work closely with the rest of the sales organization to ensure alignment around critical priorities for the accounts. 
Emerging, Specialty and Virtual Accounts 
Emerging, specialty and virtual pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to be critical drivers of industry growth globally. Historically, many of these companies have chosen not to build a full infrastructure, but rather partner with other companies to produce their products. We expect them to continue to do so in the future, providing a critical source for future integrated solutions demand. We expect to continue to increase our penetration of geographic clusters of emerging companies in North America, Europe, South America and Asia. We regularly use active pipeline and product screening and customer targeting to identify the optimal candidates for partnering based on product profiles, funding status, and relationships, to ensure that our technical sales specialists and field sales representatives develop custom solutions designed to address the specific needs of customers in the market. 
Contractual Arrangements 
We generally enter into a broad range of contractual arrangements with our customers, including agreements with respect to feasibility, development, supply, licenses, and quality. The terms of these contracts vary significantly depending on the offering and customer requirements. Some of our agreements may include a variety of revenue arrangements such as fee-for-service, minimum volume commitments, royalties, profit-sharing and fixed fees. We employ a range of capacity access approaches, from standard to completely dedicated capacity models, based on customer and product needs. We generally secure pricing and contract mechanisms in our supply agreements that allow for periodic resetting of pricing terms, and, in some cases, these agreements provide for our ability to renegotiate pricing in the event of certain price increases for the raw materials utilized in the products we make. Our typical supply agreements include indemnification from our customers for product liability and intellectual property matters and caps on our contractual liabilities, subject in each case to negotiated exclusions. In addition, our manufacturing supply agreement terms range from three to ten years with regular renewals of one to three years, although some of our agreements are terminable upon much shorter notice periods, such as 30 or 90 days. For our development solutions offerings, we may enter into master service agreements, which provide for standardized terms and conditions and make it easier and faster for customers with multiple development needs to access our offerings. 
Backlog 
While we generally have long-term supply agreements that provide for a revenue stream over a period of years, our backlog represents, as of a point in time, future service revenues from work not yet completed. For our Softgel and Drug Delivery Solutions segments, backlog represents firm orders for manufacturing services and includes minimum volumes, where applicable. For our Clinical Supply Services segment, backlog represents estimated future service revenues from work not yet completed under signed contracts. Using these methods of reporting backlog, as of June 30, 2017, our backlog was approximately $1,052.2 million, as compared to approximately $827.5 million as of June 30, 2016, including approximately $338.3 million and $292.1 million, respectively, related to our Clinical Supply Services segment. We expect to recognize approximately 83% of revenue from the backlog in existence as of June 30, 2017 by the completion of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.
To the extent projects are delayed, the timing of our revenue could be affected. If a customer cancels an order, we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred. For orders that are placed inside a contractual firm period, we generally have a contractual right to payment in the event of cancellation. Fluctuations in our reported backlog levels also result from the timing and order pattern of our customers who often seek to manage their level of inventory on hand. Because of customer ordering patterns, our backlog reported for certain periods may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future results. 
Manufacturing Capabilities 
We operate manufacturing facilities, development centers and sales offices throughout the world. We have thirty-five facilities (three locations each operate as two facilities for different reporting segments) on five continents with 5.3 million square feet of manufacturing, lab and related space. Our manufacturing capabilities include the full suite of competencies relevant to support each site’s activities, including regulatory, quality assurance and in-house validation. 
14


We operate our plants in accordance with cGMP or other applicable requirements. More than half of our facilities are registered with the FDA, with the remaining facilities being registered with other applicable regulatory agencies, such as the EMA. In some cases, our facilities are registered with multiple regulatory agencies. 
We have invested approximately $420.4 million of cash outflows in our manufacturing facilities since fiscal 2015 through improvements and expansions in our facilities, including approximately $139.8 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2017. We believe that our facilities and equipment are in good condition, are well maintained and are able to operate at or above present levels for the foreseeable future, in all material respects. 
Our manufacturing operations are focused on employee health and safety, regulatory compliance, operational excellence, continuous improvement, and process standardization across the organization. In fiscal 2017, we achieved approximately 98% on-time shipment delivery versus customer request date across our network as a result of this focus. Our manufacturing operations are structured around an enterprise management philosophy and methodology that utilizes principles and tools common to a number of quality management programs, including Lean Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing. 
Raw Materials 
We use a broad and diverse range of raw materials in the design, development and manufacture of our products. This includes, but is not limited to, key materials such as gelatin, starch, and iota carrageenan for our Softgel Technologies segment; packaging films for our Clinical Supply Services segment, and resin for our blow-fill-seal business in our Drug Delivery Solutions segment. The raw materials that we use are sourced externally on a global basis. Globally, our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural disasters and international supply disruptions, including those caused by pandemics, geopolitical and other issues. For example, commercially usable gelatin is available from a limited number of sources. In addition, much of the gelatin we use is bovine-derived. Past concerns of contamination from Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ("BSE") have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin. If there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers, there can be no assurance that we could obtain an alternative supply from our other suppliers. If future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovine-derived gelatin from certain geographic sources due to concerns of contamination from BSE, any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative non-bovine-derived gelatin for specific customer products could be subject to lengthy formulation, testing and regulatory approval periods. 
We work very closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining excellence in material quality and reliability, and we have an active and effective supplier audit program. We continually evaluate alternate sources of supply, although we do not frequently pursue regulatory qualification of alternative sources for key raw materials due to the strength of our existing supplier relationships, the reliability of our current supplier base and the time and expense associated with the regulatory process. Although a change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment by us in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to the performance of our products or incorporate specialized material such as gelatin, we do not believe that the loss of any existing supply arrangement would have a material adverse effect on our business. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs, availability, and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, purchased components, and raw materials."
Competition 
We compete on several fronts both domestically and internationally, including with other companies that offer advanced delivery technologies, outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing, or development services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health companies based in North America, South America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. We also may compete with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health manufacturers that choose to source these services internally, where possible. 

Competition is driven by proprietary technologies and know-how (where relevant), consistency of operational performance, quality, price, value and speed. While we do have competitors that compete with us in our individual offerings, we do not believe we have competition from any directly comparable companies.

Research and Development Costs
Our research activities are primarily directed toward the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements. Costs incurred in connection with the development of new offerings and manufacturing process improvements are recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses. Such research and development costs included in selling, general, and administrative expenses amounted to $7.0 million, $7.6 million and $12.2 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. Costs incurred in connection with research and development services we provide to customers and services performed in support of the commercial manufacturing process for customers are recorded within cost of sales. Such research and development costs included in cost of sales amounted to $45.8 million, $47.4 million and $41.3 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017, June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively.
Employees 
As of June 30, 2017, we had approximately 10,800 employees in thirty-five facilities on five continents: twelve facilities are in the United States, with certain employees at one facility being represented by a labor organization with their terms and conditions of employment being subject to a collective bargaining agreement. National works councils and/or labor organizations are active at all eleven of our European facilities consistent with labor environments/laws in European countries. Similar relationships with labor organizations or national works councils exist at our plants in Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and Australia. Our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory. 

 | North America | Europe | South America | Asia Pacific | Total 
Approximate Number of Employees as of June 30, 2017 | 5,200 | 3,900 | 900 | 800 | 10,800

Corporate Responsibility
A sense of responsibility to our employees, customers and suppliers and the communities in which we operate and a desire to work to sustain the environments and resources affected by our activities are integrated into the heart of our business, as we fulfill our purpose to help people live better, healthier lives.  We take our corporate responsibilities seriously. We believe that we succeed as an organization when we put the needs of the patients and other individuals who consume our drugs and other products first, and we are committed to act with integrity in everything we do. Our employees are supporting Catalent’s corporate responsibility commitment and helping millions of people around the world live better, healthier lives by developing, delivering and supplying reliable, high-quality treatments; connecting to and bettering our communities; promoting a healthy environment and investing in our people to help them and our business grow.
Our Corporate Responsibility Council (the "CR Council") is made up of executive and senior leadership and guides the implementation of our corporate responsibility strategy and commitments. Three sub-committees - the Environmental Committee, the Grant-making Committee and the Community Engagement Ambassador Network - of the CR Council are responsible for driving progress in three key areas of our overall corporate responsibility commitment. They help to embed corporate responsibility deeper into the business and align the corporate responsibility agenda with our business goals.
We are expanding our strategic grant-making activities to focus on partnerships, initiatives and programs that demonstrably promote research and development into or delivery or use of a treatment or encourage STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education initiatives. We intend to introduce matching-gift and volunteer grant programs for our employees while coordinating even more volunteer projects in the communities around the world in which we operate.
Intellectual Property 
We rely on a combination of know-how, trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings, services and intangible assets. These proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations. Certain of our operations and products are under intellectual property licenses from third parties, and in certain instances we license our technology to third parties. We also have a long track record of innovation across our lines of business, and, to further encourage active innovation, we have developed incentive compensation systems linked to patent filings and other recognition and reward programs for scientists and non-scientists alike. 
16


We have applied in the United States and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks, service marks and patents, some of which have been registered and issued, and also hold common law rights in various trademarks and service marks. We hold approximately 1,100 patents and patent applications worldwide in advanced drug delivery and biologics formulations and technologies, and manufacturing and other areas. 
We hold patents and license rights relating to certain aspects of our formulations, nutritional and pharmaceutical dosage forms, mammalian cell engineering, and sterile manufacturing services. We also hold patents relating to certain processes and products. We have a number of pending patent applications in the United States and certain foreign countries, and intend to pursue additional patents as appropriate. We have enforced and will continue to enforce our intellectual property rights in the United States and worldwide. 
We do not consider any particular patent, trademark, license, franchise, or concession to be material to our overall business. 
Regulatory Matters 
The manufacture, distribution and marketing of healthcare products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, other United States ("U.S.") governmental authorities and foreign regulatory authorities. Certain of our subsidiaries are required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and must comply with the operating, cGMP, quality and security standards of, applicable domestic and foreign healthcare regulators, including the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Agency (the "DEA"), the Department of Health and Human Services (the "DHHS"), the equivalent agencies of European Union (the "EU") member states and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and comparable foreign agencies, as well as various accrediting bodies, each depending upon the type of operations and the locations of distribution and sale of the products manufactured or services provided by those subsidiaries. 
In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to other healthcare laws, including the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, the Controlled Substances Act and comparable state and foreign laws and regulations in certain of their activities.
We are also subject to various federal, state, local, foreign and transnational laws, regulations and recommendations, both in the United States and abroad, relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and distribution practices and the use, transportation and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. In addition, U.S. and international import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the cross-border transit of finished goods, raw materials and supplies and the handling of information. We are also subject to various other laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records. 
The costs associated with complying with the various applicable federal, state, local, foreign and transnational regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition," for additional discussion of the costs associated with complying with the various regulations. 
In fiscal 2017, we were subject to 53 regulatory audits and, over the last five fiscal years, we successfully completed more than 250 regulatory audits, with approximately 50% resulting in no reported observations. 
Quality Assurance 
We are committed to ensuring and maintaining the highest standard of regulatory compliance while providing high quality products to our customers. To meet these commitments, we have developed and implemented a Catalent-wide quality management system throughout the organization. We have nearly 1,400 employees around the globe focusing on quality and regulatory compliance. Our senior management team is actively involved in setting quality policies, standards and internal position papers as well as managing internal and external quality performance. Our quality assurance department provides quality leadership and supervises our quality systems programs. An internal audit program monitors compliance with applicable regulations, standards and internal policies. In addition, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, the DEA and other equivalent local, state and foreign regulatory authorities and customers. All FDA, DEA and other regulatory inspectional observations have been resolved or are on track to be completed at the prescribed timeframe provided in commitments to the applicable agency in all material respects. We believe that our operations are in compliance in all material respects with the regulations under which our facilities are governed. 
17


Environmental Matters 
Our operations are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") and equivalent state, local and foreign regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. Our manufacturing facilities use, in varying degrees, hazardous substances in their processes. These substances include, among others, chlorinated solvents, and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities, including a number we no longer own or operate. As at our current facilities, contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us, for which we have recorded appropriate reserves as needed. We believe that our operations are in compliance in all material respects with the environment, health and safety regulations applicable to our facilities.
