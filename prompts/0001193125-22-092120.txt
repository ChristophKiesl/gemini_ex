Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 We are a pharmaceutical company focused on the commercialization of JATENZO, the first and only oral T-replacement, or T-replacement therapy (“TRT”) of its kind that has received final approval by the FDA. We believe that current users of TRT are not satisfied with their current options and desire a therapeutic that is safe, effective and more convenient. Our primary goal for JATENZO is for it to become the preferred choice for TRT among men with hypogonadism — T deficiency accompanied by an associated medical condition. In parallel, our broader vision is to become a pharmaceutical company initially focused on the development and commercialization of JATENZO and other metabolic therapies for men and women. 
 In March 2019, our first commercial product, JATENZO, was approved by the FDA as a TRT for the treatment of adult men with hypogonadism due to certain medical conditions. JATENZO is the first oral T therapy approved by the FDA in more than 60 years. JATENZO is a T-ester prodrug created by the linkage of T with the fatty acid undecanoic acid to form T-undecanoate (“TU”). Once absorbed, TU, an inactive version of T, is converted by natural enzymes in the body to bioactive T. In February 2020, we commenced U.S. commercial sales of JATENZO and, as of December 31, 2021, JATENZO was available under health plans, representing approximately 70% all insured lives. Of these patients, 77% of patients with commercial insurance had access to JATENZO. In the year ended December 31, 2021, JATENZO generated net revenues of approximately $14.0 million, demonstrating consistent month over month prescription growth since beginning commercialization despite the commercial challenges presented by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2019, the FDA granted 3-year Hatch-Waxman market exclusivity to JATENZO, which prevents the FDA from granting full market approval to similar new drugs or generic competitors for the protected conditions of use of JATENZO until March 27, 2022. 
Initial Business Combination 
 We were a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on May 22, 2020 and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On September 9, 2021, (the “Closing Date”), we consummated the previously announced business combination pursuant to the terms of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 27, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among our company, our wholly-owned merger subsidiary, and Clarus Therapeutics, Inc. (“Legacy Clarus”), in which our merger subsidiary merged with and into Legacy Clarus, with Legacy Clarus surviving as the post-merger company and as a wholly owned subsidiary of our company. On the Closing Date, we changed our name from Blue Water Acquisition Corp. to Clarus Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. At the effective time of the merger (the “Effective Time”), we issued an aggregate of 17,886,348 shares of our common stock to the Legacy Clarus security holders, assumed some Legacy Clarus warrants that are now exercisable for 9,246 shares of our common stock, and the remaining shares of Legacy Clarus capital stock and all outstanding options, warrants or rights to purchase or subscribe for any Legacy Clarus capital stock, securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or that otherwise conferred on the holder any right to acquire any capital stock of Legacy Clarus were cancelled, retired and terminated without any consideration or any liability to Legacy Clarus with respect thereto. In addition, all shares of our Class B common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, were converted into Class A common stock and then redesignated as common stock. 
Capital Raising and Restructuring Plan 
 In light of our current liquidity, we need to raise additional capital to support our operations and debt obligations and concurrently, we are exploring strategic alternatives for the purpose of maximizing stockholder value. We have been and expect to continue to devote significant efforts to raise capital, restructure our indebtedness and identify and evaluate potential strategic alternatives but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, that we will be able to raise necessary capital on acceptable terms, reach agreement with our lenders, or that the strategic review process will result in us pursuing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms or at all. Our board of directors has not approved a definitive course of action. Additionally, there can be no assurances that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated or lead to increased stockholder value or that we will make any additional cash distributions to our stockholders. Any failure in these efforts could force us to delay, limit or terminate our operations, make reductions in our workforce, discontinue our commercialization efforts for JATENZO as well as other development programs, liquidate all or a portion of our assets or pursue other strategic alternatives, fall into forbearance on our debt obligations, and/or seek protection under the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
 TRT Overview 
 T-deficiency is diagnosed in men by a simple blood test that identifies a T concentration below 300 nanograms per deciliter (“ng/dL”). Common symptoms identified in the Endocrine Society’s clinical guidelines that suggest testing for T deficiency include reduced sexual activity and desire, decreased energy, increased body fat and reduced muscle mass, depressed mood and other emotional and physiological issues. T-deficiency affects approximately 20 million men over the age of 45, according to a study published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice in 2006. Of this population, about 8 million are diagnosed with hypogonadism, and even fewer, approximately 2.2 
 
1 
 
  million, actually receive TRT, the standard treatment for hypogonadism. Even with this low treatment rate, the overall market for TRT grew 7% in 2020 over 2019, despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which followed a 6.6% growth in prescriptions in the United States in 2019 as compared to 2018. The overall T-replacement therapy market was nearly 8 million prescriptions in 2020 and has been growing at a 5% compound annual growth rate, according to Symphony Health (Payer/Plan TRx Volume). 
 Existing therapeutic options for hypogonadal men, including T-injections (intramuscular and subcutaneous), T-gels, T-patches, T- buccal T-patches and implanted subcutaneous T-pellets, all suffer from limitations due to their routes of administration and ease of use. Consequently, these TRT options have low rates of adherence to prescribed dosing regimens. For example, only 31% and 14% of men continued taking T-gel six and 12 months after commencing therapy, respectively, according to a peer-reviewed study that reviewed enrollment and medical records of more than 15,000 men with hypogonadism. In addition, according to a survey we commissioned in 2020, 76% of the surveyed men reported that their needs are not being met by existing T-replacement therapies. This same poll found that 82% of TRT users were interested in learning about an oral TRT option. We believe that many hypogonadal patients are not satisfied with non-oral therapies due to administration and other challenges. Thus, they often discontinue their TRT or switch from one option to another in a cyclical search of a TRT that is acceptable. We believe JATENZO not only provides patients with the convenience of an oral route of administration but also the efficacy and safety necessary to treat hypogonadism. Although T-injections and T-gels collectively represent 95% of the TRT market, these products have significant challenges. Injections are painful, yield considerable inter-day T level variability and carry the risk of pulmonary micro-embolisms (“POMEs”). Gels are messy, pose a significant risk of T transference to the patient’s partner or children and result in substantial amounts of T entering the environment when patients shower, bathe or swim. Overall, we believe that JATENZO is more convenient than currently approved T therapies, thus making it more likely that men will adhere to their treatment. 
 We own patents and pending applications in the United States and several other countries worldwide having claims covering the formulation and use of JATENZO, and have been involved in a U.S. district court patent infringement action, and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) interference proceedings with Lipocine, Inc. (“Lipocine”) involving Lipocine patents and Clarus patent application having claims covering the use of JATENZO and/or Lipocine’s TLANDO product. See Item 3 “Legal Proceedings”. We have established a contract sales force of approximately 60 sales representatives as of December 17, 2021 to promote JATENZO in the United States. Assuming we are able to raise additional capital, we intend to invest additional resources to expand our national footprint to approximately 100 targeted sales representatives and to bring this sales force in-house by the end of 2022. Our sales force currently targets high volume prescribing health care providers (“HCPs”) comprised of endocrinologists, urologists and primary care physicians. We continue to evaluate marketing or co-promotion arrangements to leverage our existing sales force and provide even broader JATENZO penetration in the U.S. market. We continue to explore potential strategic partnerships to assist in obtaining marketing approval for and commercialization of JATENZO outside of the United States (particularly in Europe, Asia and the Middle East). Success in achieving sales of JATENZO outside the United States could be a source of non-dilutive funding. We are also actively exploring potential business development transactions to expand our portfolio and leverage our existing sales force. 
 Since the beginning of our operations in 2004 through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Clarus Therapeutics, Inc., we have assembled a seasoned management team with significant commercial TRT and large pharmaceutical experience. President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Robert Dudley, and founder of Clarus Therapeutics, Inc., has over 30 years of experience in the T-replacement field and led the discovery, development, regulatory approval and launch of AndroGel, the first T-gel product. He also co-invented JATENZO and oversaw its development through approval by the FDA. Our senior management team includes industry veterans who have collectively more than 60 years of experience in the TRT market. 
 Our Strategy 
 Assuming we are able to raise additional capital, our goal is to build a pharmaceutical company that commercializes products complementary to our lead product, JATENZO. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include: 

• | Establish JATENZO as the preferred choice among appropriate hypogonadal men for T-replacement. We will continue to drive awareness of JATENZO by leveraging the convenience of JATENZO’s oral administration and will seek to establish JATENZO as the preferred TRT treatment for HCPs and their hypogonadal patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Accelerate the build of our commercial infrastructure to successfully grow the market for JATENZO and launch any additional products we develop or acquire. We will grow our commercial infrastructure and sales force that targets endocrinologists, urologists and PCPs who are high prescribers of TRT.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Explore additional indications for JATENZO and consider business development opportunities to grow our pipeline and product portfolio. We plan to use exploratory trials to guide the development of JATENZO for additional potential indications, including, for example, treatment of hypogonadism associated female-to-male transgender T therapy and chronic kidney disease. We will also seek to leverage the commercial launch of JATENZO with our sales organization and commercial infrastructure to develop or acquire the rights to additional complementary products or product candidates.

  Hypogonadism and the T-Replacement Therapy Market 
 Hypogonadism or T-Deficiency
Testosterone (T) is a key male sex hormone and is essential to the development of male growth. It is responsible for promoting growth of muscle mass, increasing bone density and strength, and stimulating linear growth and bone maturation. In addition, researchers increasingly have identified T as an important factor in metabolic function and other physiological processes, including the observation that normal levels help maintain energy levels and an overall sense of well-being in men. 
 Approximately 20 million men in the United States between the ages of 45 and 75 years old may have deficient levels of T, defined as circulating T levels below 300 nanograms per deciliter, based upon age-based prevalence rates published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice in 2006 and the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2012 population estimates. 
 The Endocrine Society, a professional medical organization comprised of HCPs with medical expertise in the area of hormones and related medical disorders, has published clinical guidelines identifying signs and symptoms of hypogonadism, including the following: 
 

There are two types of hypogonadism: primary, or classical, hypogonadism and secondary hypogonadism. 
 Primary hypogonadism is caused by the failure (inability) of the testes to synthesize and secrete T. Causes of primary hypogonadism include Klinefelter’s syndrome, a condition in which males have an extra X chromosome, testicular tumors, testicular damage, varicocele, which is an abnormal enlargement of the vein in the scrotum that drains blood from the testicles, disease-associated testicular damage, including that from mumps, certain systemic diseases, such as renal insufficiency, and exposure to alcohol in chronic excess. 
 Secondary hypogonadism is caused by a fault in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis that results in an inadequate gonadotropin signal to the testes to produce T. Secondary hypogonadism is relatively common among men with diseases such as type-2 diabetes and its common precursor, metabolic syndrome. For example, approximately 33% and 12% of men with type-2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, respectively, are hypogonadal, according to research published in Diabetes Care in 2007 and the Journal of Andrology in 2009. Secondary hypogonadism is also associated with obesity, chronic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 U.S. TRT Market Dynamics % 
 U.S. sales of T-replacement therapies, currently the standard treatment for T deficiency, exceeded $1.3 billion in 2020, according to Symphony Health, and almost 8 million prescriptions for T-replacement therapies are written per year. U.S. sales represent the vast majority of global TRT sales, with injections representing 36% and gels representing 58% of the U.S. sales dollars in 2020. Injections represent 75% and gels represent 24%, respectively, of all U.S. prescriptions written in 2020.

  The following graph demonstrates year-over-year prescription growth in the U.S. TRT market over the last 5 years. 
 U.S. Annual Prescriptions and Year-over-Year Growth in the TRT Market 
 
We believe there is potential for continued TRT market expansion. According to a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine in 2008, only 12% of hypogonadal men, representing less than half of all men diagnosed with hypogonadism, actually receive TRT. Additionally, the overall TRT market in 2020 grew 7% over 2019, to approximately 8 million prescriptions per year, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. This followed a 6.6% growth in prescriptions in 2019 as compared to 2018. Our expectation of continued growth and penetration in the TRT market in the United States is based on a number of factors, including: 
 

• | a growing awareness among physicians to diagnose and treat hypogonadism and willingness by patients to discuss signs and symptoms of their medical condition than in the past;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recognition and association by HCPs of the association of hypogonadism with other increasingly prevalent diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, chronic renal disease and chronic heart disease;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability to easily identify low serum T levels through a simple blood test; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | continuing guidance from medical societies (including the Endocrine Society, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American Urological Association), that clinicians measure serum T levels of patients if they present with symptoms or signs typically associated with hypogonadism.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limitations of Existing Treatments for Hypogonadism 
 The U.S. TRT market is comprised primarily of non-oral T treatments, including injections, gels, topical and buccal patches, and implanted subcutaneous pellets. Each of these products is associated with different T pharmacokinetic profiles which, in turn, can lead to significant intra- and inter-patient variabilities in circulating T response and associated symptom relief. Furthermore, each TRT delivery route has been associated with user challenges. For example, the pain of weekly deep muscle injections, skin irritation associated with the T-patch or T-gels, risk of T transference to women and children by T-gel users, potential anaphylactic reactions observed with a long-acting depot form of TU, thrice-daily administration of a nasal T preparation, and a surgical procedure for placement of T-pellets. Consequently, there has been relatively poor patient adherence and significant ‘switching’ from one TRT to another. Missing from the available armamentarium of TRT therapies was an oral T product that was effective in meeting current T-replacement regulatory standards and one not associated with potentially serious liver toxicity. Prior to JATENZO’s approval, the only oral T-replacement product approved by FDA (over 60 years ago) was methyltestosterone — a chemical cousin of T that has been associated with serious liver toxicity and thus has been rarely prescribed. Therefore, when viewed in the historical context of TRT, we believe JATENZO offers appropriate hypogonadal patients an easy-to-use, safe and effective TRT option that was not previously available. 
 Prior to 2000, with the introduction of a T-gel, T was primarily available through either scrotal or non-scrotal patches, pellets, or injections. T-injections, which became the dominant mode of administration and remain so today. However, besides having pain at the injection site, intramuscular T products carry significant risk of POME and polycythemia (i.e., increase in red blood cell count) which requires monitoring by the healthcare provider.

  With the introduction of a T-gel formulation in 2000, topical T administration became desirable because of its ease of use. However, over time common side effects including itching, irritation and discomfort at the application site became increasingly problematic for patients. Additionally, topical T-gels place partners and children at risk of T transference (secondary exposure to T when transferred from user to non-user (e.g., women and children)). This prompted the FDA to add boxed warnings to the labeling for T-gels relating to T transference. Despite these limitations, gels have continued to demonstrate significant market penetration. 
 The other approved TRT therapies have their own limitations, including gum, nasal and skin irritation and difficulty of administration (e.g., office procedure). As a result, non-oral TRT products are associated with low rates of patient compliance and adherence. More than 95,000 men change T-replacement therapies more than once per year. According to a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine in 2013, only 31% and 14% of patients were still on gel therapy six months and 12 months, respectively, after first dosing, and only about half of those who discontinued therapy later resumed treatment. 
 Our Solution — JATENZO 
 Our first commercial product, JATENZO, was approved in March 2019 by the FDA for oral TRT use in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous, or naturally produced, T, including congenital or acquired primary and secondary hypogonadism, with a boxed warning. JATENZO was the first oral T-medicine approved by the FDA in more than 60 years, the first oral T-prodrug, and the first and only oral softgel TU TRT. 
 We believe JATENZO offers hypogonadal men and prescribing physicians a safe and effective oral replacement option and has a number of advantages over the currently approved replacement therapies, including: 
 

• | Convenient Oral Dosing. JATENZO as either one or two easy-to-swallow softgels is taken twice daily with a regular meal. We believe oral dosing is preferred by most patients, is easier to use than other TRTs currently on the market and will ultimately improve the low TRT adherence rates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Normalized T Levels. After dose adjustment (if necessary), 87% of men treated with JATENZO in our clinical trials achieved average serum T levels in the normal range. In addition, JATENZO improved the classic signs and symptoms associated with hypogonadism, including psychosexual symptoms, body mass index, fat mass and bone mineral density.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Avoids Administration Challenges. Unlike other TRT products, JATENZO is an oral product and as such avoids the challenges, risks and safety issues seen with non-oral products. JATENZO avoids the risk of T transfer to partners and children that exists with gel treatment; injection site pain, risk of POME and polycythemia seen with injections, and the gum, nasal and skin irritation and difficulty of administration seen with other TRT products
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety Profile. JATENZO’s overall safety profile is generally consistent with that observed in clinical trials of other FDA approved TRTs. The modest increase in systolic blood pressure observed in men treated with JATENZO is not unique and has been observed with injectable T and other oral TU products under development in the United States or marketed outside the United States. Importantly, JATENZO has not been associated with liver toxicity in Phase 3 clinical testing that included patients treated with JATENZO for up to two years.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We commercially launched JATENZO in the United States in February 2020. In the year ended December 31, 2020, JATENZO generated net revenue of approximately $6.4 million and in the year ended December 31, 2021, JATENZO generated net revenue of approximately $14.0 million. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which had a profound effect on our ability to market JATENZO to HCPs, we achieved prescription growth month-over-month during the first two years of our launch as a result of our increasing educational efforts and increasing commercial payor coverage. 
 As of December 31, 2021, JATENZO was available and covered for approximately 70% of all insured lives. Of these patients, 77% of patients with commercial insurance had access to JATENZO. This level coverage is consistent within the class of approved T-replacement products. We anticipate being able to secure additional payor coverage for JATENZO but there is no guarantee this will occur. 
 JATENZO is available in three capsule strengths yielding five available dosing levels, for twice daily administration with food. In our pivotal Phase 3 trial of JATENZO, an open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JATENZO in adult hypogonadal male subjects referred to as the ‘inTUne trial’, JATENZO was evaluated for safety against Axiron, a then commonly prescribed topical T formulation. A total of 222 hypogonadal men were randomized, with 166 in the JATENZO group and 56 in the Axiron group. JATENZO achieved the primary endpoint, with 87% of patients treated with JATENZO achieving an average T level in the normal male range by the end of the trial period and in some cases in as little as seven days. Notably, a robust dose-titration paradigm was tested and validated such that T responses to JATENZO could be tailored to individual patient requirements if a dose adjustment was necessary. As shown in the following graphic, JATENZO also improved classic signs and symptoms associated with hypogonadism in the inTUne trial, including free (i.e., bioactive) T, psychosexual symptoms, body composition, and bone mineral density, each as illustrated in the figures below.

The safety profile of JATENZO was consistent with data generated in two earlier Phase 3 trials and the general safety profiles for TRT products as a therapeutic class. No liver toxicity was observed. The most common adverse events of JATENZO were headache (5%), increased hematocrit (5%), hypertension (4%), decreased HDL (3%), and nausea (2%). Each of the treatment-emergent adverse events of an increased hematocrit was considered by the investigator as mild in intensity. Compared to baseline, mean serum sex hormone binding globulin concentrations declined significantly in response to JATENZO but remained within the normal range after approximately three to four months of JATENZO. In parallel, concentrations of free T increased such that by the end of treatment, mean levels were significantly higher than baseline but still within the normal range. JATENZO was associated with a modest increase in average systolic blood pressure of about 3-5 mmHg — an increase consistent in magnitude with a currently marketed form of injectable testosterone. Because any increase in systolic blood pressure increases the theoretical risk of an adverse cardiovascular event (e.g., heart attack or stroke), FDA required that JATENZO (as well as an injectable T product approved in 2018 XYOSTED) to carry a boxed warning about potential increased blood pressure. Due to this risk, the boxed warning also states that use of JATENZO is only for the treatment of men with hypogonadal conditions associated with structural or genetic etiologies. We are also required by the FDA to conduct certain post-marketing studies to assess patient understanding of key risks relating to JATENZO, evaluate adrenal function with chronic JATENZO therapy, and conduct a pediatric study of JATENZO in adolescent hypogonadal patients. 
 In recent years, the FDA has mandated changes to all TRT product labeling to define the indicated uses of TRT products more explicitly and to strengthen precautions and warnings about their use. For example, language about potential cardiovascular risks, including deep vein thrombosis, now appears in TRT labeling as does a caution against TRT use in men with “age-related hypogonadism”. 
 Assuming we have sufficient capital, we plan to explore additional potential indications for JATENZO including, for example, treatment of hypogonadal men with chronic kidney disease and as T replacement in female-to-male transgender patients. We plan to conduct small exploratory Phase 4 studies to confirm our hypotheses that JATENZO therapy in these patient populations will restore T levels to the normal male range and improve other biomarkers and symptoms associated with T deficiency. We then expect to conduct Phase 3 studies based on FDA guidance that would potentially result in expanded labeling indications for JATENZO. The following table summarizes our current pipeline of product candidates.

  We will also continue to explore commercial partnerships with outside organizations to maximize the sales and marketing potential for JATENZO. Of particular interest are establishing marketing partnerships for JATENZO in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. 
 Additional Product Candidates 
 Assuming we have sufficient capital, we will seek to leverage the commercial launch of JATENZO with our sales team and commercial infrastructure to develop or acquire rights to additional complementary products or product candidates. Our business strategy is to identify complementary development and commercialization opportunities that apply our management expertise, commercial infrastructure and sales force to approved products or product candidates. Our strategy is to pursue these opportunities both on our own and with industry leading partners. We believe this strategy offers a distinct value to patients, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical partners and our stockholders. 
 In May 2021, we entered into a licensing agreement to acquire the exclusive worldwide (excluding Australia) development and commercialization rights for HAVAH T+Ai™ (CLAR-121). CLAR-121 is a proprietary combination of T (natural ligand for the androgen receptor; (“AR”)) and anastrozole (an aromatase inhibitor that blocks T conversion to estradiol) delivered by a subcutaneous implant for treatment of AR-mediated breast disease that predominantly affects women. Our initial therapeutic target will be inflammatory periductal mastitis (“PDM”) — a painful, often debilitating inflammation of breast tissue. We estimate that the annual total U.S. patient population of women with PDM is approximately 150,000. We are not aware of any effective pharmaceutical intervention for PDM and intend to seek FDA Orphan Drug designation for CLAR-121 for use in the treatment of PDM. However, there can be no guarantee that FDA will grant such designation. In addition to PDM, CLAR-121 may have potential use to treat estrogen receptor-positive (“ER+”) breast cancer as AR is a tumor suppressor in ER+ breast cancer. Of the approximately 280,000 annual cases of breast cancer in the United States, 80% of these are ER+ and 90% of ER+ breast cancers are also AR+. We will need to undertake significant development to demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety and to secure FDA approval for both of these potential uses for CLAR-121. There is no guarantee such development will be successful and result in FDA approval of CLAR-121 for either condition. 
 In September 2021, we entered into a licensing agreement with McGill University (“McGill”), Canada’s top ranked medical doctoral university, whereby we will develop and commercialize McGill’s proprietary technology to develop potential treatments for rare, endocrine, metabolic, and neurological conditions associated with primary and secondary CoQ10 (ubiquinone) deficiencies that belong to the wider class of mitochondrial diseases. 
 CoQ10 is synthesized in the inner membrane of mitochondria, a cellular organelle whose primary function is to produce the body’s chemical energy. Deficiencies of CoQ10 can lead to severe multiple organ dysfunctions that involve the brain, nerves, kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract and muscle. Oral CoQ10 is largely ineffective because it does not result in intracellular uptake of CoQ10. McGill has identified a method to substantially increase such uptake, thereby forming the basis for a new, and potentially profound, method of addressing deficiencies of CoQ10. There is no guarantee that such method will be successful. 
 Mitochondrial diseases are chronic, genetic diseases that occur when the mitochondria, structures in our body cells that produce energy from oxygen and food, fail to function properly. Mitochondrial diseases can affect almost any area of the body and can occur at any age, making them often misdiagnosed. 
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 We have built a robust internal commercial organization in the United States to market and sell JATENZO and any additional products we may develop or acquire. We have also established with a commercial outsource partner a sales force at the time of launch (February 2020) of approximately 55 representatives dedicated solely to promoting JATENZO in the United States. On December 17, 2021 we increased that number to 60 representatives. Assuming we have sufficient capital, we intend to invest additional resources to bring our sales force in-house while expanding our national footprint. Our sales force targets high prescribing endocrinologists, urologists and primary care physicians. We believe that this approach allows us to achieve broad geographic coverage while connecting with the most valuable targets. In addition, we conduct direct outreach to hypogonadal men through paid search, social media and programmatic advertising. In April 2020, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we incorporated digital assets and virtual marketing into our sales force approach, including virtual sales calls, and we expect to proceed with a hybrid virtual and in-person approach moving forward. We also intend to explore additional strategies to engage both the patient and the consumer through various direct-to-consumer modalities. The launch of any future products may require further expansion of our existing sales force. 
 In addition to developing our own commercial organization, we continue to evaluate distribution or co-promotion arrangements with established pharmaceutical companies that have either complimentary product offerings or with established pharmaceutical companies to expand the footprint for JATENZO. 
 We are considering strategic partners with demonstrated commercial capabilities to assist in obtaining marketing approval for and commercialization of JATENZO outside of the United States. We intend to seek approval and launch commercial sales of JATENZO in territories outside of the United States by establishing additional collaborations with one or more pharmaceutical company collaborators, depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the related development costs and our available resources. In May 2014, we entered into an agreement with CBC SPVI, Ltd. (“C-Bridge”), pursuant to which we and C-Bridge agreed to make commercially reasonable efforts to jointly develop a plan for the commercial manufacture, marketing, promotion, sale, distribution, and commercial importation and exportation of JATENZO and any related products in China. As part of this agreement, C-Bridge also purchased convertible promissory notes and became an investor in our company.

  We have contracted with numerous wholesale distributors, including Cardinal, McKesson Corporation and Amerisource Bergen Corporation, to distribute JATENZO to retail pharmacies. In addition to shipping our product, these distributors provide inventory and sales reports as well as other services. In exchange for these services, we pay fees to certain distributors based on a percentage of wholesale acquisition cost. We also plan to explore using alternative, non-retail channels to distribute JATENZO. 
 Manufacturing 
 We have established a comprehensive supply chain for commercial manufacture of JATENZO capsules. We rely on contract manufacturers to produce the drug substance and drug product required for our commercial supply and clinical studies. We have qualified two sources of bulk TU, entered into an exclusive manufacturing relationship for the manufacture of the softgel capsules and engaged with a commercial packager for the production of finished JATENZO capsules. All lots of drug substance and drug product used for our commercial supply and clinical studies are manufactured, packaged and labeled under current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”). The FDA inspects manufacturing facilities periodically, with the frequency based on its assessment of risk. We have established an internal quality control and quality assurance program, including a set of standard operating procedures and specifications that we believe is cGMP-compliant. 
 We expect to continue to rely on third parties for our manufacturing processes and for the production of all drug substance and drug product used for our commercial supply and clinical studies of JATENZO and any other product or product candidate we may develop or acquire. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners, to manufacture commercial quantities of JATENZO and any other product we may develop or acquire, if such product is approved in Europe or in territories outside of the United States and Europe. 
 For the commercialization of JATENZO, we have: 
 

• | qualified two sources of bulk TU, Pfizer and Xianju, both of which are subject to continuing FDA review and periodic inspection, and entered into a commercial supply agreement with each;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | entered into an exclusive manufacturing agreement with Catalent for the manufacture of JATENZO softgel capsules; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | entered into an agreement with a commercial packager for finished JATENZO capsules.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In March 2021, we entered into a supply agreement with Pfizer (the “Pfizer Agreement”), for the bulk supply of TU. We provide Pfizer estimates of our projected supply requirements. These supply forecasts are binding for an initial period, can be altered by a certain percentage over a subsequent period and then are used only to assist with Pfizer’s production planning over the final period. We have an obligation to purchase a minimum amount of TU from Pfizer, subject to an annual maximum, for the first three years of the Pfizer agreement. The price per kilogram of bulk TU under the Pfizer Agreement is fixed based on the total volume purchased during a calendar year. If Pfizer is unable to satisfy our delivery requirements, we may purchase more supply needs from an alternative supplier. The term of the Pfizer Agreement expires in January 2024. The Pfizer Agreement may be terminated by either party without cause upon 18 months’ prior written notice or upon the other party’s uncured breach of any material obligation. The Pfizer Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, indemnification, limitation on liability, assignment, confidentiality and other provisions. 
 Our January 2014 agreement with Xianju (the “Xianju Agreement”) similarly requires us to project our bulk TU supply needs for the United States. Our purchase orders are then bound by each such supply forecast for an initial period, can be altered by a certain percentage over a subsequent period and then are used only to assist with Xianju’s production planning over such projection’s final period. The price per kilogram of bulk TU under the Xianju Agreement is fixed based on the total volume purchased in a year; however, Xianju may increase the price if there are sudden changes in economic circumstances that increase the cost of production or raw materials. In addition, Xianju may request each year that the parties renegotiate the agreed upon prices from the previous year. The Xianju Agreement had an initial term of seven years and automatically renewed for two consecutive three-year terms unless either party gives notice of non-renewal no later than six months prior to the expiration of any initial or renewal term. The Xianju Agreement is also terminable by either party upon the other party’s bankruptcy, uncured material breach or for any changes in law or regulations that would render it impossible for a party to perform its material obligations. In the event of either non-renewal or termination, however, Xianju will continue to supply us with bulk TU on the terms of the Xianju Agreement for up to 18 months. The Xianju Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, indemnification, limitation on liability, assignment and confidentiality provisions, as well as provisions with respect to quality control and manufacturing procedures. 
 The JATENZO formulation is encapsulated in a softgel form. We have chosen Catalent, a third-party manufacturer, to produce clinical trial supplies and commercial quantities of JATENZO softgel capsules. JATENZO softgel capsules come in 158 mg TU, 198 mg TU, and 237 mg TU forms. We have entered into a manufacturing agreement with Catalent (the “Catalent Agreement”), which remains in effect until March 2025, six years following the date on which the FDA approved Catalent as a manufacturer of JATENZO, and automatically renews for successive two-year periods, if not terminated one year prior to the expiration of the initial term or any then-current renewal term. Either we or Catalent may terminate the Catalent Agreement upon the other party’s bankruptcy, uncured material breach or upon 24 months’ prior written notice for convenience. In addition, Catalent may terminate the Catalent Agreement or cease performing its obligations if we fail to pay amounts within ten days of being due. We are required to purchase a minimum quantity of 
 
8 

  JATENZO softgel capsules, and we are required to pay to Catalent an annual commercial occupancy fee and an annual product maintenance fee. The unit price of capsules under the Catalent Agreement is determined based on batch size and the total volume shipped in a year. The price may be increased annually based on a market price index. The Catalent Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, indemnification, limitation on liability, assignment and confidentiality provisions. 
 We, along with our contract manufacturers, are subject to extensive governmental regulations, including requirements that our products be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current cGMP. The cGMP requirements govern quality control of the manufacturing process and documentation policies and procedures. The FDA typically inspects manufacturing facilities every two years. We have established an internal quality control and quality assurance program, including a set of standard operating procedures and specifications that we believe is cGMP-compliant. 
 Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing 
 In the United States and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products to consumers depend to a significant degree on the availability of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payors increasingly are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and implementing other cost containment mechanisms. This is especially true in markets where generic options exist. It is, and will be, time consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of maintaining or seeking reimbursement for our products from Medicaid, Medicare and commercial payors. Our products and those of our partners may not be considered cost effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis, potentially resulting in contract changes with these major payors. 
 Third-party payors often utilize a tiered reimbursement system, which may adversely affect demand for our products by placing them in a more expensive patient co-payment tier. Additionally, third party payors may require step edits or prior authorizations. We cannot be certain that our products will successfully be placed on the list of drugs covered by particular health plan formularies or in a more preferential position on their formularies. Third-party payors are currently demanding, and will most likely continue to demand, more aggressive pricing and rebates for favorable formulary placement. Some U.S. states have also created Medicaid preferred drug lists and include drugs on those lists only when the manufacturers agree to pay a supplemental rebate. If our products are not included on these preferred drug lists, they may be subject to prior authorization. Physicians may not be inclined to prescribe JATENZO to their Medicaid patients, and even if they do prescribe it, Medicaid may not authorize payment, thereby diminishing the potential market for our products in this market segment. 
 Currently, most of our prescriptions are open access, and we have negotiated agreements with several pharmacy benefits managers, including Express Scripts. We offer a co-pay assistance program to patients for JATENZO under which patients covered by commercial pharmacy benefit plans receive discounts on their prescriptions. Our JATENZO GO Co-pay Assistance Program provides financial support to most commercially insured patients to assist with out-of-pocket costs of JATENZO, such that most commercial covered patients will pay $0 for their prescription. 
 Similarly, in order to ensure coverage by Medicare Part D and commercial pharmacy benefit plans, we participate in certain rebate programs, which provide discounted prescriptions to qualified insured patients. Under these rebate programs, we pay a rebate to the third-party administrator of the program. We also provide discounts to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) of the General Services Administration under an FSS contract negotiated by the Department of Veterans Affairs, including discounts mandated by the Veterans Health Care Act, discounted prescriptions to DoD’s Tricare retail pharmacy program, and discounts to federal grantees and safety net providers referred to as covered entities pursuant to our pharmaceutical pricing agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the 340B drug discount program, which is required as a condition of Medicaid coverage. Government agencies ordering under the FSS and covered entities purchase products from the wholesale distributors at the discounted price, and the wholesale distributors then charge back the difference between the current wholesale acquisition cost and the price the entity paid for the product. 
 Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and protect our proprietary rights in the United States and in other countries. To do so, we will continue to rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and confidentiality and other agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We intend to seek patent protection whenever appropriate for any product candidates, including methods for their manufacture and use, and related technology we develop or acquire in the future. 
 We have been building and continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio relating to JATENZO. We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business and seek patent protection, where appropriate, in the United States and internationally for compositions related to JATENZO, its methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. Our policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and abroad, including Europe and other major countries when appropriate, relating to proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business. 
 
9 

  However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. There is also the risk that third parties have patents or may obtain patents having claims that also cover JATENZO. For example, Lipocine asserted the use of JATENZO infringed its patents, and attacked patents and applications in our portfolio by provoking patent interferences, see Note 13 – Commitments and Contingents, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technologies, inventions, know-how and products we consider important to our business, defend our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 
 Our U.S. patent portfolio on JATENZO currently includes seven issued patents: U.S. Patent No. 11,179,402, which expires in April 2026, U.S. Patent No. 8,241,664, which expires in March 2029; U.S. Patent No. 8,492,369, which expires in December 2030, as well as U.S. Patent Nos. 8,778,916, 10,543,219, 10,617,696, and 11,179,403 each of which expires in April 2030. The issued U.S. patents contain claims to both pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment using our proprietary pharmaceutical composition and all are listed in the FDA Orange Book: Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations. In addition, we have several patent applications pending in the United States and other countries that, if issued, will cover pharmaceutical compositions, methods of treatment and other features of JATENZO, and have the potential to extend patent coverage beyond 2030. 
 We also have issued patents covering JATENZO in Australia, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea. 
 Our portfolio also contains pending applications around the world, including in the United States, Brazil, Canada and Europe. These patent applications, if they were to issue, have the potential to extend the patent coverage beyond 2030. 
 We solely own all the issued patents and the pending patent applications in our JATENZO patent portfolio. However there is risk that the USPTO could declare other interference proceedings involving patent claims that cover JATENZO as discussed in more detail in Note 13 – Commitments and Contingents, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
TU, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in JATENZO, as well as its use for treating hypogonadism, are well known in this field. Accordingly, The TU active ingredient, standing alone, is not protected by any valid and unexpired third-party patents, although there are third party patents with claims that are alleged to cover use of TU in treating hypogonadism and the use of JATENZO as discussed in more detail in Note 13 – Commitments and Contingents, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition 
 There are several approved T-replacement therapies on the market, as well as several therapies under review by the FDA. The TRT market is highly competitive, and our future success will depend on our ability to capture market share from currently approved therapies most notably injections and gels, the continued expansion of the TRT market, and our ability to operate freely with regard to or to preclude from competing against us several competitors who have also develop oral TU products, including Lipocine which has received tentative approval from the FDA and has alleged that JATENZO infringes certain Lipocine patents, as described in Note 13 – Commitments and Contingents, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Injectables 
 Injectable T-esters (e.g., T-enanthate; T-cypionate) continue to represent the majority of the prescriptions in the TRT market. Over 5.9 million prescriptions were written for T injectables (75% of all TRT prescriptions and 36% of U.S. sales) in 2020. T-injectables are predominantly given as T-cypionate (95% of all injections) and T-enanthate (1% of all injections). Injectables have experienced significant prescription growth in the U.S. market due to overall market demand for TRT and due to their generic availability and low cost. These men receive an injection every two to three weeks, most often intramuscularly, instead of applying a daily administration of other products. We believe physicians and their hypogonadal patients perceive the primary downsides of injections to be pain at injection site and risk for POME and polycythemia (excess concentration of red blood cells). Additionally, injecting T weekly or bi-weekly is associated with wide fluctuations in serum T levels between treatment cycles. For example, in many men limit of normal on day one of the injection, which may lead to undesirable side effects. Conversely, T levels often fall into the hypogonadal range before it is time for the next injection which leads to a return of undesirable symptoms. 
Gels 
 Gels represent the second largest segment within the TRT market. Over 1.9 million prescriptions were written for gels in 2020 and represented 58% of U.S. sales in 2020. The gel-based T replacement products that are currently available include AbbVie’s AndroGel®, and Endo’s Testim® and Fortesta® along with their respective authorized generics as well as generic equivalents of each version.

  The FDA has granted a therapeutic equivalence (“TE”) rating of AB to “generic” versions of approved products that have been approved via a 505(b)(2) NDA. In July 2014, the FDA granted the AB rating to Perrigo’s 1% T-gel drug product (NDA 203098) approved in January 2013, and a BX rating to Teva’s 1% gel drug product (NDA 202763) approved in February 2012. Each are versions of AbbVie’s AndroGel 1.0% and employed 505(b)(2) submissions citing AndroGel as their reference listed drugs (“RLD”). Teva’s version was found not to be bioequivalent to AndroGel, hence the BX rating. Upsher-Smith Laboratories also received approval for a version of Endo’s Testim (Vogelxo; NDA 204399) in June 2014 using the same pathway. In January of 2015, the FDA determined that Vogelxo is therapeutically equivalent to Testim and received an AB rating. In August 2015, the FDA granted AB rating to Perrigo’s 1.62% T-gel drug product (NDA 204268) which also received FDA approval in August 2015. Eli Lilly and Acrux’s Axiron had patent expiry in February 2017. On July 6, 2017, Acrux confirmed that a generic version of Axiron Topical Solution, 30 mg/1.5 mL (T-Topical Solution, 30 mg/1.5 mL) has been launched in the United States by Perrigo Company plc. Acrux also confirmed the availability of an authorized generic version of Axiron in the United States, through a marketing and distribution agreement between Lilly and a leading authorized generics company. 
 Other Current T-Delivery Methods 
 JATENZO also competes with other TRT products such as a nasal T-gel, auto-injectable subcutaneous T, buccal T and topical T-patches, and implantable subcutaneous T-pellets.
Transdermal T-patches include Allergan’s Androderm. An intramuscular depot form of TU also exists in branded form as Aveed by Endo. Additionally, Endo markets the buccal TRT Striant and the Testopel implantable T-pellets, which it acquired from Auxilium in 2015. Antares Pharma, Inc. markets a sub-cutaneous weekly auto-injector T therapy, Xyosted. Aytu BioScience Inc. markets an intranasal T therapy, Natesto, which it licensed from Acerus Pharmaceuticals in 2016. 
 Other T-Products in Development 
 We are aware of a number of products in clinical development that, if approved by the FDA, would compete with JATENZO. 
 Lipocine has developed an oral TU formulation, TLANDO. The FDA has granted tentative market approval to TLANDO for use as a TRT in adult males for conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous T, specifically congenital or acquired primary and secondary hypogonadism. In granting tentative approval, the FDA has concluded that TLANDO has met all required quality, safety and efficacy standards necessary for approval, but TLANDO has not received final approval and is not eligible for final approval and marketing in the United States until the expiration of JATENZO’s exclusivity period which expires on March 27, 2022. Like JATENZO and XYOSTED, we expect TLANDO to also carry a boxed warning about the potential for increased blood pressure because this was observed in clinical trials conducted by Lipocine. The FDA has also required Lipocine to conduct certain post-marketing studies to assess patient understanding of key risks relating to TLANDO and evaluate adrenal function with chronic TLANDO therapy, and conduct a pediatric study. In October 2021, Lipocine licensed the exclusive U.S. rights for TLANDO to Antares Pharma. In February 2022, Antares Pharma announced that the FDA accepted its NDA resubmission for TLANDO. The FDA designated the NDA as a Class 1 resubmission with a two-month review goal period and set a PDUFA date of March 28, 2022. 
 Marius Pharmaceuticals has developed an oral T-undecanoate under the name of KYZATREX as a TRT for the treatment of primary and secondary hypogonadism in adult men. The product was submitted to the FDA on January 5, 2021 with an expected PDUFA action date on October 31, 2021. Should KYZATREX meet all of the required quality, safety, and efficacy standards necessary for approval, we believe it will not receive a final approval or be eligible to receive final approval or marketing in the United States until the expiration, on March 27, 2022, of our Hatch-Waxman 3-year exclusivity period with respect to JATENZO. We expect KYZATREX labeling to carry boxed warning regarding the potential for increased blood pressure. We also believe that the FDA will require Marius Pharmaceuticals to assess patient understanding of key risks relating to KYZATREX, evaluate adrenal function with chronic KYZATREX therapy and conduct a pediatric study. 
 Mereo BioPharma Group Ltd. is currently developing BGS649, a once weekly aromatase inhibitor, for first-line therapy for the treatment of obese men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. BGS649 has completed Phase 2b testing. Based on published guidance from the FDA regarding treatment of hypogonadism with non-T approaches [Establishing Effectiveness for Drugs Intended to Treat Male Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism Attributed to Nonstructural Disorders: Guidance for Industry U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) May 2018, Clinical] we expect that development of BGS649 will be challenging. Moreover, we believe that any approval of BGS649 will result in highly restricted product labeling that will preclude its use to treat the vast majority of men with classic hypogonadism. 
 TesoRx Pharma LLC is developing an oral ‘bio-identical’ testosterone, TSX-002, for the treatment of Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty. Phase 2 clinical studies have been completed. TesoRx is also developing a potential once-daily oral TU product candidate, TSX-049, as TRT for hypogonadal in men. 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, packaging, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products. 
 
11 

  U.S. Government Regulation of Drug Products 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve a pending NDA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

• | nonclinical laboratory and animal tests that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) for each clinical site or centrally before each trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for its intended use, performed in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCPs”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA and payment of user fees;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with cGMP and GCP;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, a sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other required information, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. 
Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development, as well as amendments to previously submitted clinical trials. Further, an independent IRB for each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial, its informed consent form and other communications to study subjects before the clinical trial commences at that site. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted, including any changes to the study plans. 
 Regulatory authorities, an IRB or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA’s or the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board, which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise the sponsor to halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may be combined or overlap. 
 
12 

  •    Phase 1 — Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy volunteers or subjects with the target disease or condition. If possible, Phase 1 clinical trials may also be used to gain an initial indication of product effectiveness. 
 •    Phase 2 — Controlled studies are conducted with groups of subjects with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expansive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •    Phase 3 — These clinical trials are generally undertaken in larger subject populations to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded subject population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These clinical trials may be done at trial sites outside the United States as long as the global sites are also representative of the U.S. population and the conduct of the study at global sites comports with FDA regulations and guidance, such as compliance with GCPs. In most cases, FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single trial may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence. 
 The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 trials may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information. 
 Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial and the review and approval of the study by an IRB. Investigators must also provide information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make specified financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated and a statistical analysis plan. Information about some clinical trials, including a description of the trial and trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the U.S. National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. 
 The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country, as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse effects occur. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. 
 
13 

  Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, orphan drug designation, accelerated approval and priority review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 Under the fast-track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. To be eligible for a fast-track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides additional opportunities for interaction with the FDA’s review team and may allow for rolling review of NDA components before the completed application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. The FDA may decide to rescind the fast-track designation if it determines that the qualifying criteria no longer apply. 
 In addition, a sponsor can request breakthrough therapy designation for a drug if it is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for intensive guidance from the FDA on an efficient drug development program, organizational commitment to the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers, and, like fast-track products, are also eligible for rolling review of the NDA. Both fast track and breakthrough therapy products may be eligible for accelerated approval and/or priority review, if relevant criteria are met. 
 Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post approval studies or confirm a clinical benefit during post marketing studies will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated approval regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 Once an NDA is submitted for a product intended to treat a serious condition, the FDA may assign a priority review designation if FDA determines that the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goals. Under the current PDUFA performance goals, these six-and ten-month review periods are measured from the 60-day filing date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review from the date of submission. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on responding to requests for expanded access. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process. 
 NDA Submission and Review by the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical and preclinical testing, among other items, the results of product development, including chemistry, manufacture and controls, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA, along with proposed labeling, as part of an NDA. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. This user fee must be paid at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in some circumstances.

  In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. 
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 Once the FDA receives an application, it has 60 days to review the NDA to determine if it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review, before it files the application. Once the submission is filed by the FDA, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has set the review goal of 10 months from the 60-day filing date to complete its initial review of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity, or NME, and make a decision on the application. For priority review applications, the FDA has set the review goal of reviewing NME NDAs within six months of the 60-day filing date. Such deadlines are referred to as the PDUFA date. The PDUFA date is only a goal and the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates. The review process and the PDUFA date may also be extended if the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides certain additional information or clarification regarding the submission during the review period that amends the original application. 
 The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities, including contract manufacturers and subcontracts, are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs. 
 The FDA must refer applications for drugs that contain active ingredients, including any ester or salt of the active ingredients, that have not previously been approved by the FDA to an advisory committee or provide in an action letter a summary of the reasons for not referring it to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer drugs which present difficult questions of safety, purity or potency to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts who review, evaluate and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Once the FDA’s review of the application is complete, the FDA will issue either a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) or approval letter. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific deficiencies and provides recommendations for securing approval of the NDA. These recommendations may include additional clinical or preclinical testing or other information or analyses in order for the FDA to reconsider the application in the future. Even with the submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when the deficiencies have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product and/or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms. For example, the FDA may require a REMS as a condition of approval or following approval to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product or impose additional post-marketing requirements, based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, FDA notification and FDA review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or FDA notification may be required. 
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed or may include contraindications, warnings or precautions in the product labeling. The FDA may require certain contraindications and serious warnings to be placed in a box at the beginning of the labeling to highlight the information for prescribers, particularly those contraindications and warnings that may lead to death or serious injury. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. 
 U.S. Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising, promotion, drug shortage reporting, compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS and surveillance, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including adverse experiences. 
 
15 

  After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fee requirements for approved products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and to list their drug products and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements, which impose procedural and documentation requirements. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. 
 Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and specifications and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in withdrawal of marketing approval, mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information or other limitations, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program, among other consequences. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are consistent with the FDA approved labeling. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested in clinical trials and approved by the FDA. However, manufacturers and third parties acting on their behalf are prohibited from marketing or promoting drugs in a manner inconsistent with the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 Failure to comply with any of the FDA’s requirements could result in significant adverse enforcement actions. These include a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination of clinical trials, warning letters, untitled letters, modification of promotional materials or labeling, product recalls, product seizures or detentions, refusal to allow imports or exports, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, debarment, injunctions, fines, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, refusals of government contracts and new orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment. It is also possible that failure to comply with the FDA’s requirements relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, as well as state consumer protection laws. Any of these sanctions could result in adverse publicity, among other adverse consequences. 
 U.S. Marketing Exclusivity 
 The FDA provides periods of non-patent regulatory exclusivity, which provides the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the pharmaceutical innovation represented by its approved drug for a period of three or five years following the FDA’s approval of the NDA. Five years of exclusivity are available to new chemical entities (“NCEs”). An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt, including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds or other noncovalent bonds not involving the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, derivatives, such as a complex (i.e., formed by the chemical interaction of two compounds), chelate (i.e., a chemical compound) or clathrate (i.e., a polymer framework that traps molecules) of the molecule, responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review or approve an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, however, may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. 
 Three years of exclusivity are available for an application for a drug product containing a previously approved active moiety. To qualify for such exclusivity the NDA applicant must conduct or sponsor a new clinical investigation that FDA determines is essential to the approval of the application. Three-year exclusivity prevents the approval of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA for a drug product containing the same active moiety for the protected conditions of approval. The scope of any three-year exclusivity granted by the FDA is determined on a case-by-case basis and depends on several factors, including the FDA’s analysis of the scope of the new clinical investigations essential to approval conducted or sponsored by the applicant. JATENZO was awarded 3-year new product marketing exclusivity by the FDA. This exclusivity expires on March 27, 2022. 
 A drug can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. We may be able to provide data supporting the use of JATENZO in a pediatric population if invited to do so by the FDA. If we do so, and this data is deemed acceptable by the FDA, we may receive an additional six-month extension of any unexpired exclusivity and an additional six-month regulatory exclusivity that the FDA recognizes at the end of a patent term.

  Controlled Substances 
 The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (“CSA”) and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce. 
 The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules — Schedule I, II, III, IV or V — with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence. 
 Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s). 
 The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. 
 The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including boards of pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution. 
 Regulation outside the United States 
 We will be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations concerning the development of our product candidates outside of the United States. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval. In the United States, these laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below. 

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bride or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. On November December 20, 2020, the HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) finalized published further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Under the final rules, OIG added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. These rules (with exceptions) became effective January 19, 2021.

Pursuant to an order entered by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D has been delayed to January 1, 2023. Implementation of this change and new safe harbors for point-of-sale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and pharmacy benefit manager service fees are currently under review by the current administration and may be amended or repealed;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”), which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;

• | The federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies;

• | HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;

• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, which imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates in some cases, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”) which imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, many states also require reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made and investment and ownership interested held in the previous year to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners;

• | The ACA, which became law in the United States in March 2010, increases minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and biologic products, and creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70%, effective January 1, 2019, by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;

• | The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “MMA”) expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates;

• | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party-payors, including private insurers, and may be broader in scope than their federal equivalents; state and foreign laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures and pricing information; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances. These data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, which may complicate compliance efforts.

  In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturers may also be subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws and regulations, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and that potentially harm consumers. 
 The distribution of drugs and biological products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 In the United States, to help patients afford our approved product, we may utilize programs to assist them, including patient assistance programs and co-pay coupon programs for eligible patients. Government enforcement agencies have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement support services, and a number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, at least one insurer has directed its network pharmacies to no longer accept co-pay coupons for certain specialty drugs the insurer identified. Our co-pay coupon programs could become the target of similar insurer actions. In addition, in November 2013, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued guidance to the issuers of qualified health plans sold through the ACA’s marketplaces encouraging such plans to reject patient cost-sharing support from third parties and indicating that the CMS intends to monitor the provision of such support and may take regulatory action to limit it in the future. The CMS subsequently issued a rule requiring individual market qualified health plans to accept third-party premium and cost-sharing payments from certain government-related entities. In September 2014, the OIG of the HHS issued a Special Advisory Bulletin warning manufacturers that they may be subject to sanctions under the federal anti-kickback statute and/or civil monetary penalty laws if they do not take appropriate steps to exclude Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. Accordingly, companies exclude these Part D beneficiaries from using co-pay coupons. It is possible that changes in insurer policies regarding co-pay coupons and/or the introduction and enactment of new legislation or regulatory action could restrict or otherwise negatively affect these patient support programs, which could result in fewer patients using affected products, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business, and financial condition. 
 Third party patient assistance programs that receive financial support from companies have become the subject of enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny. The OIG has established guidelines that suggest that it is lawful for pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations who provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that such organizations, among other things, are bona fide charities, are entirely independent of and not controlled by the manufacturer, provide aid to applicants on a first-come basis according to consistent financial criteria and do not link aid to use of a donor’s product. However, donations to patient assistance programs have received some negative publicity and have been the subject of multiple government enforcement actions, related to allegations regarding their use to promote branded pharmaceutical products over other less costly alternatives. Specifically, in recent years, there have been multiple settlements resulting out of government claims challenging the legality of their patient assistance programs under a variety of federal and state laws. It is possible that we may make grants to independent charitable foundations that help financially needy patients with their premium, co-pay, and co-insurance obligations. If we choose to do so, and if we or our vendors or donation recipients are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or evolving government guidance in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to damages, fines, penalties, or other criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions. We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies, and procedures will be sufficient to protect against acts of our employees, business partners, or vendors that may violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Regardless of whether we have complied with the law, a government investigation could impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the attention of management, increase our expenses, and reduce the availability of foundation support for our patients who need assistance. 
 The full scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have continued to increase their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar actions, penalties and sanctions. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from its business. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is 
 
19 

  approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, our operations and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, included changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. The ACA included provisions of importance to our potential product candidate that: 

• | created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of “average manufacturer price,” (“AMP”) for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide point-of-sale-discounts off the negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | created a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the United States Supreme Court and members of Congress have introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. For example, an October 2017 executive order terminated the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA based on a conclusion that cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments to insurance companies required under the ACA had not received necessary appropriations from Congress and accordingly, decided to discontinue these payments immediately until those appropriations are made. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. On August 14, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in two separate cases that the federal government is liable for the full amount of unpaid CSRs for the years preceding and including 2017. For CSR claims made by health insurance companies for years 2018 and later, further litigation will be required to determine the amounts due, if any. Further, on June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued the payments were owed to them. On April 27, 2020, the United States Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s decision and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, concluding the government has an obligation to pay these risk corridor payments under the relevant formula. The United States Supreme Court is expected to rule on a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA in 2021. The implementation of the ACA is ongoing, the law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Litigation and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.

  The U.S. Congress (“Congress”) has also enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA, including decreasing the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” to $0 effective January 1, 2019 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the ACA is an essential and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore because the mandate was effectively nullified, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held the individual mandate is unconstitutional, but remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full law. In March 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear this case and oral arguments were held on November 10, 2020. The Supreme Court’s decision in this case is forthcoming. Pending review, the ACA remains in effect, but it is unclear at this time what effect the latest ruling will have on the ACA long term. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. These reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, extended the suspension period to March 31, 2021. An Act to Prevent Across-the-Board Direct Spending Cuts, and for Other Purposes, signed into law on April 14, 2021, has extended the suspension period to December 31, 2021. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In December 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865) was signed into law, which repeals the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future. 
 Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives and there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, at the federal level, the previous administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 included a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the previous administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Further, the previous administration previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contained proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. HHS has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change, which was effective as of January 1, 2019. Additionally, On December 27, 2018, the District Court for the District of Columbia invalidated a reimbursement formula change under the 340B drug pricing program, and CMS subsequently altered the Fiscal Years 2019 and 2018 reimbursement formula on specified covered outpatient drugs (“SCODs”). The court ruled this change was not an “adjustment” that was within the Secretary’s discretion to make but was instead a fundamental change in the reimbursement calculation. However, most recently, on July 31, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned the district court’s decision and found that the changes were within the Secretary’s authority. On September 14, 2020, the plaintiffs-appellees filed a Petition for Rehearing En Banc (i.e., before the full court), but was denied on October 16, 2020. Plaintiffs-appellees filed a petition for a writ of certiorari at the Supreme Court on February 10, 2021. On Friday July 2, 2021, the Supreme Court granted the petition. The 340B drug pricing program imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities. 
 Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. A July 2021 executive order affirmed the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the executive order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Because these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. Additionally, on November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Further, on December 31, 2020, CMS published a new rule, effective January 1, 2023, requiring manufacturers to ensure the full value of co-pay assistance is passed on to the patient or these dollars will count toward the Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price calculation of the drug. On May 21, 2021, PhRMA sued the HHS in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, to stop the implementation of the rule claiming that the rule contradicts federal law surrounding Medicaid rebates. It is unclear how the outcome of this litigation will affect the rule. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the current or future administrations may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the current administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs. In addition, individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, on April 18, 2020, CMS announced that qualified health plan issuers under the ACA may suspend activities related to the collection and reporting of quality data that would have otherwise been reported between May and June 2020 given the challenges healthcare providers are facing responding to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
 On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
 Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with government authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDC Act 
 Orange Book Listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA information on each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s drug product, drug substance, or an approved method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, information on each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 
21 

  The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patent information listed in the Orange Book for the approved product. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the proposed ANDA product or (v) that there are no relevant patents. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the ANDA applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
 A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has submitted a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice (“Notice Letter”) of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders no later than 20 days after the FDA issues a Paragraph IV acknowledgement letter. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the Notice Letter by the NDA and patent holders automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA also will not be finally approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can also be cited by Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicants who must make relevant patent certifications as described above for ANDA applicants. 
 To date, no Paragraph IV certification has been filed relative to JATENZO. 
 Non-Patent Exclusivities 
 JATENZO was awarded 3-year new product marketing exclusivity by the FDA. This exclusivity expires on March 27, 2022. 
 In the United States, FDA-approved products also may be eligible for 6-month pediatric exclusivity which could extend not only any unexpired non-patent exclusivities, but also the effective term of an Orange Book-listed patent, provided the FDA decides to award pediatric exclusivity on a date that is not less than nine months prior to the expiration of any patent or non-patent exclusivity. We may be able to provide data supporting the use of JATENZO in a pediatric population if invited to do so by the FDA. If we do so, and this data is deemed acceptable by the FDA, we may receive an additional six-month extension of any unexpired exclusivity and an additional six-month regulatory exclusivity that the FDA recognizes at the end of a patent term.
