Item 1. Business.
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company”, “DraftKings”, “New DraftKings” “we,” “our,” “us” and similar terms refer to DraftKings Inc, a Nevada corporation.
 
Overview
 
We are a digital sports entertainment and gaming company. We provide users with daily fantasy sports, sports betting (“Sportsbook”) and online casino (“iGaming”) opportunities, and we are also involved in the design, development, and licensing of sports betting and casino gaming software for online and retail sportsbook and casino gaming products.
 
Our mission is to make life more exciting by responsibly creating the world’s favorite real-money games and betting experiences. We accomplish this by creating an environment where our users can find enjoyment and fulfillment through daily fantasy sports contests, sports betting and iGaming.
 
We have established a following among “skin-in-the-game” sports fans brought together by our robust daily fantasy sports technology that powers millions of contest entries in peer-to-peer competitions every week. We leverage our technology, the scale and density of our user base and insights from approximately 5.5 million cumulative unique paid users to continuously improve our analytics, marketing and technology. For example, in 2013 we launched the first mobile app in daily fantasy sports, anticipating the behavioral shift of a user base that had historically relied on a desktop-only experience. Five years later, in August 2018, we launched the first mobile sportsbook in New Jersey and as of December 31, 2020, we offer our mobile sportsbook, retail sportsbook, iGaming or business-to-business products in 10 states as we continue to expand our geographic footprint.
 
Our priorities are to (a) continue to invest in our products and technology, (b) launch our product offerings in new geographies, (c) effectively integrate SBTech (Global) Limited (“SBTech” or “SBT”) to form a vertically integrated business, (d) create replicable and predictable state-level unit economics in sports betting and iGaming and (e) expand our consumer offerings.
 
We aspire to develop new and innovative products with our users in mind and to be as trustworthy as we are innovative in everything we bring to market. This is realized in what we believe to be leading-edge, proprietary technology that powers real-money games and betting experiences designed for the “skin-in-the-game” sports fan. Our vision for DraftKings has been shaped by these users, both in who they are today and who we anticipate they will become as the entertainment and gaming industries evolve. This vision underpins our position as a leader in today’s fast-growing global entertainment and gaming industries.
 
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we had revenue of $614.5 million, $323.4 million, $226.3 million, approximately 883 thousand, 684 thousand and 601 thousand average monthly unique payers (“MUPs”) and an average revenue per MUP for our business-to-consumer (“B2C”) operations (“ARPMUP”) of $51, $39 and $31. Refer to discussion in section “Key Performance Indicators – B2C Operations” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included herein for information regarding our MUPs and ARPMUP.
 
Business Combination
 
We were incorporated in Nevada as DEAC NV Merger Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of our legal predecessor, Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp. (“DEAC”), a special purpose acquisition company. On April 23, 2020, DEAC consummated the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement dated December 22, 2019, as amended on April 7, 2020, (the “Business Combination”) and, in connection therewith:

i. | DEAC merged with and into us, whereby we survived the merger and became the successor issuer to DEAC;
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | we changed our name to “DraftKings Inc.”; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | we acquired DraftKings Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Old DK”), by way of a merger; 
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iv. | we acquired all of the issued and outstanding share capital of SBTech (the “SBTech Acquisition”); and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


v. | DEAC’s publicly traded units (Nasdaq: DEACU) separated into their components of publicly traded DEAC Class A common stock (Nasdaq: DEAC) and DEAC public warrants (Nasdaq: DEACW), and each outstanding share of DEAC Class A common stock was exchanged, on a one-for-one basis, for shares of our Class A common stock and all of DEAC’s outstanding warrants became warrants to acquire shares of our Class A common stock. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon consummation of the preceding transactions:
 

(i) | Old DK and SBTech became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company; and 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | beginning April 24, 2020, our shares of Class A common stock traded on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “DKNG” and our warrants traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “DKNGW.” On July 7, 2020 we redeemed all of our outstanding public warrants that had not been exercised as of July 2, 2020 and on July 20, 2020, we delisted our publicly traded warrants. Only our Class A common stock continues to be traded on the Nasdaq.

Our Products
 
Our revenues are predominantly generated through our two reportable segments B2C and business-to-business (“B2B”) offerings.
 
Business-to-consumer
 
We have three main B2C product offerings — daily fantasy sports (“DFS”), Sportsbook and iGaming. We consider these three offerings to be of a similar class of product, and together they accounted for 96%, 95% and 97% of DraftKings’ B2C revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. DFS, which was our sole product offering until 2018, historically drove our revenue results and accounts for a majority of our users; however, since we launched Sportsbook and iGaming in 2018, states where Sportsbook and iGaming have been approved accounted for a rapidly growing proportion of our users, which has contributed to our revenue growth. In addition to our three main product offerings, our B2C segment also offers advertising and sponsorship packages to targeted advertisers across our DFS product offerings, free games and content.
 
Below is a breakdown of how each of DraftKings’ B2C offerings function:
 
Daily Fantasy Sports - Since our launch, we have monetized our DFS offering by facilitating peer-to-peer play, whereby users compete against each other for prize money. We provide users with technology that establishes DFS contests, scores the contests, distributes the prizes and performs other administrative activities to enable the “skin-in-the-game” sports fan experience. Our revenue is the difference between the entry fees collected and the amounts paid out to users as prizes and customer incentives in a period.
Sportsbook - Sports betting involves a user placing a bet by wagering money on an event at some fixed odds (“proposition”) determined by DraftKings. In the event the user wins, DraftKings pays out the bet. Similar to DFS, Sportsbook engages consumers in their sports viewing experience. Our Sportsbook revenue is generated by setting odds that are intended to provide a built-in theoretical margin in each proposition offered to our users. While the actual betting patterns of our users and outcomes of individual events may cause volatility in our revenue, we believe we can deliver a stable betting win margin over the long term.
 
Revenue is realized by taking the settled handle for betting markets that have been resolved and subtracting the payouts for these betting markets such that the difference is the gross revenue, or “hold.” In addition to our online Sportsbook, we also maintain limited retail distribution in four states, in which our retail revenue is subject to individual agreements with a land-based casino partner (a “skin”) that provide for a revenue share. Retail distribution leverages the foot traffic for existing casino properties to convert their customers to bet in our Sportsbook while on premise.
 
iGaming - iGaming, or online casino, offerings typically include the full suite of games available in land-based casinos, such as blackjack, roulette, baccarat and slot machines. For these offerings, we function similarly to land-based casinos, generating revenue through hold, or gross winnings, as users play against the house. In iGaming, we believe there is typically lower volatility versus land-based casinos since the average return to a player for specific games is easier to predict in advance based on game rules and statistics.
 
Our iGaming offering consists of a combination of games that we have built in-house and licensed content from suppliers such as International Gaming Technology, iForium, Scientific Games Corporation, Spin and Evolution for Live Dealer services. The latter are subject to standard revenue-sharing agreements specific to each supplier, whereby the supplier receives a percentage of the net gaming revenue generated from their respective casino games played utilizing our technology dependent on DraftKings’ overall gross gaming revenue for iGaming. In exchange, DraftKings receives a limited license to offer the games to users in jurisdictions where use is approved by regulatory authorities. Revenue generated through our self-developed major casino games such as blackjack results in decreased revenue share payments as a percent of revenue.
 
5


Advertising and Sponsorship - Our advertising packages range from standard ad placements and background ad placements to more high-touch integrations, such as sponsored DFS contest series or custom site takeovers. These are typically served and tracked by a range of advertising products that have been built directly into our offerings and feature partnerships with brand categories ranging from entertainment to food to automotive.
 
Each advertising package is bespoke, and we offer each client a custom “menu” of advertising options, which include online media (such as display, video and audio advertisements and page and “skin” sponsorship takeovers), custom content, including branded video content, live events such as sponsored watch parties and sponsored free or paid games, including daily fantasy, pick’em and bracket games.
 
Each advertising package has a different pricing model, with a variety of factors affecting the pricing of a particular package including, but not limited to, (i) the sport to which the package relates and (ii) the demand for, and supply of, the individual package components.
 
Sponsorships and custom-built games and content typically have fixed fee pricing. Other packages, such as custom-branded video content or online advertisements, are sold with a guaranteed number of impressions, which are priced per a certain number of guaranteed impressions. Each time a consumer sees an advertisement while playing, watching, reading or listening to a piece of content or playing a game, an impression is counted.
 
Offsetting our revenues attributable to the B2C business is the portion of gross revenue that we allocate to new and existing user incentives and promotions, which are awarded as a result of game play or at our discretion, through loyalty programs, free plays, deposit bonuses, discounts, rebates or other rewards and incentives. These offsets can be redeemed across multiple product offerings and are generally used to acquire new users, reactivate prior users and increase monetization from active users. We leverage our return on investment models that are based on lifetime value and expected reactivation rates to determine appropriate promotional levels.
 
Business-to-business
 
We supply B2B sports betting and iGaming services globally for various gaming operators, resellers and government-run lotteries. Our B2B business generates revenue from operators by providing sports betting and integration to iGaming content directly to operators in exchange for a share of operators’ revenues, as well as through fixed fee contracts with resellers. Contracts with business customers are typically awarded through a sales process or request for proposal.
 
In addition to providing for a share of gaming revenue, our B2B direct customer contracts are typically non-exclusive and run for a term of three to five years (with automatic renewal terms). Our agreements with resellers typically provide for a base fee plus a fixed monthly fee determined by the number of operators with which the reseller contracts to access our B2B software and typically run for a term of three years (with automatic renewal terms).
 
Seasonality
 
Our business, particularly our B2C segment, experiences seasonality based on the relative popularity of certain sports. Although sporting events occur throughout the year, our users are typically most active in the fourth quarter due to the overlapping calendars of the NFL and NBA seasons, which are our most popular sports.
Our Technology and Product Development
 
In order to build the best real-money games and product offerings, we have invested in core disciplines across our technology, analytics and marketing, which have allowed us to rapidly bring innovative new experiences to market while gaining a unique understanding of our users. The result has been market leadership in our industry, fueled by a brand reputation and a depth of user trust that has set us apart from our competitors.
 
Our product offerings are comprised of varying levels of proprietary and third-party software. These product offerings are bound together with a common account management and regulatory compliance service and can be accessed with the same account and wallet. Across our product offerings, we have endeavored to own the technology in-house for any critical component and to utilize a combination of new technologies, including data science and machine learning, to optimize conversion and efficiency.

DraftKings’ core product offerings are built on top of integrated, proprietary account management technology. This technology provides our users with access to their account history across all product offerings and a uniform identity verification system, which is critical in enabling seamless navigation from our national DFS audience to Sportsbook and iGaming products, as existing DFS users need not manage a separate set of account credentials and payment methods for each product offering. Our users also enjoy a highly functional wallet which, in many cases, permits user funds to flow freely from product to product. The technology is certified to safely store user payment information, which reduces our dependency on any particular payment processor, provides redundancy and gives us the flexibility to route our payment volume to a processor of our choosing. In addition, our technology is built to be customizable to the specific regulations of individual jurisdictions. Through our B2B business, we also maintain an account management service that is used by our B2B operators, and as a result, we expect to realize synergies following completion of our integration with SBTech.
 
Across our product offerings, we actively use data science and machine learning to help optimize conversion and monetization. Within the DFS offering, data science algorithms are used to customize a user’s contest home screen based upon his or her past play history. We build recommendations by identifying the type of contests that a user is most likely to play, along with the entry fee and prize structure that he or she will find most appealing. In addition, contest-pacing algorithms identify contests that might present a financial exposure and increase the contests’ visibility within the product appropriately. Similarly, within the Sportsbook offering, recommendation engines are used to present betting markets to users based upon their past play history and location. These services are also critical to our back-end infrastructure, as they drive key elements of our fraud and compliance program.
 
Marketing
 
User Acquisition and Retention - Our ability to effectively market is paramount to our operational success. Utilizing a blend of analytics and data science as our foundation, we leverage our marketing to acquire, retain and reactivate users while building a trusted consumer-facing brand. We use a variety of free and paid marketing channels, in combination with compelling offers and exciting games, to achieve our objectives. Furthermore, we optimize our marketing spend using data collected since the beginning of our operations, as well as additional data that we collect from vendors, partners and data providers. Our marketing spend is based on a return-on-investment model that considers a variety of factors, including the performance of different marketing channels, predicted lifetime value and behavior of users across various product offerings, the location of our users and our estimate of when enabling legislation and regulations for sports betting and iGaming may come to fruition.
 
Where paid marketing is concerned, we leverage a broad array of advertising channels, including television, radio, social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snap, affiliates and paid and organic search, and other digital channels such as mobile display. For Sportsbook and iGaming, these efforts are concentrated within the specific jurisdictions that have passed enabling legislation and regulations, and in which we operate or intend to operate (which vary on a per-offering basis). Our marketing expenditures tend to be highly seasonal, with most spend correlating with the start of a sports season and during its playoffs and championships.
 
In addition to traditional paid advertising channels, we cross-promote our product offerings to our existing user base through internal channels such as mobile push notifications, email and text messages, and external channels such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat. Through those channels, we use a combination of content, contests and promotions to engage existing users. Additionally, we incentivize our users to refer new users through our “Refer-a-Friend” program, offering incentives such as free entries into tournaments or free bets if the referred user ultimately interacts with our product offerings.
 
Team and League Relationships - We engage in relationships with sports leagues to improve our brand and awareness, acquire users, improve user retention and create differentiated experiences for our users.

· | In September 2019, we entered into a multi-year relationship with NFL Properties LLC and NFL Enterprises LLC in which our companies agreed to collaborate on a variety of content and product offerings on the DraftKings DFS app, as well as integrations across NFL media properties. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In July 2019, we entered into a multi-year relationship with PGA Tour, Inc and PGATOUR.COM, LLC. As part of the relationship, DraftKings’ daily fantasy golf players will have the ability to receive real-time video highlights for players in their respective lineups. Other elements of this relationship will create expanded DFS-specific content offerings and brand integration into both the PGA TOUR and DraftKings’ offerings.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In August 2020, we expanded our partnership with Major League Baseball to remain the official and exclusive daily fantasy sports partner of the league. The extension includes an expanded partnership providing for an increase in DraftKings’ content rights, product integration and prizing within DraftKings’ DFS games.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We engage in similar multi-year relationships with professional sports teams, which serve to bolster our brand affiliation and create unique collaborative integrations for our users.
 
We also engage in relationship deals with media companies to create content and integrated marketing experiences. In July 2015, we entered into a multi-year relationship with Fox Networks Group, Inc. (“FOX”), which provided DraftKings with committed media and integrations across FOX’s national, local and digital properties. With this relationship, FOX also made an investment in DraftKings. In September 2020, we entered into a multi-year agreement with ESPN to become a co-exclusive sportsbook link-out provider and exclusive daily fantasy sports link-out provider across a selection of ESPN’s digital properties. Under the agreement, we will be able to advertise our product offerings across ESPN’s digital platforms and through integrations into ESPN programming. More recently, we have established major partnerships with media entities like Vox and Bleacher Report as we seek to grow our audience of U.S. sports fans.
 
B2B Business Marketing - Our core B2B marketing strategy is centered around attending and exhibiting at major trade shows around the world. SBTech’s trade show marketing is supplemented with digital and offline marketing campaigns in leading industry publications, websites, regular media pieces and participation on industry panels. SBTech’s reputation and customer testimonials also assist in its marketing and business efforts.
Distribution
 
We distribute our B2C product offerings through various channels, including traditional websites, direct app downloads and global direct-to-consumer digital platforms such as the Apple App Store and the Google Play store. These two digital platforms are the main distribution channels for our product offerings. Our DFS product offering is delivered as a free application through both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and is also accessible via mobile and traditional websites. Our Sportsbook and iGaming product offerings are primarily distributed through the Apple App Store and a traditional website. We allow our Android Sportsbook and iGaming users to install our Sportsbook and iGaming product offerings through our website. We derive nearly all of our revenue through products distributed via the Apple App Store, Google Play Store and via traditional websites. For all of our offerings, neither Apple nor Google take any revenue share for distributing our product.
 
For our B2B segment, Sportsbook and iGaming products and services are distributed online via the Apple App Store, Google Play Store and traditional websites by operators that have licensed such products and services directly from SBTech, while retail products and services are distributed primarily via self-service betting terminals and standalone computer terminals. Similarly, Apple and Google do not take any revenue share for distributing those products and services. We also license our B2B products and services to resellers (through a fixed-fee model) who sublicense to operators, and in such cases, the reseller is responsible for the maintenance of the products and services.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our business substantially relies on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented technology and trade secrets that we use to develop and properly run our DFS, Sportsbook and iGaming offerings and related services. We also create intellectual property that includes proprietary daily fantasy sports, sports betting and iGaming-related technology and content as well as proprietary data acquired from the use of our daily fantasy sports, sports betting and iGaming product offerings.
 
8


While most of the intellectual property we use is created by us, we have obtained rights to use intellectual property of third parties through licenses and service agreements with those third parties. Although we believe these licenses are sufficient for the operation of the company, these licenses typically limit our use of the third parties’ intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods.
 
We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We also engage in monitoring the activities of third parties with respect to potential infringing uses of our intellectual property by third parties.
 
We actively seek patent protection covering inventions originating from us and, from time to time, review opportunities to acquire patents to the extent we believe such patents may be useful or relevant to our business.
 
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, trade dress, domain name and patents to protect our DFS, Sportsbook and iGaming product offerings and other intellectual property. We typically own the copyright to the software code to our content, as well as trademarks under which our DFS, Sportsbook and iGaming product offerings and related services are marketed. We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in locations outside the United States. Our registered trademarks in the United States include “DraftKings,” and the names of our services and applications, among others.
 
Competition
 
We operate in the global entertainment and gaming industries with our business-to-consumer offerings such as DFS, Sportsbook and iGaming, and our business-to-business offerings. Our users face a vast array of entertainment choices. Other forms of entertainment, such as television, movies, sporting events and in-person casinos, are more well established and may be perceived by our users to offer greater variety, affordability, interactivity and enjoyment. We compete with these other forms of entertainment for the discretionary time and income of our users.
 
The specific industries in which we operate are characterized by dynamic customer demand and technological advances, and there is intense competition among online gaming and entertainment providers. A number of established, well-financed companies producing online gaming and/or interactive entertainment products and services compete with our offerings, and other well-capitalized companies may introduce competitive services. There has also been considerable consolidation among competitors in the entertainment and gaming industries and such consolidation and future consolidation could result in the formation of larger competitors with increased financial resources and altered cost structures, which may enable them to offer more competitive products, gain a larger market share, expand offerings and broaden their geographic scope of operations.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
As a multinational technology company with over 2,600 employees located in eight countries, our business success is driven by our highly skilled workforce. With our global technology and product team, consisting of over 1,350 employees (which includes over 1,100 engineers), we are well positioned to deliver new, innovative and exciting products to our growing base of customers.
 
At DraftKings, we recognize that engaging and developing our employees is a key to our success and we rely on attracting and retaining our talent to deliver on DraftKings’ goal to be a leader in today’s fast-growing global entertainment and gaming industries. We routinely gauge our employees’ level of engagement and satisfaction through quarterly pulse surveys. These surveys ensure we hear directly from our valuable employees on how we can better focus on the following areas: (i) DraftKings’ mission/vision, (ii) role clarity and engagement, (iii) employee development and (iv) inclusion, equity and belonging.
 
We have committed to and formalized employee development programs that support inclusion, equity and belonging, and promote creativity and innovation through various leadership and talent management programs. DraftKings’ talent training programs are designed to provide increased career and internal mobility for our employees, identify development opportunities, and proactively support succession planning.

We also offer our employees a holistic total rewards package with premier health and welfare programs for employees and family members. In addition, every employee is eligible for equity awards to share in the Company’s financial success. Our unlimited paid time off programs enable our workforce to enjoy personal time away from their job responsibilities.
 
In early March 2020, we took swift action to protect our employees’ health in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including closing our offices. We have encouraged most of our employees to work from home through at least July 2021, when we plan to reassess the global health situation and make decisions about the timing of reopening our offices, with the safety of our employees being the highest priority. In the meantime, we have implemented health and safety protocols in our offices to ensure that we are ready for the safe return of our employees to our offices when the time comes. In order to ensure the success of our employees during the shift to remote work, we developed training resources for managers to ensure they had the proper skills to lead remote teams and delivered trainings to employees on how to be effective while working remotely.
 
Government Regulation
 
DraftKings is subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that affect our ability to operate our DFS, Sportsbook and iGaming product offerings. These product offerings are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulations that could change based on political and social norms and that could be interpreted in ways that could negatively impact our business.
 
The gaming industry (inclusive of our iGaming and Sportsbook product offerings) is highly regulated and we must maintain licenses and pay gaming taxes or a percentage of revenue where required by the jurisdictions in which we operate in order to continue our operations. Our business is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, integrity and character of the owners, managers and persons with material financial interests in the gaming operations along with the integrity and security of the iGaming and Sportsbook product offerings. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in that and other jurisdictions.
 
Gaming laws are generally based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect gaming consumers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize state and local tax revenues, as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish stringent procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character and responsibility.
 
Licensing and Suitability Determinations
 
In order to operate in certain jurisdictions, we must obtain either a temporary or permanent license or determination of suitability from the responsible authorities. We seek to ensure that we obtain all necessary licenses to develop and put forth our offerings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and where our users are located.
 
Gaming laws in certain jurisdictions require us, and each of our subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, certain of our directors, officers and employees, and in some cases, certain of our shareholders, to obtain licenses from gaming authorities. Such licenses typically require a determination that the applicant qualifies or is suitable to hold the license. When determining whether to grant such a license to an applicant, gaming authorities generally consider: (i) the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant (including verification of the applicant’s sources of funding); (ii) the quality and security of the applicant’s online real-money gaming platform, hardware and related software (including the platform’s ability to operate in compliance with local regulation, as applicable); (iii) the applicant’s history; (iv) the applicant’s ability to operate its gaming business in a socially responsible manner; and (v) in certain circumstances, the effect on competition.
 
Gaming authorities may, subject to certain administrative procedural requirements, (i) deny an application, or limit, condition, revoke or suspend any license issued by them; (ii) impose fines, either on a mandatory basis or as a consensual settlement of regulatory action; (iii) demand that named individuals or shareholders be disassociated from a gaming business; and (iv) in serious cases, liaise with local prosecutors to pursue legal action, which may result in civil or criminal penalties.
 
10


Events that may trigger revocation of such a gaming license or another form of sanction vary by jurisdiction. However, typical events include, among others: (i) conviction in any jurisdiction of certain persons with an interest in, or key personnel of, the licensee of an offense that is punishable by imprisonment or may otherwise cast doubt on such person’s integrity; (ii) failure without reasonable cause to comply with any material term or condition of the gaming license; (iii) declaration of, or otherwise engaging in, certain bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or discontinuance activities, or an order or application with respect to the same; (iv) obtaining the gaming license by a materially false or misleading representation or in some other improper way; (v) violation of applicable anti-money laundering or terrorist financing laws or regulations; (vi) failure to meet commitments to users; (vii) failure to pay in a timely manner all gaming or betting taxes or fees due; or (viii) determination by the gaming authority that there is another material and sufficient reason to revoke or impose another form of sanction upon the licensee.
 
Product-Specific Licensing
 
Daily Fantasy Sports
 
DraftKings’ DFS is available in 43 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and eight international jurisdictions. In those states that currently require a license or registration for DFS operations, DraftKings has either obtained from the relevant regulatory authority, the appropriate license or registration, has obtained a provisional license, or is operating pursuant to a grandfathering clause that allows operation pending the availability of licensing applications and subsequent grant of a license. DraftKings also has three foreign DFS licenses and operates under those licenses in eight countries. Various state laws and regulations govern our licenses, but generally such state laws and regulations define paid fantasy sports, establish the rules concerning the application and licensure procedures for gaming operators in the fantasy sports business and regulate practices for paid fantasy sports deemed to be detrimental to the public interest. As part of the licensing process, we must submit, in some jurisdictions, extensive materials on our operations, including our technology and data security, age verification of users, segregation of account funds and responsible gaming initiatives.
 
In the United States, our DFS licenses are generally granted for a predetermined period of time (typically ranging from one to four years) or require documents to be supplied on a regular basis in order to maintain our licenses. We also maintain DFS licenses in Great Britain, Malta and Australia.
 
In Great Britain, online gaming and sports betting is subject to the Gambling Act 2005 (the “GA2005”), as amended by the Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Act 2014, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Under the GA2005, entities wishing to offer online sports betting (which for purposes of GA2005 is defined to include DFS) and/or online casino services to persons located in Great Britain must first obtain a remote gambling operating license from the Gambling Commission. We hold a remote-pool-betting operating license authorizing us to offer our DFS product to residents of Great Britain. That license may be varied to add further product categories permitting, for example, fixed-odds-sports betting and online casinos. We also hold a gambling software operating license issued by the Gambling Commission, which authorizes us to develop the DFS software we use. Our British licenses are not limited by a term, subject to the payment of annual fees and compliance with license conditions.
 
In Malta, online gaming and sports betting is subject to the Gaming Act 2018 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Fantasy sports (including DFS) are considered a controlled skill game for the purposes of the Gaming Authorizations Regulations. Our subsidiary, Crown DFS Malta Limited, holds a gaming services license, issued by the Malta Gaming Authority, which authorizes the holder to conduct controlled skill games. Our Malta license was originally issued in 2017. Under the Gaming Act 2018, it has a duration of 10 years.
 
Malta is a Member State of the European Union, and that has made it an increasingly popular hub for online betting and gaming businesses. We rely upon our Malta license to conduct DFS operations not only in Malta, but also in certain other EU Member States, including Germany, Austria, the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands.
 
In Australia, online gaming and sports betting is regulated at both the federal and state/territory levels. A sports betting operator that holds a license in one state or territory may offer services across all other states (subject to certain specific statutory restrictions that may apply). Our subsidiary, DraftKings Australia Pty Ltd, is the holder of a sports bookmaking license issued by the Northern Territory Racing Commission, which enables DraftKings Australia Pty Ltd to conduct DFS contests. The Northern Territory license was issued in November 2017 for a duration of five years, subject to the payment of annual fees and compliance with license conditions.

Sportsbook
 
As of December 31, 2020, 22 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized some form of sports betting. Of those 23 legal jurisdictions, fifteen have legalized online sports betting. Of those fifteen jurisdictions, thirteen are live, and DraftKings operates in ten of them. As of December 31, 2020, we operate our online sports betting product via the DraftKings Sportsbook app in Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia pursuant to our licenses, temporary licenses, or executed vendor agreements granted by the gaming or lottery commission of such states, specifically, the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission, the Illinois Gaming Board, the Indiana Gaming Commission, the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission, the New Hampshire Lottery Commission, the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, the Tennessee Education Lottery Corporation and the West Virginia Lottery. We also operate retail sportsbooks in Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey and New York pursuant to state licensing regimes. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we also operate our online sports betting product in Virginia pursuant to a license granted by the Virginia Lottery and in Michigan pursuant to a license granted by the Michigan Gaming Control Board.
 
On May 14, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion determining that PASPA was unconstitutional. PASPA prohibited certain states from “authorizing by law” any form of sports betting. In striking down PASPA, the Supreme Court opened the potential for state-by-state authorization of sports betting. Several states and territories, including Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, Washington, D.C. and West Virginia already have laws authorizing and regulating some form of sports betting online or in brick-and-mortar establishments. Sports betting in the United States is subject to additional laws, rules and regulations at the state level. See “Risk Factors - Risk Factors Relating to our Business and Industry - Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business. Any change in existing regulations or their interpretation, or the regulatory climate applicable to our products and services, or changes in tax rules and regulations or interpretation thereof related to our products and services, could adversely impact our ability to operate our business as currently conducted or as we seek to operate in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.”
 
iGaming
 
As of December 31, 2020, we operate our iGaming product in New Jersey, pursuant to a transactional waiver granted by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, in Pennsylvania, pursuant to a license granted by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, and in West Virginia, pursuant to an interim license granted by the West Virginia Lottery. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, we also operate our iGaming technology in Michigan pursuant to a provisional supplier license granted by the Michigan Gaming Control Board.
 
Generally, online gambling in the United States is only lawful when specifically permitted under applicable state law. At the federal level, several laws provide federal law enforcement with the authority to enforce and prosecute gambling operations conducted in violation of underlying state gambling laws. These enforcement laws include the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (the “UIGEA”), the Illegal Gambling Business Act and the Travel Act. No violation of the UIGEA, the Illegal Gambling Business Act or the Travel Act can be found absent a violation of an underlying state law or other federal law.
 
In addition, the Wire Act of 1961 (the “Wire Act”) provides that anyone engaged in the business of betting or wagering knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest, or for the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers, or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, will be fined or imprisoned, or both. However, the Wire Act notes that it shall not be construed to prevent the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of information for use in news reporting of sporting events or contests, or for the transmission of information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on a sporting event or contest from a state or foreign country where betting on that sporting event or contest is legal into a state or foreign country in which such betting is legal. There is ongoing legal action as to whether the Wire Act applies beyond sports betting. A federal court of first instance has ruled that it does not; the decision was appealed but rejected on January 20, 2021 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

Additionally, our B2B business has certified its software in various territories, including in Denmark, Italy, Nigeria, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and Sweden, and its services are available in Azerbaijan, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Greece, Mexico and Spain under local licenses held by operators using SBTech’s products and services in these jurisdictions.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we supply our SBTech products and services, sportsbook and iGaming services online in New Jersey and our SBTech products and services and sportsbook online in Oregon pursuant to an agreement with the Oregon State Lottery. We also supply retail sportsbook services in Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and Pennsylvania pursuant to state licensing regimes. In addition, we supply our SBTech products and services, sportsbook and iGaming services to customers in additional jurisdictions.
 
Data Protection and Privacy
 
In addition to our licensing regime for our offerings, we also take significant measures to protect users’ privacy and data. Our programs consist of the following:
 
Because we handle, collect, store, receive, transmit and otherwise process certain personal information of our users and employees, we are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws related to the privacy and protection of such data. Regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, which is a new, untested law, could affect our business, and its potential impact is unknown.
 
With our operations in Europe, we may also face particular privacy, data security and data protection risks in connection with requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (EU) 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) and other data protection regulations. Any failure to comply with these rules may result in regulatory fines or penalties including orders that require us to change the way we process data. In the event of a data breach, we are also subject to breach notification laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the GDPR, and the risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.
 
Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, interpretations of laws or regulations, or market practices, regarding the use of personal data, or regarding the manner in which we seek to comply with applicable laws and regulations, could require us to make modifications to our products, services, policies, procedures, notices, and business practices, including potentially material changes. Such changes could potentially have an adverse impact on our business.
 
Compliance
 
We have developed and implemented an internal compliance program to help ensure that we comply with legal and regulatory requirements imposed on us in connection with our DFS, Sportsbook and iGaming activities. Our compliance program focuses on, among other things, reducing and managing problematic gaming and providing tools to assist users in making educated choices related to gaming activities.
 
SBTech offerings have been built from the ground up to meet the needs of differing regulatory regimes, including configurable regulatory and responsible gaming controls such as responsible gaming tests, operator alerts on player behavior, deposit limits, betting limits, loss limits, timeout facilities, session limits, reality checks, balance thresholds and intended gaming amounts. These features allow the operators’ customers full control of their gaming to allow them to play responsibly.
 
Responsible and Safer Gaming
 
We view the safety and welfare of our users as critical to our business and have made appropriate investments in our processes and systems. We are committed to industry-leading responsible gaming practices and seek to provide our users with the resources and services they need to play responsibly. Additionally, all our employees take responsible gaming training with mandatory periodic refresher training, overseen by our compliance team.
