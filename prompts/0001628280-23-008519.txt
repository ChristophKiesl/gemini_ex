Item 1. Business
Overview
Proterra’s mission is to advance electric vehicle technology to deliver the world’s best performing commercial vehicles.
 Commercial and industrial fleets are expected to adopt electric vehicles at increasingly higher rates over the next two decades, driven by factors including emissions targets and regulations, and lower operating costs. More than 200,000 new electric buses, medium-duty trucks, and heavy-duty trucks are expected to be sold in the industry by 2030 and approximately 650,000 by 2040 in our core markets of North America and Europe. Assuming average battery capacity per vehicle of 225 kWh for medium-duty trucks, 300 kWh for buses and 750 kWh for heavy-duty trucks, we estimate this could translate into demand for heavy-duty commercial and industrial-scale batteries of approximately 90 GWh in 2030 and approximately 300 GWh in 2040 in such markets. Our business strategy is to capitalize on this opportunity.
In the first quarter of 2023, we announced the appointment of Julian Soell as the Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and Christopher Bailey as Chief Business Officer of the Company, each appointment effective as of March 1, 2023. With these appointments, we consolidated all of our product lines under one Chief Business Officer and all our operations under one Chief Operating Officer, from organizing our business around business groups (called Proterra Transit and Proterra Powered & Energy, respectively) each lead by a President. In addition, we announced workforce restructuring plans designed to improve operational efficiency with the reduction of our workforce by up to twenty five percent or the elimination of approximately 300 jobs and the closure of our City of Industry manufacturing facility by December 31, 2023. 
We have three commercial offerings each addressing a critical component of commercial vehicle electrification.
•Proterra Powered & Energy. Proterra Powered products are our proprietary battery systems and electrification solutions for global commercial vehicle original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers serving the Class 3 to Class 8 vehicle segments, including delivery trucks, school buses, and coach buses, as well as construction and mining equipment, and other applications. Proterra Energy products and services offer turnkey fleet-scale, high-power charging solutions and software services, ranging from fleet and energy management software-as-a-service, to fleet planning, hardware, infrastructure, installation, utility engagement, and charging optimization. These solutions are designed to optimize energy use and costs, and to provide vehicle-to-grid functionality. 
•Proterra Transit. We design, develop, manufacture, and sell electric transit buses as an OEM for North American public transit agencies, airports, universities, and other commercial transit fleets. Proterra Transit vehicles showcase and validate our electric vehicle technology platform through rigorous daily use by a large group of sophisticated customers focused on meeting the wide-ranging needs of the communities they serve.
Our industry experience, the performance of our transit buses, and compelling total cost of ownership has helped make us the leader in the U.S. electric transit bus market. With over 1,000 electric transit buses delivered, our electric transit buses currently have delivered more than 35 million cumulative service miles spanning a wide spectrum of climates, conditions, altitudes and terrains. From this experience, we have been able to continue to iterate and improve our technology. 
Our decade of experience supplying battery electric heavy duty transit buses provided us the opportunity to validate our products’ performance, operational efficiency and maintenance costs with a demanding customer base and helped broaden our appeal as a key electrification solutions supplier to OEMs in other commercial vehicle segments and geographies. Proterra Powered’s strategy is to leverage Proterra Transit’s success in the electric transit bus market and domain expertise to showcase the performance of our technology and demonstrate a strong track record of range and reliability in order to provide our battery systems and electrification solutions to

other commercial vehicle segments. We believe our success in the transit bus market using our battery systems and electrification solutions to power heavy-duty vehicles with better performance and operating characteristics than a diesel-powered bus, all while maintaining a rigorous regular schedule of operation with little tolerance for error, helps demonstrate the broad applicability of our technology to other commercial vehicle segments with similar requirements. We sell our battery systems and electrification solutions using a business development team as well as a channel sales team for certain end markets. These teams work closely with our engineering team to develop optimal electrification solutions for our customers, adapted to their vehicle requirements.
Proterra Powered has partnered with more than a dozen OEMs spanning from Class 3 to Class 8 trucks, several types of buses, and multiple off-highway categories. Through December 31, 2022, Proterra Powered has delivered battery systems and electrification solutions for more than 1,600 vehicles to our OEM partner customers.
In addition, Proterra Energy has established us as a leading commercial vehicle charging solution provider by helping fleet operators fulfill the high-power charging needs of commercial electric vehicles and optimize their energy usage, while meeting our customers’ space constraints and continuous service requirements. As of December 31, 2022, we had installed more than 95 MW of charging infrastructure across North America.
Through December 31, 2022, we have generated the majority of our revenue from Proterra Transit’s sales of electric transit buses, complemented by additional revenue from Proterra Powered’s sales of battery systems and Proterra Energy’s sales and installation of charging systems, as well as from the sale of spare parts and other services provided to customers. As fleet electrification continues to expand beyond buses to trucks and other commercial vehicles, we expect Proterra Powered & Proterra Energy to grow into a significantly larger portion of our overall business and generate a greater portion of revenue. Through December 31, 2022, our chief operating decision maker, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates Proterra’s results on a consolidated basis for purposes of making decision on allocating resources and assessing financial performance, resulting in a single reportable segment.
We delivered 199, 208, and 170 new transit buses in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We also delivered 14 and 9 pre-owned buses in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We delivered battery systems for 1,229 vehicles, 273 vehicles, and 107 vehicles in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our total revenue was $309.4 million, $242.9 million, and $196.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, in aggregate, we have generated revenue of $749.2 million for the past three years. We generated a gross loss of $(24.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and a gross profit of $2.1 million and $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have also invested significant resources in research and development, operations, and sales and marketing to grow our business and, as a result, generated losses from operations of $220.9 million, $127.6 million, and $96.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Our products
We design, manufacture, and sell proprietary battery systems, electrification and charging solutions and fleet and energy management systems purpose-built for commercial vehicles. Our battery systems, electrification and charging solutions and fleet and energy management systems are also used in electric transit buses that we design, sell, and manufacture. Our Proterra Energy business also provides charging infrastructure solutions to simplify the adoption of electric commercial vehicles and improve fleet operations, as well as software services relating to fleet management, remote diagnostics, smart charging and vehicle-to-grid energy management.
Battery system
Our highly modular battery systems meet the needs of a variety of commercial vehicle segments and sizes. We sell our battery packs in two different widths and three different heights depending upon the frame rail length constraints of the vehicle. In addition, each module is available in two different lengths, and three different voltages (25V, 35V and 50V). Modules can be strung in series up to 1,200V within a pack. Packs can be combined up to 16 strings in parallel.
We design, validate, test, and manufacture high-voltage battery packs that are used in our electric transit buses, as well as other commercial vehicle applications. We have designed our batteries based on the core principles of modularity, durability, safety, and scalability.
Our batteries have been designed around standardized form factor cylindrical cells that are produced by numerous global cell manufacturers. Our battery design is flexible to chemistry and manufacturer, allowing us to utilize the best cells commercially available in terms of energy density, cost, cycle life performance, charge rate acceptance, and safety. We have worked with LG Chem Ltd., now LG Energy Solution, to develop cells that are optimized for our applications. Each module contains a proprietary battery monitoring board, and each pack contains a proprietary battery management system, which together monitor the performance of the battery pack and communicate with the vehicle.
We engineered the battery pack with safety and durability as core principles. The battery enclosure is a rugged structure, built using aluminum extrusions and castings, and may include an aluminum base plate to protect the cells. The module and enclosure architecture are designed to be safe in extreme mechanical and environmental abuse scenarios. We internally test our battery cells, modules, and packs to ensure they meet our durability, cycle life performance, and safety and warranty requirements.
Inherent to the mechanical and electrical architecture of our battery modules and battery packs is the flexibility to rapidly reconfigure components for use in various commercial vehicle applications. Battery modules and packs can be connected electrically in a series of strings to increase system voltage up to 1,200V. Additionally, multiple strings can be connected in parallel to enable megawatt-hour-scale battery systems. While our battery system is optimized for commercial vehicle applications, we have also created an architecture with second-life use in mind. For instance, our battery packs are designed to be stackable in order to be deployed with minimal modification in stationary energy storage applications.
We operate a battery research and development laboratory at our Burlingame headquarters, co-located with battery engineering, advanced manufacturing engineering, and manufacturing operations. Capabilities of this lab include mechanical and environmental durability testing, highly accelerated life testing, electrical safety testing, cell lifecycle and safety testing, mechanical abuse testing, and prototype assembly for new applications. Prototype and production variants of our battery products are tested and certified to industry standards, including Society of Automotive Engineers (“SAE”) J2929, as well as proprietary internal test requirements.
Electric drivetrains
A key driver of vehicle performance, and biggest consumer of battery energy, is the drivetrain, which includes the traction motor, inverter, controller, and gearbox. We have partnered with leading engineering and manufacturing companies to offer both single- and dual-motor drivetrains. These are the 275 continuous horsepower ProDrive 2.0 system and the 338 continuous horsepower DuoPower system. Both utilize three-phase, permanent-magnet, liquid-cooled motors. In contrast to internal combustion engines, electric motors provide very 
Table of Contents

high torque for superior hill-climb ability. Proterra couples this with a multi-speed gearbox to deliver that torque across a wide range of vehicle speeds. These systems provide superior performance to a comparably sized commercial diesel vehicle, and provide a higher ‘regen’ efficiency when the bus is braking. Our drivetrains also have significant advantages over traditional powertrains in weight and serviceability. Our motor weighs 90 kilograms, compared to over 800 kilograms for a typical diesel engine, and may be removed in four hours, compared to 12 hours for a standard diesel engine.
The traction motor inverter is a liquid-cooled power electronics unit that converts high-voltage battery direct-current into AC power required for the desired torque and speed of the traction motor. This unit operates bi-directionally, acting as the control to turn the motor into a regenerative brake, recovering energy back into the battery packs. The drivetrain controller translates the accelerator and brake pedal commands into torque and speed commands for the inverter. The drivetrain controls a number of safety functions, including anti-lock brake system activation, hill-hold features, and programmable responsiveness for both acceleration and regeneration. We believe that multispeed gearboxes, paired with small high-performance motors, provide our customers compelling value, performance, and vehicle range.
High-voltage systems, controls, and telemetry gateways
To integrate the battery, drivetrain, charging, and other vehicle hardware, we developed a controls architecture for optimal system function, reliability, and safety. The core components of the control system are the battery management system, the charge controller that manages the interface between the battery and the charging system during charging, the telematics unit that provides wireless connectivity and supports vehicle monitoring and analytics, the drivetrain controller that interfaces with the motor and inverter, the vehicle controller that manages all base vehicle systems, including the high voltage and thermal systems, and the body controller that manages customer configurable functions such as HVAC, doors, lighting, and vehicle ride height.
Developed expressly for heavy duty and high-occupancy vehicle applications, our battery management system (“BMS”) and battery monitoring board (“BMB”) hardware, software, and patented control algorithms are designed to ensure safe and reliable operation in all commercial vehicle applications. The BMS is deployed on an automotive grade controller within the battery pack responsible for actively and safely managing a lithium ion battery pack. It controls the battery pack electrical contactors, monitors all relevant parameters, determines real-time state and limits designed to ensure safe and reliable operation, and communicates with the vehicle. Moreover, the BMS performs electrical safety functions such as isolation monitoring and high voltage interlock control. These functions are critical to performance and safety. Additional functions performed include measuring cell operating parameters such as voltage, temperature, and relative humidity and performing dissipative cell balancing. 
These units and other devices, such as dashboard displays and other onboard electronics, are interconnected with industry standard Controller Area Network (“CAN Bus”) vehicle networking. Our controls team uses model-based control architecture to create software for each of these units and ensure proper validation through automated software testing. At the system level, we use these models in conjunction with industry-standard Hardware-In the-Loop and Software-In the-Loop test set-ups, which allow for full vehicle simulation and development.
ZX5 electric transit bus
The Proterra electric transit bus is our flagship product and the only finished vehicle we manufacture ourselves as an OEM. In 2014, we launched our first 40-foot electric low-floor transit bus seating up to 40 people, followed one year later by a 35-foot version seating up to 29 people. We focus on 35-foot and 40-foot buses because these buses represent more than three-quarters of the market according to the Federal Transit Authority’s National Transit Database. Currently offered with battery sizes up to 492 kWh on the 35-foot and base 40-foot, and up to 738 kWh on the ZX5 Max variant, our buses can provide a range of up to 340 miles on a single charge. With the batteries mounted in ballistic-grade enclosures below the floor of the vehicle between the axles, the bus has been designed to optimize mass distribution and safety. Enabled by our battery and electric drive train technology and a body made of light-weight composite materials, our purpose-built electric transit bus also offers compelling acceleration, gradeability, and energy efficiency. Along with zero tailpipe emissions and low 
Table of Contents

maintenance costs, the Proterra Electric Transit Bus offers a compelling value proposition to transit agencies seeking to electrify their fleets.
While other manufacturers use a modified steel body and frame that was originally designed for an internal combustion engine, we have partnered with a supplier, TPI Composites, Inc, to architect a lighter weight bus body with advanced materials specifically designed for an electric powertrain. Our composite bus body houses the battery packs below the floor of the vehicle, between the axles, to achieve a low center of gravity and ride comfort and safety. Utilizing carbon fiber and fiberglass, our design approach optimizes mass, stiffness, and durability. Our bus body has been tested on a four-post shaker table to a simulated 750,000 miles and 18 years of useful life, and has also undergone 125,000 effective miles at the Bus Research and Testing Center’s test track in Altoona, Pennsylvania which executes federally mandated transit vehicle durability testing.
The ZX5 bus can be charged by either a standard J1772 CCS charge port for in-depot charging, or a J3105 standard-compliant overhead pantograph charger, offering an estimated charge time of three hours. The latter can be deployed in-depot or used as an on-route charger for charge replenishment.
Our electric transit bus can also offer significant total cost of ownership savings as compared to the equivalent diesel- and natural gas-powered buses. Our electric transit bus uses approximately 75% less energy per mile than the average legacy diesel bus. In a typical transit operation, the total cost of ownership of our bus is lower than diesel, diesel-hybrid, and compressed natural gas-powered vehicles. Our electric transit bus combines a competitive upfront price with low operations and maintenance costs, which we estimate results in a lower total cost of ownership over the lifetime of the vehicle.
Proterra Transit electric buses can also be acquired with a battery lease through our battery leasing program. We offered this program in 2021 through a partnership with Mitsui, whose contract with us ended in March 2022. We are currently offering this program directly. This program enables the customer to pay for the price of the battery over time rather than upfront with the price of the bus. Given the operational savings our buses typically offer in both fuel and maintenance costs, we seek to structure the battery lease payments so they are covered by the operating cost savings.
Fleet-scale charging solutions
Fleet charging requires a complex balance of multiple stakeholder groups, fleet logistics, battery operational requirements, variable charging times and power, and electric utility engagement, which together present more challenges than passenger vehicle charging. Successful charging infrastructure implementation is critical to scaling the deployment of commercial electric vehicles. We have designed our charging solutions with a focus on high power, scalability, bi-directional power capability, autonomous charge docking, and charge management. We believe our software algorithms and planning solutions can enable as much as 50% fewer chargers, while optimizing both charging time and energy costs. 
We currently offer five charger capacities for small fleet solutions: 60 kW, 90 kW, 120 kW, 150 kW, and 180 kW. We also offer a Megawatt class of charger for large fleet solutions. Our charger architecture is designed for commercial fleet applications and allows for the larger charging hardware cabinet to be placed up to 500 feet away from the charger dispensers. This architecture provides commercial fleets with more siting flexibility in depots with limited space. The dispensers can be ground-, wall-, or overhead structure-mounted to meet a customer’s specific requirements. Charging systems include a wireless data connection to our Valence software platform that allows for over-the-air software updates. 
Valence software platform
The Proterra Valence (formerly called APEX) connected vehicle intelligence system is a cloud-based data platform that can provide customers performance information about their fleets, and is designed to provide management of vehicle and charging operations to reduce operating costs. 
Our hardware and software connectivity platform is designed for compatibility with each vehicle and charging system that we deliver. Each gateway on a vehicle or charging system automatically connects securely with our cloud-based platform. Applications that run on this platform are accessible to registered users through a role-

based, access-controlled web portal. Our data exploration tools offer users current and historical metrics, insights, and reports. Metrics include odometer readings and mileages, battery state-of-charge, energy usage by subsystem, overall energy efficiency, route geolocation, and environmental impact. Charging voltages, power, energy delivered, and session start and stop times are also available. Real-time fault and status alert capabilities provide user notifications through email and text message. The telematics platform also provides charge management capability enabling optimization of power levels and energy costs based on bus arrival and departure schedules. The telematics platform can enable over-the-air updates, and over time we expect to expand its functionality to include further charge management capabilities which is expected to enable customers to minimize demand charges and further reduce energy costs. The Valence platform is designed to be flexible and can also be configured for use with other commercial electric vehicles.
Our Technology
 Our technology platform supports our broad portfolio of products and services across the electrification ecosystem designed to overcome the most significant obstacles to commercial vehicle electrification. The primary features of our electric vehicle technology platform, designed to meet the unique requirements of commercial fleet electrification and differentiate it from the competition, include:
•Integrated technology solutions spanning the electrification ecosystem.    Our proprietary commercial electric vehicle platform is centered on our Proterra Powered battery and electric drivetrain technology, is complemented by our Proterra Energy fleet-scale, high-power charging infrastructure solutions, and enhanced by our Valence fleet and energy management software-as-a-service platform, which is designed to enable customers to manage their vehicles and charging operations in real-time, reducing the total cost of ownership. Proterra Transit offers real-world validation, testing, and a positive feedback loop for our technology platform. 
•Modular and flexible battery platform.    We offer a modular battery platform available in different form factors, which can be produced on the same manufacturing line, to satisfy the specific needs of our customers and the design constraints of their vehicles. Commercial vehicles are not homogenous and span a wide range of weight classes (from Class 3 over 10,000 pounds to Class 8 over 33,000 pounds), chassis sizes, and frame rail lengths. We believe offering compatibility with as many different vehicle segments as possible without requiring equipment retooling or manufacturing customization is key to achieving higher market penetration. Enabled by the simplicity of design and integrated architecture of our battery modules, our battery packs are available in two widths and heights to accommodate different frame rails, various lengths ranging from 3-feet to 9-feet, and four different voltages which can be strung together in up to 16 parallel strings, with voltages as high as 1,200V. The modularity and manufacturability of our batteries enable us to provide solutions for a wide variety of commercial vehicle sizes and segments, ranging from as low as 35 kWh systems for commercial vans and shuttles up to 1 megawatt-hour (“MWh”) or more for long haul trucks and heavy-duty equipment.
•Highly efficient design enabling exceptional energy density and range.    Our battery systems are structurally designed to optimize energy density, safety, and cost. We achieve this through a highly efficient design in which the cooling mechanisms, module structure, and pack structure are all the same element, reducing space, weight and cost. The high energy density of our battery systems increases vehicle efficiency, extends range and allows higher occupant or cargo capacity. Our focus on efficiency extends to our drivetrains, which we have designed to optimize torque and efficiency through the use of multi-speed transmissions to meet the demands of the most rigorous and diverse routes for commercial vehicles. As a result, relative to diesel’s low fuel efficiency of less than 5 miles per gallon, our electric vehicles can exceed 20 miles per gallon equivalent, generating significant cost savings. By implementing these efficient designs, maintenance costs can also be materially reduced given fewer moving parts, no need for oil changes, and less frequent brake replacements due to regenerative braking systems.
•Designed and certified for safety.    Safety is a top priority in our battery design. In addition to offering higher energy density than typical electric passenger vehicle batteries, our commercial-grade batteries offer a high degree of safety and durability due in large part to two core design attributes: cooling and structural rigidity. Through the use of both active cooling and passive propagation resistance in module and pack construction, we have designed our batteries to achieve a lifespan required for commercial 
Table of Contents

vehicle use while operating under daily charge/discharge cycles and to maintain safe and reliable operation. Our battery systems incorporate hundreds of sensors that continuously monitor the active and passive safety systems with multiple layers of redundancy. In addition, we designed our battery packs to be structurally robust, providing protection against strenuous duty cycles and high impact incidents. Our battery systems have been certified by Underwriter Laboratories to be compliant to ISO 26262, which represents today’s state-of-the-art for functional safety for road vehicles. We have also received ECE-R100 certification required to deliver certain product to our European customers. These certifications can provide us a competitive advantage, especially in markets where the certification is a prerequisite to sell electric vehicles and with vehicle OEMs that have their own standards for component safety.

Supply chain
We have developed close relationships with several key suppliers, particularly for lithium-ion cells, drivetrain components, charging systems, and bus bodies. Our bus bodies are purchased from TPI Composites, Inc. While we obtain some components from multiple sources, in some cases we also purchase significant components used in our products from a single source that we have validated. For our battery cells, we have two qualified suppliers for supply chain resiliency but have only used one of these suppliers, LG Energy Solution, for our current battery system to date. We also operate a cell testing lab where we regularly empirically evaluate the performance and reliability of new cells and cell chemistries from a wide range of global cell manufacturers.
We obtain systems, components, raw materials, parts, manufacturing equipment, and other supplies from suppliers that we believe to be reputable and reliable. We have established and follow internal quality control processes to source suppliers, considering engineering validation, quality, cost, delivery, and lead-time. We have a quality management team that is responsible for managing and ensuring that supplied components meet quality standards. Our quality standards are guided by industry standards, including Automotive Industry Action Group, Advanced Product Quality Planning, and Production Part Approval Process procedures, which were developed by the U.S. auto industry.
Our electric transit buses use purchased parts that are primarily sourced from American suppliers. We developed our supply chain to comply with the Federal Transit Administration’s (“FTA”) Buy America requirements and the Federal Aviation Administration’s (“FAA”) Buy American requirements, which govern transit bus procurements that are paid for, in part, with federal funds by transit agencies and airports, respectively. For certain Canadian customers, we source select vehicle content from Canadian suppliers in order to comply with Canadian Content requirements.
Manufacturing
We have battery manufacturing facilities in City of Industry and Burlingame, California, and Powered 1 battery factory at Greer, South Carolina, which started production in January 2023.

Our services typically include training for operators and technicians, onsite delivery support, field support, engineering escalation support, and procurement of spare parts. By performing vehicle services ourselves, we can efficiently identify problems, find solutions, and incorporate improvements into our products.
We design our charging systems and buses with the capability to connect to our telematics platform. We use this data to inform product development and assist with service calls. We are constantly evaluating our service offerings to make sure we are properly aligned with our customers’ needs.
Warranty
We offer warranties for our battery systems, electric transit buses, including their major subsystems, and charging systems.
Our battery system warranty is dependent on the vehicle and its usage. We offer 6-year standard warranty and 12-year extended warranty on the battery for materials and workmanship, and an energy capacity warranty that depends on vehicle capacity and expected usage. We typically offer two to five-year warranties on other ancillary components of our powertrain system. Our standard warranty on battery systems reserves the right to replace components with different items of equal or better performance to keep pace with improvements in battery technology development.
Our electric transit bus warranty is comprised of a one-year complete bus warranty, a 12-year warranty on our composite bus body, and warranties on other components generally ranging from one to three years. Transit agencies will often request additional coverage as part of the initial capital purchase, in part to minimize their operational costs. We price these extended warranties into our contract bids.
Under the fleet defect provisions included in some electric transit bus purchase contracts, we are required to proactively prevent re-occurrences of a defect in the entire fleet of electric transit buses delivered under a contract if the same defect occurs in more than a specified percentage of the fleet within the base warranty period (or sometimes base warranty period plus one year) following delivery of the electric transit bus.
We offer a standard two-year warranty on our charging hardware. Warranties for installed third party hardware can extend up to five years. When we have offered extended warranty coverage beyond the suppliers’ warranty, we have priced these extended warranties into our contract bid.

Government regulations, funding, and other programs
Regulations and programs
Battery safety and testing
Our battery system complies with all requirements of the SAE J2929 Safety Standard for Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Propulsion Battery Systems Utilizing Lithium-based Rechargeable Cells. In addition, we test our battery systems according to industry standards, including from the SAE, the Economic Commission for Europe (“ECE”), and Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”), as well as our own internal standards, for conditions, including mechanical abuse, thermal cycling, humidity, water immersion, corrosion, and short circuit events. We have also completed applicable transportation tests for our battery packs, demonstrating our compliance with applicable regulations that govern the transport of lithium-ion batteries.
Certain materials in our battery packs contain trace amounts of hazardous chemicals, whose use, storage, and disposal are regulated under federal and state law. In addition, we are subject to international regulatory and safety requirements, including the European Union’s directives related to hazardous substances such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) and the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”). Most of our battery systems are recyclable, which enables us to develop battery recycling programs with third parties to recycle our battery packs at the end of their useful life.
Model bus testing program
The FTA mandates that new transit bus models, and subsequent material changes to those models, be physically tested to meet certain performance standards in order to be eligible to receive federal transit funding. Altoona Testing is designed to promote production of better transit vehicles and components, and to ensure that transit customers purchase vehicles that are able to withstand the rigors of transit service. Altoona Testing, typically a required pre-condition for customer acceptances, is available to vendors on a first-come, first-served basis and subject to a waiting list. To date, our 40-foot and 35-foot buses have completed Altoona Testing, but as material changes are made to our bus platform, we must undergo new rounds of testing.
The vehicles we sell in Canada are subject to different safety testing regulations and may require redesign or additional testing.
Zero Emission Certifications
In addition, we are subject to the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and California Air Resources Board’s (“CARB”) annual certification greenhouse gas emissions requirements related to our transit vehicle and powertrain. The CARB certification is required to participate in California’s Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (“HVIP”), which offers vouchers to our customers to reduce the purchase price of zero-emission vehicles. 
Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
The United States NHTSA mandates that vehicles, including transit buses, meet all the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) testing requirements issued by the agency. We self-certify that our electric transit buses comply with applicable FMVSS as of the date of vehicle production. Our electric transit buses must also conform to state and local requirements which vary by jurisdiction. Transit buses sold in Canada must also meet Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“CMVSS”). Transport Canada monitors FMVSS for applicability to Canada to further align with U.S. regulations, adopting or modifying an FMVSS to address unique usage and environmental conditions in the Canadian market.

Government funding opportunities
Federal funding programs for zero-emission commercial vehicles
On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed the Infrastructure and Investment Jobs Act, also referred to as the “Bipartisan Infrastructure Law”, into law. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law created a number of new funding opportunities for Proterra Powered & Energy customers. The EPA will receive $5 billion over 5 years for the Clean School Bus program, which provides $500 million per year for zero emission school buses, as well an additional $500 million per year for low or zero emission school buses. The EPA also continues to administer the Diesel Emission Reduction Act grant program, which provides funding for transit, school bus, drayage, refuse, and other vehicle types that are low or zero emission. Finally, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also provides funding through discretionary and formula programs to various departments at the US Department of Transportation and, can potentially fund opportunities to electrify commercial vehicles at airports, ports, and other locations.
In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, adding additional funding and tax credit programs for commercial vehicles, including a commercial clean vehicle credit, a number of which are expected to become available to recipients in 2023.
Federal formula and competitive funding programs for transit customers 
Our transit customers are generally transit authorities who depend on federal government funding and programs authorized for public transportation under Title 49, Chapter 53 of the United States Code, and administered by the FTA, as well as other state funding programs. Federal and state funding has accelerated the adoption of electric vehicles in this market. Our principal customers are eligible for government funding, including, in particular, programs authorized under the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, to accelerate their investments in electric transit fleets. Passed in December 2015, the FAST Act allocated over $305 billion for highway, transit, and vehicle safety programs for a five-year period ending September 30, 2020. The FAST Act was subsequently extended and then reauthorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law through the federal government’s fiscal year 2026.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides approximately $567 billion to discretionary and formula programs under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (“USDOT”) jurisdiction, including approximately $39 billion of funding to transit, which represents an increase of 43% compared to amounts authorized under the FAST Act. Among other programs, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law authorized a supplemental appropriation of $5.25 billion over five years for the Low or No Emission Program. Although 25% of this funding is reserved for low-emission buses only, it will provide over $850 million per year for funding zero-emission transit buses and infrastructure, a 14-fold increase over the authorized amounts in the FAST Act. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also funds the Buses and Bus Facilities competitive program at $376 million in 2022 to $412 million in 2026. 
State funding programs
Certain states offer vouchers and other incentives for clean energy vehicles. California offers HVIP, which provides a point-of-sale discount to organizations that purchase fleets of hybrid and electric trucks and buses. The HVIP vouchers are targeted to offset about 80% of the incremental cost of hybrid and electric trucks and buses. In 2021, the state of California passed a historic zero-emission vehicle and infrastructure funding package for fiscal year 2021-2022, which includes $269.5 million for the HVIP program as well as $130 million set aside for HVIP for school buses, $70 million set aside for transit vehicles, and $75 million for HVIP for drayage trucks. California also offers vouchers for clean off-road equipment (“CORE”), such as cargo handling equipment. California’s FY2021-2022 budget includes $194.95 million for CORE vouchers. California’s zero-emission vehicle and infrastructure funding package for fiscal year 2021-2022 also provided for $873 million in funding for clean heavy-duty vehicles and off-road equipment in fiscal year 2021-2022 (to be implemented by the California Air Resources Board) and $391 million in funding for medium- and heavy-duty ZEV infrastructure in fiscal year 2021-2022 (to be implemented by the California Energy Commission).
New York offers the Truck Voucher Incentive Program, which funds low- and zero-emission transit buses and other vehicles. Other states offer similar programs that provide point-of-sale discounts to purchasers of electric vehicles, which help our customers offset the costs of purchasing our transit vehicles. To be eligible vehicles, our

electric transit buses must meet certification requirements for electric vehicles from the EPA and, where applicable, California Air Resources Board. Additionally, there are other state programs that help fund electric bus purchases. For example, states are allocating portions of settlement funds from the approximately $15 billion Volkswagen Emissions Settlement Program to investments in zero-emission transit buses, and the state of California has allocated about 10% of its annual Cap-and-Trade funds to California’s Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program.
State emissions credits
Public transit agencies and other customers may be eligible for emission reduction credits through state programs.
The California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (“LCFS”) enables transit agencies using electricity as a source of fuel to opt into the LCFS program and earn credits that can be monetized. While the value of these credits fluctuates, the credits may help to offset up to half of the fuel costs for our transit customers.
Intellectual property
The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We rely upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention or work product assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to, and clarify ownership of, our proprietary information.
As of December 31, 2022, we held 77 issued U.S. patents and had 25 U.S. patent applications pending. We also held 31 issued patents and 30 patent applications pending in a foreign jurisdiction. Our U.S. issued patents expire between 2029 and 2040. As of December 31, 2022, we held 8 registered trademarks in the United States, including the Proterra mark, and also held 14 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology.
Human Capital Management
We believe that our talented workforce and our mission driven company culture are competitive advantages and we have taken steps to strengthen our culture and focus on workforce development and engagement as we have grown. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 1,247 full-time equivalent employees. In January 2023, we announced a reduction of approximately 25% of our workforce across multiple locations and closure of our City of Industry facility where we manufacture transit buses and battery systems. We continue to hire new employees based on business needs. Our production employees in City of Industry are represented by the United Steel Paper & Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied & Industrial Service Workers International Union AFL-CIO, CLC and we have a collective bargaining agreement with the union that will terminate with the wind down of the City of Industry facility. We do not have collective bargaining agreements in any of our other facilities. 
In 2022, we focused on our culture by engaging our employees and leadership through surveys, focus group meetings, cross functional working sessions, and establishing an employee task force to work with external consultants to refine and communicate our shared values of innovation, adaptability, continuous improvement, teamwork & collaboration, inclusion, kindness, and sustainability. We also hired our first Chief People Officer in October 2022.
