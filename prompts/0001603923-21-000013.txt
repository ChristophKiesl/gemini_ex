Item 1. Business

Weatherford International plc, an Irish public limited company, together with its subsidiaries (“Weatherford,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”), is a multinational oilfield service company. We are a leading wellbore and production solution company providing equipment and services used in the drilling, evaluation, completion, production and intervention of oil and natural gas wells. We were originally incorporated in Delaware in 1972, and are currently incorporated in Ireland. Many of our businesses, including those of our predecessor companies, have been operating for more than 50 years.

We conduct operations in over 75 countries, answering the challenges of the energy industry with approximately 390 operating locations including manufacturing, research and development, service, and training facilities. Our operational performance is reviewed on a geographic basis and we report our Western Hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere as separate and distinct reporting segments.
 Our principal executive offices are located at 2000 St. James Place, Houston, Texas 77056 and our telephone number at that location is +1.713.836.4000. Our internet address is www.weatherford.com. General information about us, including our corporate governance policies, code of business conduct and charters for the committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website. On our website we make available, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish them to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC maintains a website that contains our reports, proxy and information statements, and our other SEC filings. The address of that site is www.sec.gov. 
On April 17, 2020, the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) filed a Form 25 with the SEC. The delisting of our ordinary shares from the NYSE became effective on April 27, 2020, and our ordinary shares were subsequently deregistered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act on July 16, 2020. We continue to evaluate listing options and intend to relist our ordinary shares when our Board of Directors determines market conditions are appropriate. Until such time as our ordinary shares are relisted, the Company intends to continue filing periodic reports with the SEC on a voluntary basis. Our ordinary shares trade on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the ticker symbol “WFTLF”.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic, travel constraints and access restrictions to customer work locations continue to cause significant uncertainty for the global economy, resulting in the continued significant decline in the global demand for oil and gas and related customer activity shutdowns. This continues to cause an imbalance in the supply and demand for oil and gas. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic together with uncertainty around the extent and timing for an economic recovery, have caused significant market volatility of commodity prices in the first half of 2020 and resulted in significant reductions to the capital spending during 2020 of our primary customer base which consists of exploration and production companies, with lowering expectations of oil and gas related spending into 2021 and beyond. In addition, the risk of additional COVID-19 related restrictions or lockdowns remains, which creates further uncertainty in the global economic outlook and impact on oil and gas markets.
We continue to closely monitor the global impacts surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, including operational and manufacturing disruptions, logistical constraints and travel restrictions. These factors have negatively impacted our ability to operate and we expect these negative impacts to continue. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience delays or a lack of availability of key components from our suppliers, shipping and other logistical delays and disruptions, customer restrictions that prevent access to their sites, community measures to contain the spread of the virus, and changes to Weatherford’s policies that have both restricted and changed the way our employees work. We expect most, if not all, of these disruptions and constraints to have lasting effects on how we and our customers and suppliers work in the future. 
Faced with these challenges, we have evolved our digital portfolio and enhanced our applications to offer fully-integrated digital oilfield solutions. We have also increased our offerings of automated well construction and remote monitoring and predictive analytics related to our production offerings. Finally, we continuously improve crew rotations and management practices to minimize our employees’ exposure to COVID-19. Our identification and management of COVID-19 cases continues to improve, through updated protocols, advanced testing and response procedures.

Reorganization and Emergence from Bankruptcy Proceedings
On July 1, 2019 (the “Petition Date”), Weatherford and two of our subsidiaries (collectively, the “Weatherford Parties”) commenced voluntary reorganization proceedings (the “Cases”), including under Chapter 11 of Title 11 (“Chapter 11”) of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”), with ancillary proceedings filed in Ireland and Bermuda. The plan of reorganization (as amended, the “Plan”), together with the schemes of arrangement in Ireland and Bermuda, became effective on December 13, 2019 (the “Effective Date”) and the Weatherford Parties emerged from Chapter 11.
On the Effective Date, the Weatherford Parties’ then-existing unsecured senior and exchangeable senior notes totaling $7.6 billion were cancelled pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Upon emergence from Chapter 11, on the Effective Date, we adopted and applied the relevant guidance with respect to the accounting and financial reporting for entities that have emerged from bankruptcy proceedings (“Fresh Start Accounting”). For additional details regarding the Chapter 11, see “Note 2 – Emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Proceedings” and for Fresh Start Accounting see “Note 3 – Fresh Start Accounting”.
Under Fresh Start Accounting, our balance sheet on the Effective Date reflected all our assets and liabilities at fair value. As described in “Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” references to “Predecessor” relate to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period from January 1, 2019 through and including the adjustments from the application of Fresh Start Accounting on December 13, 2019 and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and (“Predecessor Periods”). References to “Successor” relate to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the period from December 14, 2019 through December 31, 2019 (“Successor Periods”). 
References and comparisons to results for the year ended December 31, 2019 relate to the combined Successor and Predecessor Periods for the year ended December 31, 2019 (“2019 Combined Period”) as the 18 days of the Successor Period is not a significant period of time impacting the combined 2019 results.
Strategy

Our primary objective is to build value through profitable growth in our core product lines with disciplined use of capital and a strong customer focus.
Our customers’ objectives are continually evolving and are currently focused on lowering capital and operational expenditures, generating positive cash flow, reducing emissions, and enhancing safety. Weatherford has aligned its technology development and operations around these trends and expanding its role as a market leading solutions provider that assists our customers in addressing their key operational challenges related to four domains:
•Mature Fields: rejuvenating aging assets from the reservoir to the point of sale through optimizing lift efficiency, restoring wellbore efficiency and integrity, accelerating reservoir recovery, and permanently abandoning wells when they are no longer economic to produce;
•Unconventionals: enabling customers to solve reservoir challenges and maximize production by drilling faster, deeper, safer and cheaper and combating production declines through accurate reservoir evaluation, efficient well construction, effective stimulation, and optimizing production;
•Offshore: supporting customers sustain high-margin, long-term production with a focus on reducing rig time, enhancing safety and reliability, and increasing well integrity through the optimization of well placement and construction;
•Digitalization and Automation: leveraging our core competencies and significant presence at well sites to capture, analyze and present information for our customers by leveraging the internet of things, data analytics, and cloud computing across our many solutions.
    We have enabled this solution-based focus across our organization through a commitment to improving safety and service quality, embedding a returns-focused mindset in our organization, and developing and commercializing new technologies.

Markets

We are a leading global wellbore and production solutions company providing equipment and services to the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. Demand for our industry’s services and products depends in part upon commodity prices for oil and gas, the number of oil and natural gas wells drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of wells, the number of well completions, the depletion and age of existing wells and the level of workover activity worldwide.
Technology is critical to the oil and natural gas marketplace as a result of the maturity of the world’s oil and natural gas reservoirs, the acceleration of production decline rates and the focus on complex well designs, including deepwater prospects. Customers continue to seek, test and use production-enabling technologies at an increasing rate. We invested substantial resources into building our technology offerings, which helps us to provide our customers with more efficient tools to find and produce oil and natural gas. Our products and services enable our customers to reduce their costs of drilling and production, increase production rates, or both. Furthermore, these technology offerings afford us additional opportunities to sell our core products and services to our customers.
Reporting Segments
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (the Chief Executive Officer) regularly reviews the information of our two reportable segments which are our Western Hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere. These reportable segments are based on management’s organization and view of Weatherford’s business when making operating decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance. Research and development expenses are included in the results of both our Western and Eastern Hemisphere segments. Our corporate and other expenses that do not individually meet the criteria for segment reporting are reported separately under the caption Corporate General and Administrative in our Segment Information disclosures. 
Products and Services
Our principal business is to provide equipment and services to the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, both onshore and offshore. During the second quarter of 2020, in order to support the streamlining and realignment of the business, we combined our prior reported four product lines into two product lines. Our two product lines are: (1) Completion and Production and (2) Drilling, Evaluation and Intervention. Our new combined Completion and Production product line was previously reported as two separate product lines. Our new Drilling, Evaluation and Intervention product line was previously reported as two separate product lines of (i) Drilling and Evaluation, and (ii) Well Construction.
Completion and Production offers production optimization services and a complete production ecosystem, featuring our artificial-lift portfolio, testing and flow-measurement solutions, and optimization software to boost productivity and profitability. In addition, we have a suite of modern completion products, reservoir stimulation designs, and engineering capabilities that isolate zones and unlock reserves in deepwater, unconventional, and aging reservoirs. The following is a detailed description of our product and service offerings under our Completion and Production product line.
Artificial Lift Systems provides a mechanical method to produce oil or gas from a well lacking sufficient reservoir pressure for natural flow. We provide most forms of lift, including reciprocating rod lift systems, progressing cavity pumping, gas-lift systems, hydraulic-lift systems, plunger-lift systems and hybrid lift systems for special applications. We also offer related automation and control systems.

The service line offers a comprehensive liner-hanger portfolio, along with engineering and executional experience, for a wide range of applications that include high-temperature and high-pressure wells.
Cementing Products enables operators to centralize the casing throughout the wellbore and control the displacement of cement and other fluids for proper zonal isolation. Specialized equipment includes plugs, float and stage equipment and torque-and-drag reduction technology. Our cementing engineers analyze complex wells and provide all job requirements from pre-job planning to installation.
Drilling, Evaluation and Intervention comprises a suite of services ranging from early well planning to reservoir management. The drilling services offer innovative tools and expert engineering to increase efficiency and maximize reservoir exposure. The evaluation services merge wellsite capabilities including wireline and managed pressure drilling. We also build or rebuild well integrity for the full life cycle of the well. Using conventional to advanced equipment, we offer safe and efficient tubular running services in any environment. Our skilled fishing and re-entry teams execute under any contingency from drilling to abandonment, and our drilling tools provide reliable pressure control even in extreme wellbores. The following is a detailed description of our product and service offerings currently provided by our Drilling, Evaluation and Intervention product line.
Drilling Services includes directional drilling, logging while drilling, measurement while drilling and rotary-steerable systems. This service line also includes our full range of downhole equipment, including high-temperature and high-pressure sensors, drilling reamers and circulation subs.
Managed Pressure Drilling helps to manage wellbore pressures to optimize drilling performance. The services incorporate various technologies, including rotating control devices and advanced automated control systems, as well as, several drilling techniques, such as closed-loop drilling, air drilling, managed-pressure drilling and underbalanced drilling.
Wireline Services includes open-hole and cased-hole logging services that measure the physical properties of underground formations to determine production potential, locate resources and detect cement and casing integrity issues. The service line also executes well intervention and remediation operations by conveying equipment via cable into oil and natural gas wells.
Tubular Running Services provides equipment, tubular handling, tubular management and tubular connection services for the drilling, completions and workover of oil or natural gas wells. The services include conventional rig services, automated rig systems, real-time torque-monitoring and remote viewing of the makeup and breakout verification process. In addition, they include drilling-with-casing services.
Intervention Services provides re-entry, fishing, wellbore cleaning and well abandonment services, as well as, advanced multilateral well systems.
Drilling Tools and Rental Equipment delivers our patented tools and equipment, including drillpipe and collars, bottom hole assembly tools, tubular-handling equipment, pressure-control equipment, and machine-shop services, for drilling oil and natural gas wells. 
Other Business Data

Competition
We provide our products and services worldwide and compete in a variety of distinct segments with a number of competitors. Our principal competitors include Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, National Oilwell Varco, Nabors Industries, ChampionX Corporation and Frank’s International. We also compete with various other regional suppliers that provide a limited range of equipment and services tailored for local markets. Competition is based on a number of factors, including performance, safety, quality, reliability, service, price, response time and, in some cases, depth and breadth of products. The oilfield services business is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed. Additionally, the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of our competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business as a result.

Raw Materials

We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, as well as, parts and components made by other manufacturers and suppliers for use in our manufacturing facilities. Many of the products or components of products sold by us are manufactured by other parties. We are not dependent in any material respect on any single supplier for our raw materials or purchased components.
Customers

Substantially all of our customers are engaged in the energy industry. Most of our international sales are to large international or national oil companies and North America sales are to independent oil companies. As of December 31, 2020, the Eastern and Western Hemisphere accounted for 54% and 46%, respectively, of our total net outstanding accounts receivable from customers balance. As of December 31, 2020, customer receivables in Mexico and the U.S. accounted for 23% and 12%, respectively, of our total net outstanding accounts receivables from customers. No other country accounted for more than 10% of our net outstanding accounts receivables balance. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues.
Backlog 
Our services are usually short-term, day-rate based and cancellable should our customers wish to alter the scope of work. Consequently, our backlog of firm orders is not material to our business.
Research, Development and Patents 
We maintain world-class technology and training centers throughout the world. Additionally, we have research, development and engineering facilities that are focused on improving existing products and services and developing new technologies to meet customer demands for improved drilling performance and enhanced reservoir productivity. Weatherford has significant expertise, trade secrets, intellectual property and know-how with respect to manufacturing equipment and providing services. As many areas of our business rely on patents and proprietary technology, we seek and ensure patent protection both inside and outside the U.S. for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. Although in the aggregate our patents are important to the manufacturing and marketing of many of our products and services, we do not believe that the expiration of any one of our patents would have a materially adverse effect on our business. 
With respect to the Successor, we amortize developed technology over 5 years. With respect to the Predecessor, we amortized patents over the years that we expected to benefit from their existence, which typically extended from the grant of the patent through and until 20 years after the filing date of the patent application. 
Seasonality
The widespread geographical locations of our operations serve to mitigate the overall impact of the seasonal nature of our business in certain geographic regions. Weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the level of demand for our products and services. Spring months in Canada and winter months in the North Sea and Russia can affect our operations negatively. Additionally, heavy rains, hurricanes or an exceedingly cold winter in a given region or other climate changes may impact our results. Unpredictable or unusually harsh weather conditions could lengthen the periods of reduced activity and have a detrimental impact to our results of operations. In addition, customer spending patterns for our products and services may result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as our customers seek to fully utilize their annual budgets. Conversely, customer budget constraints may lead to lower demand for our services and products in the fourth quarter of each year.
Federal Regulation and Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally relating to the energy industry in general and the environment in particular. Our 2020 expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations were not material, and we currently do not expect the cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations for 2021 to be material.
Weatherford International plc – 2020 Form 10-K | 6



We have obligations and expect to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures, as a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Among those obligations, are the current requirements imposed by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) at the former Universal Compression facility in Midland, Texas. At this location we are performing a TCEQ-approved Remedial Action Plan (“RAP”) to address contaminated ground water. The performance of the RAP and related expenses are scheduled to be performed over a ten to twenty-year period and, may cost as much as $6 million, all of which is recorded as an undiscounted obligation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020. We continuously monitor and strive to maintain compliance with changes in laws and regulations that impact our business.

We are committed to maintaining and fostering a culture grounded in the principles inherent in pay-for-performance over the short and long-term for our employees eligible to receive a bonus. Through this culture, we strive to attract, motivate, retain and reward our employees for their work that contributes to building our brand and to sustaining our success in the marketplace. We believe our culture of aligning our strategic priorities with our compensation programs supports a cohesive drive towards value creation for all our stakeholders.
Diversity & Inclusion
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable bringing their true selves to work. It is important that we operate in a collaborative and inclusive manner across all levels of our organization, embracing gender, racial and ethnic diversity among our employees and recognizing the strength and competitive advantages that 
Weatherford International plc – 2020 Form 10-K | 7



our differences afford us as an individual and a company. Our Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”) Program promotes partnerships, engagement, and collaboration across our organization.
Our D&I Executive Council, which includes our executive leadership team and other senior leaders, provides strategic direction and oversight of the D&I Program. In addition, we have a Global D&I Advisory Board with global employee representation. Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) based on the needs and requests of our employees seek to align activities to enrich our culture and drive D&I initiatives at the local level that engage, educate and empower our workforce while having a positive impact on our business.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we rolled out “Avoiding Unconscious Bias eLearning” as a global training course for employees and managers, and we conducted an interactive virtual session on Inclusive Leadership.
Employee Statistics
As of December 31, 2020, Weatherford had approximately 17,200 employees globally, located in 75 different countries. In response to the price of crude oil and a lower level of exploration and production spending, in addition to other overall cost reductions, we reduced our workforce by 28% and 35% from our workforce totals at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Certain of our operations are subject to union contracts and these contracts cover approximately 17% of our employees.
