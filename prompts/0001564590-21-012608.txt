Overview 
 Party City Holdco is a Delaware corporation formed in 2012. It has no operating assets or operations. Party City Holdco owns 100% of PC Nextco Holdings, LLC (“PC Nextco”), which owns 100% of PC Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (“PC Intermediate”). PC Intermediate owns 100% of Party City Holdings Inc. (“PCHI”). PCHI or its direct or indirect subsidiaries conduct most of our operations. The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 80 Grasslands Road, Elmsford, New York 10523. 
 We are the leading party goods company by revenue in North America and, we believe, the largest vertically integrated supplier of decorated party goods globally by revenue. The Company is a popular one-stop shopping destination for party supplies, balloons, and costumes. In addition to being a great retail brand, the Company is a global, world-class organization that combines state-of-the-art manufacturing and sourcing operations, and sophisticated wholesale operations complemented by a multi-channel retailing strategy and e-commerce retail operations. The Company is a leading player in its category and vertically integrated in its breadth and depth. The Company designs, manufactures, sources and distributes party goods, including paper and plastic tableware, metallic and latex balloons, Halloween and other costumes, accessories, novelties, gifts and stationery throughout the world. The Company’s retail operations include 831 specialty retail party supply stores (including franchise stores) throughout the United States and Mexico operating under the names Party City and Halloween City, and e-commerce websites, including through the domain name PartyCity.com.

In addition to our retail operations, we are also one of the largest global designers, manufacturers and distributors of decorated consumer party products, with items found in retail outlets worldwide, including independent party supply stores, mass merchants, grocery retailers, e-commerce merchandisers and dollar stores. Our products are available or licensed in over 100 countries with the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Canada, Germany, Mexico and Australia among the largest end markets for our products outside of the United States.
Industry Overview 
 We operate in the broadly defined retail party goods industry and Halloween market. The party goods industry includes decorative paper and plastic tableware, costumes, decorations, accessories and balloons, all of which are supported by a range of suppliers from commodity paper goods producers to party goods manufacturers. The retail landscape for decorated party goods is comprised primarily of party superstores, mass merchants, e-commerce merchandisers, craft stores, grocery retailers, and dollar stores. Sales of party goods are fueled by everyday events such as birthdays, baby showers, weddings and anniversaries, as well as seasonal events such as holidays and other special occasions. 
Segments 
 We have two reporting segments: Retail and Wholesale. In 2020, we generated 74.5% of our total revenues from our retail segment and 25.5% of our total revenues from our wholesale segment. 
 Our retail operations generate revenue primarily through the sale of our party supplies, which are sold under the Amscan and Anagram brand names, through our Party City stores, Halloween City stores and PartyCity.com. 
 Our wholesale revenues are generated from the sale of decorated party goods for all occasions, including paper and plastic tableware, accessories and novelties, costumes, metallic and latex balloons and stationery. Our products are sold at wholesale to party goods superstores (including our franchise stores), other party goods retailers, mass merchants, independent card and gift stores, dollar stores and e-commerce merchandisers. 
 Financial information about our industry segments and geographic segments is provided in Note 19, Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Retail Operations 
 Overview 
 After opening its first company-owned store in 1986, Party City has grown to become what we believe is the largest operator of owned and franchised party superstores by revenue in the United States. Our websites, including PartyCity.com, offer a convenient, user-friendly and secure online shopping option for our customers. In addition to the ability to order products, our websites provide a substantial amount of content about our party products, party planning ideas and promotional offers. The websites are also one of our key marketing vehicles, specifically as they relate to social media marketing initiatives. We have franchised stores throughout the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico run by franchisees utilizing our format, design specifications, methods, standards, operating procedures, systems and trademarks. Our wholesale sales to franchised stores generally mirror, with respect to relative size, mix and category, those to our company-owned stores. We are not currently marketing, nor do we plan to market, new franchise territories in the United States. 
 The following table shows the change in our company-owned Party City store network over the past three years:

We receive revenue from our franchisees, consisting of an initial one-time fee and ongoing royalty fees generally ranging from 4% to 6% of net sales. In exchange for these franchise fees, franchisees principally receive brand value and company support with respect to planograms. Each franchisee has a mandated advertising budget, which consists of a minimum initial store opening promotion and ongoing local advertising and promotions. Additionally, franchisees must pay 1% to 2.25% of net sales to a group advertising fund to cover common advertising materials. Our franchise agreements provide us with a right of first refusal should any franchisee look to dispose of its operations. 
 Current franchise agreements provide for an assigned area or territory that typically equals a three or four-mile radius from the franchisee’s store location and the right to use the Party City® logo and trademark. In addition, certain agreements with our franchisees and other business partners contain geographic limitations on opening new stores. For most stores, the franchisee or the majority owner of a corporate franchisee devotes full time to the management, operation and on-premises supervision of the stores or groups of stores. 
 Retail Seasonality
 Our retail operations are subject to significant seasonal variations. Historically, this segment has realized a significant portion of its revenues, cash flow and net income in the fourth quarter of the year, principally due to our Halloween sales in October and, to a lesser extent, year-end holiday sales. Halloween business represents approximately 20% of our total domestic retail sales. To maximize our seasonal opportunity, we operate a chain of temporary Halloween stores, under the Halloween City banner, during the months of September and October of each year.

Wholesale Operations 
 Overview 
 We currently offer over 400 party goods ensembles, which range from approximately five to 50 design-coordinated items spanning tableware, accessories, novelties, balloons and decorations. The breadth of these ensembles enables our retail stores and third – party retailers to promote additional sales of related products for every occasion. To enhance our customers’ celebrations of life’s important events, we market party goods ensembles for a wide variety of occasions, including seasonal and religious holidays, special events and themed celebrations. Our Amscan and Anagram branded products are offered in retail outlets worldwide, ranging from party goods superstores (including our franchise stores), other party goods retailers, mass merchants, independent card and gift stores, dollar stores and e-commerce merchandisers. We have long-term relationships with many of our wholesale customers. 
 The table below shows the breakdown of our total wholesale sales by channel for the year ended December 31, 2020: 
 
 
Channel | Sales | 
----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+----
 | (dollars in millions) | 
Owned stores and e-commerce | $ | 472
Party City franchised stores and other domestic retailers | | 174
Domestic balloon distributors/retailers | | 73 
International balloon distributors | | 20 
Other international | | 201
Total wholesale sales | $ | 940

Wholesale Manufactured Products 
 We manufacture items representing approximately 43% of our net sales at wholesale (including sales to our retail operations). Generally, our manufacturing facilities are highly automated and produce paper and plastic plates and cups, paper napkins, metallic and latex balloons, injection molded product, costumes, pinatas and other party and novelty items at globally competitive costs. State-of-the-art printing, forming, folding and packaging equipment support most of these manufacturing operations. Given our size and sales volume, we are generally able to operate our manufacturing equipment on the basis of at least two shifts per day, thus lowering production costs per unit. In select cases, we use available capacity to manufacture products for third parties, which allows us to maintain a satisfactory level of equipment utilization. 
 The company’s facilities and the products produced at each location is listed in Item 2. “Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Complementing our manufacturing facilities, we have a diverse global network of third-party suppliers that supports our strategy of consistently offering a broad selection of high quality, innovative and competitively priced product. We have relationships that exceed twenty years with many of our vendors and often represent a significant portion of their overall business. They generally produce items designed by and created for us, are located in Asia, and are managed by our sourcing office in Hong Kong. We actively work with our third-party suppliers to ensure product cost, quality and safety. 
 The principal raw materials used in manufacturing our products are paper, petroleum-based resin and cotton. While we currently purchase such raw material from a relatively small number of sources, paper, resin and cotton are available from numerous sources. Therefore, we believe our current suppliers could be replaced without adversely affecting our manufacturing operations in any material respect. 
 Wholesale Product Safety and Quality Assurance 
 We are subject to regulatory requirements in the United States and internationally, and we believe that all products that we manufacture and source comply with the requirements in the markets in which they are sold. Third-party manufactured products are tested both at the manufacturing site and upon arrival at our distribution centers. We have a full-time staff of professionals in the United States, Asia and Europe dedicated to product safety and quality assurance.

Wholesale Distribution and Systems 
 We ship our products directly to retailers and distributors throughout the world from our distribution facilities, as well as directly from our domestic and international factories. Our electronic order entry and information systems allow us to manage our inventory. 
 Our main distribution facility for domestic party customers is located in Chester, New York, with nearly 900,000 square feet under one roof. This state-of-the-art facility serves as the main point of distribution for our Amscan-branded products and utilizes a paperless, pick-by-light system, a Goods-To-Person (OSR) picking system, offering superior inventory management and turnaround times as short as 48 hours. Refer to Item 2. “Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on other distribution centers that support our US and international customers. 
 Wholesale Customers 
 We have a diverse third-party customer base at wholesale. During 2020, no individual third-party customer accounted for more than 10% of our total third-party sales at wholesale. 
 
Competitive Strengths
 We believe we are well positioned to continue to attract customers who celebrate life’s memorable events as a result of the following competitive strengths:
 •
Category defining multi-channel retailer. We believe we are the premier decorated party supplies retailer, providing a one-stop fun and engaging shopping experience with a broad and deep selection of products offered at a compelling value seamlessly through our retail stores and our e-commerce platform. We keep our assortment current by frequently introducing new products, and we organize our stores by events and themes to make it easy to shop while consistently presenting customers with additional product ideas that will enhance their events and our sales. With our extensive product selection, convenient locations, consistently high in-stock positions and compelling value proposition, we believe customers associate Party City with successful celebrations, and, as a result, our physical and online stores will continue to be seen as the favored destination for party supplies and innovative ideas.
 •
Leading market position. Based on our revenues, we are the largest retailer of decorated party supplies in the U.S. and Canada, and we believe we are the only party supply retailer with a national store footprint. In addition to our leading retail presence, we believe that our integrated wholesale business is the largest global designer, manufacturer and distributor of decorated consumer party products, by revenue, with over 45,000 SKUs found in retail outlets worldwide. Through our category-leading brands, Party City and Amscan, we offer what we believe is the broadest selection of continuously updated and innovative merchandise at a compelling value. We believe that our scale, brand recognition and value proposition underscore our credibility as the destination of choice for party supplies in any channel.
 •
Unique vertically integrated operating model. We manufacture, source and distribute decorated consumer party products, acting as a one-stop shop for both retail and wholesale customers. Our vertically integrated model provides us with a number of advantages, including the ability to (i) enhance our profitability as we realize the full manufacturing-to-retail margin on a significant portion of our retail sales, (ii) leverage a global sourcing network to reinforce our position as a low-cost provider of quality party supplies and (iii) effectively respond to changes in consumer trends through our in-house design and innovation team.
 •
Broad and innovative product offering. We offer a broad and deep product assortment with an average of 25,000 SKUs offered at any one time in our Party City superstores, supported by the approximately 40,000 SKUs offered online. Our extensive selection offers customers a single source for all of their party needs. Our in-house design team introduces approximately 6,000 products annually, driving innovation in our licensed and unlicensed product offering and supporting increased sales across our channels.
 •
Highly efficient global sourcing and distribution capabilities. Over the past 70 years, we have developed a global network of owned and third-party manufacturers that we believe optimizes speed to market, quality and cost. We also have warehousing and distribution facilities throughout North America and have opened sourcing, quality control and testing offices throughout Asia, with offices located in China, Vietnam, India, Indonesia and Hong Kong. Our global sourcing and distribution capabilities offer our customers best-in-class service levels, rapid fulfillment and competitive prices, and have capacity for continued growth with our business.

•World-Class Management Team with a Proven Track Record. Our senior management team averages 20 years of industry experience and possesses a unique combination of management skills and experience in the party goods sector. Our team has successfully grown our sales and profits during various economic cycles and through several business transformations. Additionally, our team has a strong track record of successful acquisitions and integrations, which continue to be an important part of our overall strategy.
 Growth Strategy
 The Company continues to advance its strategic initiatives that underpin efforts to grow our business and expand on our purpose of creating joy by making it easy to create unforgettable memories.
 •
Develop a more relevant in-store experience. We continue to make progress on our next generation store prototype, as we test changes to provide a better shopping experience for our customers. We found that our traditional store formats could be overwhelming to some customers and time-consuming to navigate, which provides a natural opportunity for us to simplify the shopping experience. The material changes to our stores include a new shop-in-shop store layout with improved product adjacencies, edited and more curated product assortments, reduced inventory, as well as new services and experiences. A new balloon shop and customer engagement center are now the focal point of the store and add significant theater to the entire experience. Balloon sales growth in our next-gen stores are significantly higher than the trend in the balance of the chain. Customers have also told us that they appreciate the decluttering of the stores due to the lower sightlines and the more curated assortment.
 •
Win in balloons. For manufacturing and wholesale, all the way through to Party City retail, balloons are a focal point of our growth strategy. With the recent helium shortage behind us, we began 2020 focusing on balloons as a key driver of our differentiated brand experience. As the leader in the global balloon business with an unmatched breadth of balloon assortment, we continue to bring innovation in products, do-it-yourself options and how-to guidelines, along with greater access points to balloons through new digital engagement and additional fulfillment options through curbside pickup and delivery. Buying balloons online with the ability to pick them up in store, at curbside or have them delivered the same day is increasing balloon demand. As part of our balloon business, Anagram designs, manufactures and markets foil balloons and inflated décor. See “—Anagram.” Winning in the balloon category remains a top strategic priority across our enterprise growth initiatives and business disciplines.
 •
Address price value perception in key categories. Customer behavior and insights have told us we were overpriced on some key value indicator items across our assortment. To address this and sharpen our price value perception, since fall of 2019, we have reduced prices on approximately 30% of our total active SKU count. The customer has noticed and has responded favorably with their feedback and the unit sales volume increases we intended. As projected, these reductions in price across product categories have driven increased enterprise margin dollars and increased retail margin rate when coupled with the reduction of previously ineffective promotional offers. We continue to monitor and react to price-related customer insights and price elasticity data on a regular basis. Rebuilding trust with the customer on price is critical to our broad efforts to gain relevancy with consumers, and we are pleased with our progress to date.
 •
Improve our customer engagement selling culture. Improving customer engagement across our marketing messages, our product and merchandising approach, as well as digital experiences with our brand is also critical to driving greater relevancy. Our dramatic shift in digital content, including new, more relevant content formats, carefully curated product assortments and new technology has driven growth in consumer engagement as well as online conversion rates. In 2020, we launched digital workshops and live video formats across our social platforms for the first time, which have garnered hundreds of thousands of views and reached millions of consumers.
 •Our customers are also increasingly looking to create a complete party experience, and we are transforming our company to do more than selling party supplies. We believe there is a clear opportunity to play more of a party planner role with customers who are shopping our stores for party supplies. In order to successfully capitalize on this growing trend, we are focused on improving in-store customer engagement. We are pivoting from a store operations and maintenance culture to a customer engagement and selling culture. This pivot is driven by leading, hiring and training store management and associates with a higher level of accountability for sales and customer engagement metrics. In addition, as we reduce our SKU count in inventory levels, this frees up time for our sales associates to focus on customer engagement.

•Build on our omni-channel platform. Key components of increasing our omnichannel capabilities, such as buy online, pick-up in store, curbside and same-day delivery, are now core to our customer experience. We continue to optimize and add to these experiences as we focus on the customer experience with our brand and seek new and innovative ways to make it easy to create celebrations. In the third quarter of 2020, we rolled out an enhanced curbside delivery experience in all of our stores allowing customers to communicate their expected pick-up time, arrival and vehicle information, all via text message, which creates a more intuitive and efficient experience for our customers. As customers seek same-day delivery options, we remain focused on improving the customer experience with improved speed and reliability. We are investing in improved technology to enable more proficient orchestration of delivery process and have expanded our last-mile delivery partner network.
 •
Continue to grow our wholesale business. We are transforming our wholesale business from a transactional product selling organization into a strategic category partner via improved consumer insights, assortment, merchandising and promotional strategies, all enabled by world-class service and supply chain capabilities. Additionally, we are focused on driving stronger margins through increased manufacturing and distribution efficiencies with strategic investments in automation, technology, new equipment and process improvement while also improving our inventory management capabilities.
 COVID-19 Update
 Our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by COVID-19. Further, the disruption to the global economy and to our business, along with the decline in our stock price, may negatively impact the carrying value of certain assets, including inventories, accounts receivable, intangibles and goodwill. The full extent to which COVID-19 and the measures to contain it will impact our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and other future developments related to the response to the virus, all of which are highly uncertain, and we expect this uncertainty to continue in 2021. Our results of operations may be affected by the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will continue to actively monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our expected losses.
 We have proactively managed our liquidity profile throughout the last fiscal year and expect to continue to do so going forward. We expect to rely on cash on hand, cash generated by operation and borrowing available under our New ABL Facility to meet our working capital needs.
 However, if the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak continues longer than we expect or the severity worsens, we may need to access other sources of financing, including incurring additional indebtedness, selling our assets and raising additional equity capital. These alternatives may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Information Systems 
 We continually evaluate and upgrade our information systems to enhance the quantity, quality and timeliness of information available to management and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing and distribution facilities, as well as our service at the store level. We have implemented merchandise replenishment software to complement our distribution, planning and allocation processes. The system enhances the store replenishment function by improving in-stock positions, leveraging our distribution infrastructure and allowing us to become more effective in our use of store labor. We have implemented a Point of Sale system and upgraded merchandising systems to standardize technology across all of our domestic retail temporary and permanent superstores.
Human Capital Disclosure
 As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 8,370 full-time employees and 8,928 part-time employees, none of whom is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
 7


Our employees are critical to delivering our company Purpose - inspiring joy to make it easy for our customers to create unforgettable memories. Our employees live by our four company values: Customer First, It Can Be Done, People Matter and Celebrate, and this, along with our focus on key priorities, is driving our transformation. 
 The health and safety of our employees and customers is a top priority. We are laser focused on designing and implementing CDC-compliant COVID protocols and practices and convened an enterprise-wide COVID Task Force to continually evolve our approach as the guidelines shift and evolve. Early on in the pandemic, we were focused on supporting our employees from a mental, emotional and physical wellness perspective, and launched PCHI Cares, a series of communications with resources and information for employees and their families to maintain their own wellness. 
 In 2020, we announced our commitment to Diversity & Inclusion and launched an enterprise-wide assessment which enabled us to develop our 2021 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging strategy built on awareness, education and infrastructure. We believe deeply that diversity creates a high level of employee engagement and drives game-changing innovation.
 Intellectual Property 
 We own the copyrights in the designs we create and use on our products and various trademarks and service marks used on or in connection with our products. It is our practice to register our copyrights with the United States Copyright Office and our trademarks and service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or with other foreign jurisdictions, to the extent we deem necessary. In addition, we rely on unregistered common law trademark rights and unregistered copyrights under applicable U.S. law to distinguish and/or protect our products, services and branding. We do not believe that the loss of copyrights or trademarks with respect to any particular product or products would have a material adverse effect on our business. We hold numerous intellectual property licenses from third parties, allowing us to use various third-party cartoon and other characters and designs on our products, and the images on our metallic balloons and costumes are principally covered by these licenses. None of these licenses is individually material to our aggregate business. We also own patents relating to display racks and balloon weights, none of which are individually material to our aggregate business. 
 We permit our franchisees to use a number of our trademarks and service marks, including Party City, The Discount Party Super Store, Party America, Oh, It’s On, Nobody has More Party for Less, and Halloween City. 
 Government Regulation 
 As a franchisor, we must comply with regulations adopted by the Federal Trade Commission, such as the Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising, which requires us, among other things, to furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise offering circular. We also must comply with a number of state laws that regulate the offer and sale of our franchises and certain substantive aspects of franchisor-franchisee relationships. These laws vary in their application and in their regulatory requirements. State laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises typically require us to, among other things, register before the offer and sale of a franchise can be made in that state and to provide a franchise offering circular to prospective franchisees. 
 State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states. Those laws regulate the franchise relationship, for example, by restricting a franchisor’s rights with regard to the termination, transfer and renewal of a franchise agreement (for example, by requiring “good cause” to exist as a basis for the termination and the franchisor’s decision to refuse to permit the franchisee to exercise its transfer or renewal rights), by requiring the franchisor to give advance notice to the franchisee of the termination and give the franchisee an opportunity to cure most defaults. To date, those laws have not precluded us from seeking franchisees in any given area and have not had a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 8


Our wholesale and retail segments must also comply with applicable regulations adopted by federal agencies, including product safety regulations, and with licensing and other regulations enforced by state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and other departments. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals can delay and sometimes prevent the opening of a new store or the shutting down of an existing store. 
 Our manufacturing operations, stores and other facilities must comply with applicable environmental, health and safety regulations, although the cost of complying with these regulations to date has not been material. More stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use, and environmental factors can delay, and sometimes prevent, development of new stores in particular locations. Our stores must comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act and various state laws governing various matters such as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions. Our stores must also comply with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that employers provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities and that stores must be accessible to customers with disabilities.
