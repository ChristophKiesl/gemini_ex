Competition
 
The banking business is highly competitive, and the Bank experiences competition from a number of other financial institutions and non-bank financial competitors, many of whom may not be subject to the same extensive regulatory regime as the Bank. Competition is based upon relationships, the quality and scope of services levels, interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans, other credit and service charges relating to loans, the convenience of banking facilities, the availability of technology channels, and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. The Bank competes with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, farm credit organizations, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as super-regional, national, and international financial institutions that operate offices within the Company’s market area and beyond.

Supervision and Regulation
 
Bank and Holding Company Laws, Rules and Regulations. The Company and the Bank are subject to an extensive system of the laws, rules, and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of customers, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), and the banking system in general and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors. These laws and regulations govern areas such as capital, permissible activities, allowance for loan and lease losses, loans and investments, interest rates that can be charged on loans, and consumer protection communications and disclosures. Certain elements of selected laws, rules, and regulations are described in the sections that follow. These descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the laws, rules, and regulations.
Limestone Bancorp. The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”). As such, the Company must file with the Federal Reserve Board annual and quarterly reports and other information regarding the Company’s business operations and the business operations of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Company is also subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board and to operational guidelines established by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act and other federal laws on the types of activities in which it may engage, and to other supervisory requirements, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations.
Acquisitions. As a bank holding company, the Company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting stock or all or substantially all of the assets of a bank, before merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company, and before engaging, or acquiring a company that is not a bank and is engaged in certain non-banking activities. For any acquisition transaction structured as a merger of the Bank, the approval of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions (“KDFI”) would be required.
 
The Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Bank Control Act prohibit a person or group of persons from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company without notifying the Federal Reserve Board in advance and obtaining the Federal Reserve Board’s approval of, or non-objection to, the proposed transaction. The Federal Reserve Board has established a rebuttable presumptive standard that the acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company that has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (such as the Company) constitutes an acquisition of control of the bank holding company for purposes of the Change in Bank Control Act. An acquisition of 25% of any class of voting securities of a bank holding company will conclusively be deemed to be an acquisition of control under the Change in Bank Control Act.
 
Permissible Activities. The Company is generally permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act to own up to 5% of the voting shares of a company and, subject to the receipt of any required approval by the Federal Reserve Board, to engage in or acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, bank holding company or company engaged in any activity that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking.
 
Under current federal law, a bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company, which enables the holding company to conduct activities that are “financial in nature,” incidental to financial activity, or complementary to financial activity that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. Activities that are “financial in nature” include securities underwriting, dealing and market making in securities; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking activities; and activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related to banking. No prior regulatory approval or notice is required for a financial holding company to acquire a company, other than a bank or savings association, engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company has not filed an election to become a financial holding company.
 
Source of Financial Strength. Under Federal Reserve policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, its bank subsidiaries. This support may be required at times when, absent such a policy, the bank holding company may not be inclined to provide it. In addition, any capital loans by the bank holding company to its bank subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of the bank subsidiary. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of subsidiary banks will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. The Federal Reserve’s “Source of Financial Strength” policy was codified in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”).

Dividends. Under Federal Reserve Board policy, bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not declare a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries.
 
The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The majority of the Company’s revenue has been from dividends paid to it by the Bank. The Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay. If, in the opinion of a federal regulatory agency, an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice, the agency may require, after notice and hearing, that the institution cease such practice. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The Bank is prohibited from paying any dividend if undercapitalized or if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized, and it must maintain a sufficient capital conservation buffer under the capital adequacy guidelines in order to avoid limitations on dividends. Moreover, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.
 
Under Kentucky law, dividends by Kentucky banks may be paid only from current or retained net profits. The KDFI must approve the declaration of dividends if the total dividends to be declared by a bank for any calendar year would exceed the bank’s total net profits for such year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of preferred stock or debt. Additionally, retained earnings must be positive. The Company is also subject to the Kentucky Business Corporation Act, which generally prohibits dividends to the extent they result in the insolvency of the corporation from a balance sheet perspective or if the corporation is unable to pay its debts as they come due.
 
Based on these regulations, the Bank was eligible to pay $20.4 million of dividends as of December 31, 2022. The Bank paid the Company $7.5 million of dividends during 2022.
 
Limestone Bank. The Bank, a Kentucky chartered commercial bank, is subject to regular bank examinations and other supervision and regulation by both the FDIC and the KDFI. Kentucky’s banking statutes contain a “super-parity” provision that permits a well-rated Kentucky banking corporation to engage in any banking activity which could be engaged in by a national bank operating in Kentucky; a state bank, a thrift or savings bank operating in any other state; or a federal chartered thrift or federal savings association meeting the qualified thrift lender test and operating in any state could engage, provided the Kentucky bank first obtains a legal opinion specifying the statutory or regulatory provisions that permit the activity.
Capital Adequacy Requirements. The Company and the Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy guidelines. Guidelines are established by the Federal Reserve Board for the Company and the FDIC for the Bank. Both the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have substantially similar risk based and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations, which are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital related to the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet instruments. The capital adequacy guidelines are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria, assuming they have the highest regulatory rating. Banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios. The federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant. Federal Reserve Board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets.
 
The minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank are a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The rules also require a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios. Including this buffer, the required ratios are: a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%.
 
An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum levels plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible capital that can be utilized for such actions.
 
Under the capital rules, Tier 1 capital generally consists of common stock (plus related surplus) and retained earnings, limited amounts of minority interest in the form of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, and non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, subject to certain eligibility standards, less goodwill and other specified intangible assets and other regulatory deductions. Tier 2 capital may consist of subordinated debt, certain hybrid capital instruments, qualifying preferred stock, and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses. Proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier 1 capital unless issued before 2010 by an institution with less than $15 billion of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.

Prompt Corrective Action. Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), the FDIC must take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. FDIC regulations define the levels at which an insured institution would be considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized”. A bank is “undercapitalized” if it fails to meet any one of the ratios required to be adequately capitalized. A depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. The degree of regulatory scrutiny increases and the permissible activities of a bank decrease as the bank moves downward through the capital categories. Depending on a bank’s level of capital, an institution may be required to submit a capital restoration plan, and its holding company must guarantee compliance with the capital restoration plan up to 5% of the institution’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized.
Deposit Insurance Assessments. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to the deposit insurance premium assessments of the DIF. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system, which calculates a bank’s premium assessment by multiplying its risk-based assessment rate by its assessment base. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank’s assessment base is determined by its consolidated total assets less average tangible equity rather than deposits.
Safety and Soundness Standards. The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to these matters. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of FDIA. See “Prompt Corrective Actions” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.
Incentive Compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets, such as the Company and the Bank, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to adopt rules under which listed companies must have (and disclose) a “clawback” policy for the recovery of erroneously awarded executive incentive compensation following an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws. In October 2022, the SEC finalized rules to require listing standards to be updated to implement this “clawback” policy requirement and to impose related disclosure requirements on listed companies. When fully implemented, listed companies, like the Company, will be required to have a policy providing for the recovery, in the event of a required accounting restatement, of incentive-based compensation received by current or former executive officers where that compensation is based on the erroneously reported financial information.
 
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies of banking organizations intended to ensure that these policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees who have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011, and reproposed the regulations in 2016, but they have not been finalized.
 
    6 

  

The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions.
 
Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
 
Branching. Kentucky law permits Kentucky chartered banks to establish a banking office in any county in Kentucky. A Kentucky bank may also establish a banking office outside of Kentucky. Well capitalized Kentucky banks that have been in operation at least three years and satisfy certain criteria relating to, among other things, their composite and management ratings, may establish a banking office in Kentucky without the approval of the KDFI upon notice to the KDFI and any other state bank with its main office located in the county where the new banking office will be located. Otherwise, branching requires the approval of the KDFI, which must ascertain and determine that the public convenience and advantage will be served and promoted and that there is reasonable probability of the successful operation of the banking office. The transaction must also be approved by the FDIC, which considers a number of factors, including financial history, capital adequacy, earnings prospects, character of management, needs of the community, and consistency with corporate powers.
 
Section 613 of the Dodd-Frank Act effectively eliminated the interstate branching restrictions set forth in the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. Banks located in any state may now de novo branch in any other state, including Kentucky. Such unlimited branching power may increase competition within the markets in which the Company and the Bank operate.
 
Insider Credit Transactions. The restrictions on loans to directors, executive officers, principal shareholders and their related interests (collectively referred to as “insiders”) contained in the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O apply to all insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries. These restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made. There is also an aggregate limitation on all loans to insiders and their related interests, which may not exceed the institution’s total unimpaired capital and surplus.
Consumer Protection Laws. The Bank is subject to federal consumer protection statues and regulations promulgated under those laws, including, but not limited to, the:
 

● | Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinanced loans;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), requiring lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibiting certain abusive practices;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act (“S.A.F.E. Act”), requiring residential loan originators who are employees of financial institutions to meet registration requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, governing the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, and the Fair Housing Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, and a variety of other prohibited factors in the extension of credit;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Truth in Savings Act, which requires disclosure of deposit terms to consumers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regulation CC, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, establishing rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund transfer systems such as automated teller machine transfers, telephone bill-payment services, point-of-sale (POS) terminal transfers in stores, and preauthorized transfers from or to a consumer's account; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Automated Overdraft Payment Regulations, requiring financial institutions to provide customer notices, monitor overdraft payment programs, and prohibiting financial institutions from charging consumer fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one time debit card transactions unless a consumer consents, or opts in to the service for those types of transactions.

The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws. As a bank with less than $10 billion or more in assets, the Bank is subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB, but continues to be examined and supervised by the FDIC, its federal banking regulator for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The CFPB has established certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower’s ability to repay. The Dodd-Frank Act allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a “qualified mortgage” as defined by the CFPB. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act created a qualified mortgage safe harbor for eligible loans that are originated and retained by a bank with total assets of less than $10 billion.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act also permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.
 
Loans to One Borrower. Under current limits, loans and extensions of credit outstanding at one time to a single borrower and not fully secured generally may not exceed 20% of an institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans and extensions of credit fully secured by collateral may represent an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus.
Privacy. Federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, the Bank must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, its policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers’ nonpublic personal financial information. Except for certain limited exceptions, the Bank may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless it discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means.
Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires the FDIC to assess the Company’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities the Bank serves, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. The FDIC’s assessment of the Company’s record is made available to the public. The assessment also is part of the Federal Reserve Board’s and the FDIC’s consideration of applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company, to establish a new banking office or to relocate an office.
Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (“BSA”) was enacted to deter money laundering, establish regulatory reporting standards for currency transactions, and improve detection and investigation of criminal, tax, and other regulatory violations. BSA and subsequent laws and regulations require steps to be taken to prevent the use of the Bank in the flow of illegal or illicit money, including, without limitation, ensuring effective management oversight, establishing sound policies and procedures, developing effective monitoring and reporting capabilities, ensuring adequate training, and establishing a comprehensive internal audit of BSA compliance activities. Rules issued under the BSA require the Bank to identify the beneficial owners who own or control certain legal entity customers at the time an account is opened and to include in its anti-money laundering program risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence.
USA Patriot Act. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) contains anti-money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions. The Patriot Act requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. This includes standards for verifying customer identification at account opening, as well as rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. It grants the Secretary of the Treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on the operations of financial institutions. In addition, the Patriot Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions.
The Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed new restrictions and requirements and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions and their holding companies. The implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in greater compliance costs and higher fees paid to regulators. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 provided some regulatory relief to banking organizations, primarily small, community banking organizations, by adjusting thresholds at which certain increased regulatory requirements imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act begin to apply. As a result, traditional community banking organizations with assets of less than $10 billion, such as the Company, are exempt from the Volker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act, which places limits and restrictions on trading and hedging activities. In addition, community banking organizations with assets of less than $10 billion are now subject to reduced reporting requirements and an optional simplified capital adequacy measure is available to those that have a leverage ratio greater than 9%. The Bank elected not to use this optional capital adequacy measure.

Effect of Economic Environment. The policies of regulatory authorities, including the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Board, have a significant effect on the operating results of bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries. Among the means available to the Federal Reserve Board to affect the money supply are open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.
 
Federal Reserve Board monetary policies have materially affected the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on the Company’s business and earnings and those of the Company’s subsidiaries cannot be predicted.
 
Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. From time to time various laws, regulations, and governmental programs affecting financial institutions and the financial industry are introduced in Congress or otherwise promulgated by regulatory agencies. Such measures may change the environment in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate in substantial and unpredictable ways. The nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory, or other changes affecting financial institutions are unpredictable at this time. Future legislation, policies, and the effects thereof might have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments, and deposits. They also may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits. New legislation and policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.
