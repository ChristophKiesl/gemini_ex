ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Perrigo Company plc was incorporated under the laws of Ireland on June 28, 2013. We became the successor registrant to Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation, on December 18, 2013 in connection with the acquisition of Elan Corporation, plc ("Elan"), which is discussed further in Item 8. Note 2. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "Perrigo", the "Company", "we," "our," "us," and similar pronouns used herein refer to Perrigo Company plc, its subsidiaries, and all predecessors of Perrigo Company plc and its subsidiaries. 
WHO WE ARE
We are a leading global over-the-counter ("OTC") consumer goods and pharmaceutical company, offering patients and customers high quality products at affordable prices. From our beginning in 1887 as a packager of home remedies, we have grown to become the world's largest manufacturer of OTC healthcare products and supplier of infant formulas for the store brand market. We are also a leading provider of generic standard topical products such as creams, lotions, and gels, as well as inhalants and injections ("extended topical") prescription products in the U.S. We also received royalties from sales of the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri® but divested our rights to those royalties effective beginning January 1, 2017. We provide “Quality Affordable Healthcare Products®” across a wide variety of product categories and geographies, primarily in North America, Europe, and Australia, as well as in other markets, including Israel, and China.
MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS
Restatement
In connection with our year-end financial statement close and preparation of our Form 10-K for 2016, we identified misstatements in our historical financial statements, including for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, six months ended December 31, 2015, and the years ended June 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014 (the "Restated Periods"). Accordingly, we have restated the consolidated financial statements for the Restated Periods (and certain financial statements for interim periods within the Restated Periods) to reflect the correction of the misstatements, the most significant of which are described below. The segments predominantly affected by this restatement are Specialty Sciences and CHCI. Refer to Item 8. Note 10 of the Consolidated financial statements for additional information on how this restatement affects our debt covenants.
During the 2016 year-end financial statement close process, and in anticipation of our potential sale of our royalty rights, we evaluated the potential effects of the Tysabri® royalty stream sale accounting and the accounting

Business Overview

and disclosures associated with the pending 2018 adoption of ASC 606 “Revenues from Contracts with Customers.” After an extensive evaluation of the facts and circumstances and the judgments required to determine the appropriate classification, it was determined that under existing U.S. GAAP the contingent payments from Elan's May 2013 sale of Tysabri® to Biogen (the "Tysabri® royalty stream") should have been recorded as a financial asset, rather than an intangible asset, on the date of our acquisition of Elan.
Our Tysabri® royalty stream is now accounted for in our consolidated financial statements for 2016 and prior restated periods as a financial asset using the fair value option. We made the election to account for the Tysabri® financial asset using the fair value option as we believe this method is most appropriate for an asset that does not have a par value, a stated interest stream, or a termination date. Accounting for the Tysabri® royalty stream as a financial asset required us to adjust our financial statements for the Restated Periods to (1) remove the Tysabri® royalty stream from net sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, (2) remove the amortization expense (reflected in cost of goods sold) associated with recording the Tysabri® royalty stream as an intangible asset, and (3) include the quarterly changes in fair value of the Tysabri® royalty stream as a component of other non-operating income/expense. The cash payments we received from the royalty stream are included in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Restated Periods and reflect the cash received from the Tysabri® royalty stream as cash from investing activities, rather than as cash from operating activities.
In addition, in connection with the financial closing for the year ended December 31, 2016, we identified certain tax basis intangible assets that existed at the time of the acquisition of Omega Pharma Invest N.V. (“Omega”) on March 30, 2015, which reduced the deferred tax liabilities in acquired intangible assets and increased our valuation allowance resulting in a net change to our deferred taxes of approximately $236.3 million. The resulting balance sheet reclassification required a reduction of goodwill, offset by a corresponding reduction to net deferred taxes at the date of the Omega acquisition. Further, we have evaluated the accounting effect subsequent to the acquisition date related to the remeasured deferred tax liability, including the impairments of Omega goodwill recorded in 2016 and certain adjustments to valuation allowances, which have been reflected in the Restated Periods.
In restating our financial statements to correct the misstatements discussed above, we are also making adjustments for previously identified required corrections with respect to the Restated Periods. When these financial statements were originally issued, we assessed the impact of these unrecorded adjustments and concluded that they were not material individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial statements. All of the financial information presented in this Item 1 has been revised to reflect the restatement more fully described in Item 8. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Restructuring
On February 21, 2017, we approved a workforce reduction plan as part of a larger cost optimization strategy across the Company. We expect to reduce our global workforce by approximately 750 employees, which includes some actions already taken and 235 employees who have elected to participate in a voluntary early retirement program. This represents a reduction of approximately 14% of our global non-production workforce.  The changes to our workforce will vary by country, based on legal requirements and required consultations with works councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate.
In connection with this plan, we estimate that we will recognize total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $70.0 million to $80.0 million, consisting of one-time termination benefits, severance arrangements, and other termination costs. We anticipate recognizing substantially all of these charges during the year ending December 31, 2017, with the remaining balance to be recognized during the first quarter of the year ending December 31, 2018.
 4

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Business Overview

Our cost optimization strategy is expected to yield approximately $130.0 million in savings per annum by mid-2018. This is in addition to the savings that our supply chain organization continues to generate for both our North American and International segments.
Segments
In the fourth quarter of 2016, we changed our reporting segments to better align with our new organizational structure. These organizational changes were made to optimize our structure to better serve our customers and to reflect the way in which our chief operating decision maker reviews our operating results and allocates resources. The changes in our reporting segments are as follows:

• | Consumer Healthcare Americas ("CHCA"), comprises our U.S., Mexico and Canada consumer healthcare business (OTC, contract, infant formula and animal health categories).


• | Consumer Healthcare International ("CHCI"), comprises our legacy Branded Consumer Healthcare segment and now includes our consumer focused businesses in the U.K., Australia, and Israel, which were previously reported in the legacy Consumer Healthcare segment. This segment includes our U.K. liquid licensed products business, which was previously reported in the Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment.


• | Prescription Pharmaceuticals ("RX"), comprises our U.S. Prescription Pharmaceuticals business.


• | Specialty Sciences, continued to comprise the Tysabri® Royalty Stream.

We also have an "Other" reporting segment that will continue to comprise our legacy Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients ("API") business, which does not meet the quantitative threshold required to be a separately reportable segment. On December 9, 2016, an agreement was signed to sell a portion of our India API business. See Item 8. Note 2 for additional information. Financial information related to our business segments and geographic locations can be found in Item 8. Note 19. 
Omega Acquisition
On March 30, 2015, we acquired Omega, for $3.0 billion in equity and cash and assumed debt of $1.6 billion, for a total purchase price of $4.6 billion. Prior to its acquisition, Omega was one of the largest OTC companies in Europe. The Omega acquisition expanded our OTC leadership position into continental Europe, accelerated our international expansion and geographic diversification through enhanced scale and a broader footprint, and diversified our net sales and cash flow streams.
The broader European platform established through the Omega acquisition, facilitated the acquisition of a portfolio of well-established OTC brands sold primarily in Europe from GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (“GSK”) on August 28, 2015 and Naturwohl Pharma, GmbH ("Naturwohl"), with its leading German dietary supplement brand, Yokebe®, on September 15, 2015. Additional information on the Omega, GSK, and Naturwohl acquisitions can be found in Item 8. Note 2. Subsequently, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we identified impairment indicators associated with certain intangible assets and goodwill which required us to test these assets for impairment. As a result, we recorded total impairments of $2.0 billion. Refer to Item 8. Note 3 for additional information.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Business Overview

Elan Acquisition
On December 18, 2013, we acquired Elan in a cash and stock transaction totaling $9.5 billion. The acquisition led to the creation of our new corporate structure headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. We have utilized this structure to continue to grow in our core markets and further expand outside of the U.S. The acquisition also provided us with the Tysabri® royalty stream. Additional information on the Elan acquisition can be found in Item 8. Note 2. Subsequently, on March 27, 2017, we announced the completed divestment of the Tysabri® royalty stream to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, which consists of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in royalties earned if global net sales of Tysabri® meet specific thresholds in 2018 and 2020, respectively. As a result of this transaction, we will derecognize the Tysabri® financial asset in the first quarter of 2017 and we do not expect the disposition to have a material impact on our results. We initiated a strategic review of the Tysabri® royalty stream in November 2016. In that connection, we received indications of the fair value of that royalty stream, which led to a goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016. Refer to Item 8. Note 3 and Note 6 for additional information on the impairment and fair value adjustments, respectively.
NEW PRODUCTS
We consider a product to be new if it was (i) reformulated, (ii) involved product line extension due to changes in characteristics such as strength, flavor, or color, (iii) involved a change in product status from "prescription only" ("Rx") to OTC, (iv) was a new generic or branded launch, (v) was provided in a new dosage form or (vi) was sold to a new geographic area with different regulatory authorities, in all cases, within 12 months prior to the end of the period for which net sales are being measured. New product sales were as follows (in millions):

Year Ended | | Six Months Ended | Year Ended 
December 31, 2016 | | December 31, 2015 | December 31, 2015 | | December 27, 2014(1) | June 27, 2015 | | June 28, 2014(1)
$ | 311.1 | | $ | 460.9 | | $ | 231.1 | | $ | 77.3 | $ | 273.8 | $ | 231.4

(1) Excludes Omega activity; acquisition took place on March 30, 2015.
CONSUMER HEALTHCARE AMERICAS
Overview
The CHCA segment is focused primarily on the sale of OTC store brand products, including cough, cold, allergy and sinus, analgesic, gastrointestinal, smoking cessation, infant formula and food, animal health, and diagnostic products in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. We are a leading provider of consumer healthcare products sold to consumers via store brands and also sell consumer healthcare products under our own brands. Consumer awareness and knowledge of the quality and value that OTC store brand products represent continues to grow due to retailer efforts to promote their own label programs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our CHCA segment represented approximately 48% of consolidated net sales. 
The CHCA segment develops, manufactures, and markets products that are comparable in quality and effectiveness to national brands. Store brand products must meet the same U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") requirements as national brands within the U.S. and the requirements of comparable regulatory bodies outside the U.S. In most instances our product packaging is designed to invite and reinforce comparison to national brand products, while communicating store brand value to consumers.
The cost of store brand products to retailers is significantly lower than that of comparable nationally advertised brand-name products. Generally, retailers’ dollar profit per unit of store brand product is greater than the dollar profit per unit of the comparable national brand product. The retailer, therefore, can price a store brand product below the competing national brand product and realize a greater profit margin. The consumer benefits by receiving a high quality product at a price below the comparable national brand product. As a result, our business model results in consumers saving money on their healthcare spending. 

We are dedicated to continuing to be the leader in developing and marketing new OTC store brand products and have a research and development ("R&D") staff that we believe is one of the most experienced in the 
 6

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCA

industry at developing products comparable in formulation and quality to national brand products. Our R&D team also responds to changes in existing national brand products by reformulating existing products. For example, in the OTC pharmaceutical market, certain new products are the result of changes in product status from Rx to OTC. These “Rx-to-OTC switches” require FDA approval through a process initiated by the drug innovator. The drug innovator usually begins the process by filing a New Drug Application ("NDA"), which is often followed by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA"). See "Government Regulation and Pricing" below for more information on these FDA processes.
New drugs are also marketed through the FDA's OTC monograph process, which allows for the production of drugs that are generally recognized as safe and effective without pre-marketing approval. The CHCA segment also develops, manufactures, and distributes certain branded products when the strategy is synergistic with our store brand business. Branded products include the Good Sense®, Sergeant's®, Sentry®, Zephrex D®, PetArmor®, and the ScarAway® brand names.
We manufacture a significant portion of our CHCA segment's products at our plants in the U.S., Mexico, and Israel, and we source our remaining needs from third parties. We rely on both internal R&D and strategic product development agreements with outside sources to develop new products. In addition, in order to maximize both our capacity and sales of proprietary formulas, we engage in contract manufacturing, which involves producing unique ANDAs and monograph products through partnerships with major pharmaceutical and direct-to-consumer companies.
We believe the increasing age of the population will drive the need for the greater value that our store brand products provide consumers. In addition, we believe that new products and products switching from Rx to OTC (as described above) will continue to drive growth within the segment.
Recent Developments

• | In 2016, we experienced a reduction in pricing expectations within our CHCA segment, particularly in the cough/cold, animal health and analgesics categories due to various factors including increased focus from customers to capture supply chain productivity savings, low raw material commodity pricing, and competition in specific product categories. We expect this pricing environment to continue to impact our CHCA segment for the foreseeable future.


• | On August 5, 2016, we completed the sale of our U.S. Vitamin, Minerals, and Supplements ("VMS") business to International Vitamin Corporation for $61.8 million inclusive of an estimated working capital adjustment. See Item 8. Note 2 for additional discussion of the divestiture.

Products
Our CHCA segment offers products in the following categories:

Product Category | Description 
Analgesics | Pain relievers and fever reducers 
Cough/cold/allergy/sinus | Cough, cold, allergy, and sinus products 
Gastrointestinal | Antacids, anti-diarrheal, and anti-heartburn products 
Infant nutritionals | Infant formula and food products 
Smoking cessation | Gums, lozenges, and other products designed to help users quit smoking 
Animal health | Pet health and wellness products 
Other | Feminine hygiene, diabetes care, dermatological care, diagnostic products, scar management, and other miscellaneous healthcare products

The chart below reflects total net sales by product category in the CHCA segment for the year ended December 31, 2016.

We launched a number of new CHCA products in the year ended December 31, 2016, most notably fluticasone nasal spray (store brand equivalent to Flonase®), certain products from the guaifenesin family of products (store brand equivalent to Mucinex®), several new infant formula and food products, and new animal health products. Net sales related to new CHCA products totaled (in millions):

Year Ended | | Six Months Ended | Year Ended 
December 31, 2016 | | December 31, 2015 | December 31, 2015 | | December 27, 2014 | June 27, 2015 | | June 28, 2014
$ | 117.4 | | $ | 235.2 | | $ | 122.9 | | $ | 33.2 | $ | 145.5 | $ | 75.5

We, on our own or in conjunction with partners, received final approval from U.S. health authorities for six new products within the CHCA segment in the year ended December 31, 2016, and as of December 31, 2016, we had six new product applications pending approval.
Sales and Marketing 
Our customers include major global, national, and regional retail drug, supermarket, and mass merchandise chains such as Walmart, CVS, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Rite Aid, Kroger, Target, Dollar General, Sam’s Club, Costco, Petco, Petsmart, and major wholesalers, including McKesson, Cardinal Health, and Amerisource Bergen.
We seek to establish customer loyalty through superior customer service by providing a comprehensive assortment of high quality, value-priced products; timely processing, shipment and delivery of orders; assistance in managing customer inventories; and support in managing and building the customer’s store brand business. The CHCA segment employs its own sales force to service larger customers, and uses industry brokers for other retailers. Field sales employees, with support from marketing and customer service, are assigned to specific customers in order to work most effectively with the customer. They assist customers by developing customized brand and in-store marketing programs for customers' store brand products.
The primary objective of this store brand management approach is to enable our customers, retailers and wholesalers, to increase sales of their own store brand products by communicating store brand quality and value to the consumer and by inviting comparison to national brand products. Our sales and marketing personnel assist customers in the development and introduction of new store brand products and in the promotion of customers’ 
 8

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCA

existing store brand products by providing market information; establishing individualized promotions and marketing programs, which may include floor displays, bonus sizes, coupons, rebates, store signs, and promotional packs; and performing consumer research.
In contrast with national brand manufacturers, which incur considerable advertising and marketing expenditures targeted directly to the end user or consumer, the CHCA segment’s primary marketing efforts are channeled through retailers and wholesalers and reach the consumer through our customers’ in-store marketing programs and our digital media programs. Because the retail profit margin for store brand products is generally higher than for national brand products, retailers and wholesalers often commit funds for additional promotions.
Our animal health category, which has a greater emphasis on value-branded products, promotes product awareness through direct-to-consumer advertising including television commercials, online advertising, in-store display vehicles, and social media. In addition to in-store marketing programs, our infant formula category markets directly to consumers and healthcare professionals.
Competition
The markets for OTC pharmaceuticals and infant formula are highly competitive. Our primary competitors include manufacturers, such as LNK International, Inc., PL Developments, and Dr. Reddy's Labs, and brand-name pharmaceutical and consumer product companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Bayer AG, GSK, Nestle S.A. (Gerber), Abbott Nutrition, Aurobindo Pharma, and Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. The competition is highly fragmented in terms of geographic market coverage and product categories, such that a competitor generally does not compete across all product lines. However, some competitors do have larger sales volumes in certain of our categories. Additionally, national brand companies tend to have more resources committed to marketing their products and could in the future manufacture store brands of their products at lower prices than their national brand products. Competition is based on a variety of factors, including price, quality, assortment of products, customer service, marketing support, and approvals for new products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for additional information and risks associated with competition.
CONSUMER HEALTHCARE INTERNATIONAL
Overview
The CHCI segment is comprised primarily of branded OTC sales attributable to Omega and also includes our consumer focused businesses in the U.K., Australia, and Israel, which were previously reported in the legacy Consumer Healthcare segment. The CHCI segment develops, manufactures, markets and distributes many well-known European OTC brands in the natural health and vitamins, cough, cold and allergy, smoking cessation, personal care and derma-therapeutics, lifestyle, and anti-parasite categories. In addition, the segment leverages its broad regulatory, sales, and distribution infrastructure to in-license and sell third-party brands and generic pharmaceutical products. The CHCI segment distributes these products through an extensive network of customers including pharmacies, wholesalers, drug and grocery store retailers, and para pharmacies in 30 countries, primarily in Europe. Many CHCI products are top sellers in the markets in which they compete. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the CHCI segment represented approximately 31% of consolidated net sales.
Through continued investment in R&D partnerships and new technologies, the CHCI segment strives to offer high quality products that meet consumers' needs. The combination of internal R&D, in-licensing, acquisitions, and partnerships support the product pipeline, both in terms of brand expansion and product improvement. In the U.K., R&D focuses on oral liquid formulations for the branded Rx products for which liquid formulations are not available and development of store brand products. In the rest of Europe, most R&D is performed by external partners with oversight by our teams. The segment has seven plants dedicated to manufacturing certain of its products, but over 80% of its production is outsourced to third parties. We are transitioning some of the segment's R&D and manufacturing in-house as we continue to integrate Omega into our operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we brought the production of four major products in-house. We expect that by the end of 2017, approximately 36% of the products that we sell in Europe would be manufactured at our own plants.
The CHCI segment primarily focuses on building local and national brands. In many markets outside of the U.S., a brand marketing strategy can be more effective than a store brand strategy due to the absence of mass 
 9

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
CHCI

merchandisers and large scale pharmacy chains. Additionally, the absence of a centralized regulatory environment within Europe adds to the complexity of obtaining approvals for products in these markets.
While the CHCI segment sells products from over 350 brands both on its own and through third parties, it focuses its resources on its "Top 20 brands", which are selected on the basis of their current sales and growth potential in the OTC market. Additional resources are allocated to these brands to build strong positions in the largest, most highly profitable categories in the OTC market, while maintaining leadership in smaller branded categories. 
Recent Developments

• | As part of our strategic initiatives, management continues to drive improvements and evaluate the overall cost structures within our CHCI segment in the following ways:


• | On December 8, 2016, we announced the cancellation of the unprofitable EuroGenerics NV distribution agreement in Belgium. The cancellation, combined with the exit of certain OTC distribution agreements, is expected to reduce net sales by approximately $200.0 million in 2017.


• | We continue to make progress on our previously announced restructuring plans to right-size the Omega business due to the impact of market dynamics on sales volumes. In addition, we made several strategic leadership changes during the year ended December 31, 2016, including appointing new leaders for Belgium, France and Germany as well as a new Executive Vice President of the CHCI segment. Management continues to evaluate the overall cost structure relative to current and expected market dynamics. In 2016, we recognized $20.9 million of restructuring expense in the CHCI segment.


• | Management continues to evaluate the most effective business model for each country and has announced strategic evaluations for Russia and Argentina.


• | The CHCI segment has been impacted by market dynamics in key countries such as Belgium, France, Germany and Italy due to softness in certain brand categories and by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, primarily in the U.K. related to Brexit. In addition, the segment had been impacted in Belgium by a change in the forecast with a major wholesaler, as management implements improved supply chain efficiencies in this market. The CHCI segment has restructured its approach to addressing these markets including: (1) implementing a brand prioritization strategy to address these market dynamics, with an objective to balance the cost of advertising and promotional investments with expected contributions from category sales, (2) restructuring its sales force in each of these markets to more effectively serve customers, and (3) exiting certain unfavorable distribution agreements. The combination of these actions are expected to improve the segment's focus on higher value OTC products, reduce selling costs and improve operating margins in the segment.

Anti-Parasite | Products focused on the elimination of parasites in both humans and pets including lice treatment and insect repellent. | Jungle Formula®Paranix® 

Certain brands are considered "combination brands", as they are marketed under different names depending on the market in which they are sold. For these combination brands, we select the most appropriate products from each product line for the country where they will be marketed, then adopt the brand name that best matches local consumer preference.
We launched a number of new CHCI products in the year ended December 31, 2016, most notably products within the Yokebe®, Granufink® , and XLS Max strength® brands. Net sales related to new CHCI products totaled (in millions):

CHCI

Sales and Marketing
Our customers include pharmacies, drug, and grocery stores located primarily in Europe, including Boots, ASDA, Tesco, DM, Rossmann, ETOS, Kruidvat, Woolworths (Australia), and Coles (Australia). The CHCI segment sells its products primarily through an established pharmacy sales force and an extensive network of pharmacists. Our sales representatives visit pharmacists daily, ensuring strong in-store visibility of our brands and facilitating pharmacist education programs. Our sales, marketing, and regulatory teams use training/merchandising teams to work in conjunction with local sales representatives to improve our brands' presence and recognition. We seek to attract key talent from leading OTC, fast moving consumer goods ("FMCG"), and retailer companies to build strong local teams throughout the countries in which the CHCI segment operates. 
While CHCI products have a higher average gross margin than products sold by the CHCA segment, selling expenses are significantly higher due to the sales force mentioned above, as well as targeted advertising and promotional spending to enhance brand equity. Key marketing communication tools for the CHCI segment include TV commercials, consumer leaflets, product websites, digital and targeted promotional campaigns.
Competition
The competitive landscape of the European OTC market is highly fragmented, as local companies often hold leadership positions in individual product segments in particular countries. As a result, the relevant competition in each of the CHCI segment's markets is both local and global. Competitors include Reckitt Benckiser, Boehringer Ingelheim, GSK, Novartis, and Johnson & Johnson as well as additional regional competitors. We believe our key advantage lies in our unique combination of best practices in sales, marketing, and product development from FMCG and OTC/Rx, while embracing the pharmacy channel to drive self-care. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for additional information and risks associated with competition.
PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS
Overview
The RX segment develops, manufactures, and markets a portfolio of generic and specialty pharmaceutical prescription drugs primarily in the U.S. We define this portfolio as predominantly "extended" topical and "specialty" as it encompasses a broad array of topical dosage forms such as creams, ointments, lotions, gels, shampoos, foams, suppositories, sprays, liquids, suspensions, solutions, and powders. The portfolio also includes select controlled substances, injectables, hormones, oral solid dosage forms, and oral liquid formulations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the RX segment represented approximately 20% of consolidated net sales.
Our current development areas include other delivery systems such as oral liquids, metered dose inhalers, injectables, and transdermal products, some of which we are developing with third parties. Our other areas of expertise include our production capabilities for controlled substances and hormonal products. R&D efforts focus on complex formulations, many of which require costly clinical endpoint trials.
We manufacture our topical, specialty, and oral products in the U.S. and Israel, and also source from various FDA-approved third parties. Rx products are manufactured, labeled, and packaged in facilities that comply with strict regulatory standards and meet customers’ stringent requirements.
In addition, the RX segment offers OTC products through the prescription channel (referred to as "ORx®", these products are marketed using the Perrigo name). ORx® products are OTC products that are available for pharmacy fulfillment and healthcare reimbursement when prescribed by a physician. We offer numerous ORx® products that are reimbursable through many health plans and the U.S. Medicaid and Medicare programs. 
We actively collaborate with other pharmaceutical companies to develop, manufacture, and market certain products or groups of products. These types of agreements are common in the pharmaceutical industry. We may choose to enter into these types of agreements to, among other things, leverage our or our collaborators' scientific R&D expertise, or utilize our extensive marketing and distribution resources. See Item 8. Note 1 for more information regarding our method for recognizing revenue and expenses related to collaboration agreements, as well as Item 8. Note 17 for more information regarding our current collaboration agreements.

RX

Recent Developments

• | We continue to experience a significant reduction in pricing expectations from historical levels in our RX segment due to industry and competitive pressures. This softness in pricing is attributed to various factors including increased focus from customers to capture supply chain productivity savings, low raw material commodity pricing, competition in specific products, and consolidation of certain customers. We expect this softness to continue to impact the segment for the foreseeable future, and we are forecasting a 9% to 11% pricing decline in this segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year.


• | On January 22, 2016, we acquired a portfolio of generic dosage forms and strengths of Retin-A® (tretinoin), a topical prescription acne treatment, from Matawan Pharmaceuticals, LLC, for $416.4 million in cash ("Tretinoin Products").


• | On March 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of two development-stage specialty Rx products to further invest in our specialty Rx portfolio.


• | On August 22, 2016, we purchased the remaining 60.9% ownership rights to a generic BenzaclinTM product ("Generic BenzaclinTM"), which we developed and marketed in collaboration with Barr Laboratories. As a result of this transaction, we are now entitled to 100% of income from sales of the product.


• | On November 10, 2016, we announced that as part of our portfolio review process we are conducting a comprehensive internal evaluation of the RX segment's market position, growth opportunities, and interdependencies with our manufacturing and shared service operations to determine if strategic alternatives should be explored.


• | During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the U.S. market for our Entocort® (budesonide) capsules, including both brand and authorized generic capsules, experienced significant and unexpected increased competition, reducing our future revenue stream. This led to an impairment charge of $342.2 million related to the Entocort® intangible asset acquired in 2015. We expect our 2017 net sales to be negatively affected in an amount of approximately $72.0 million. 


• | In December 2016, we transitioned our specialty pharmaceutical commercial activities to our partner, Exeltis, who will lead sales and marketing efforts for this portfolio of products. We do not expect this transition will have an impact on our net sales.

RX

Competition
The market for Rx products is subject to intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand-name pharmaceutical companies launching their own generic version of their branded products (known as an authorized generic), manufacturers of branded drug products that continue to produce those products after patent expirations, and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. Among our generic drug manufacturer competitors are Par Pharmeceuticals, Apotex Corp., Glenmark Generics Inc., Impax Laboratories, Inc., Mylan, Prasco, LLC, Sandoz, Sun Pharmaceuticals, Taro Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Triax Pharmaceuticals, LLC, and Zydus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

We believe that one of our primary competitive advantages is our ability to introduce difficult to develop and/or manufacture topical and other specialty generic versions to brand-name drug products. Generally, these products are exposed to less competition due to the relatively longer and more expensive development, clinical trial, and approval processes. In addition, we believe we have a favorable competitive position due primarily to our efficient distribution systems, topical production economies of scale, customer service, and overall reputation. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for more information and risks associated with competition.
SPECIALTY SCIENCES
Overview
The Specialty Sciences segment is comprised of assets focused on the treatment of multiple sclerosis, specifically in connection with the drug Tysabri® (natalizumab). Although we divested these assets in March 2017, during the periods covered by this report, we continued to receive contingent payments related to the Tysabri royalty stream. These contingent payments are based on a royalty percentage on sales revenue generated by the sale, distribution or other use of the drug Tysabri®. The Specialty Sciences segment also includes the ongoing obligations under the sale agreement between Biogen and Elan for 50% of losses and expenses arising out of any Tysabri® product liability claims, required insurance coverage and related expenses. We have recorded the Tysabri® royalty stream as a financial asset and elected to account for this asset using the fair value option method, which incorporates discounted cash flows related to the expected future cash flows to be received. We use significant judgment in determining our valuation inputs, including estimates as to the probability and timing of future sales of Tysabri®, as well as estimates of the expected future cash flows. The estimated fair value of the asset is subject to variation should those cash flows vary significantly from our estimates. We have performed an evaluation at each reporting period to assess those estimates, discount rates utilized and general market conditions affecting fair value.
We were entitled to contingent payments from Biogen based on its Tysabri® sales for all indications and geographies. We received contingent payments that were based on royalties of 12% on worldwide Biogen sales of Tysabri® from December 18, 2013 through April 30, 2014. As of May 1, 2014, we received royalties of 18% on annual worldwide Biogen sales of Tysabri® up to $2.0 billion and 25% on annual sales above $2.0 billion. The cash received from Biogen for the royalty percentage on Tysabri® sales is recorded as cash flows from investing activities in our Consolidation Statements of Cash Flow.
Recent Developments

• | In February 2016, a competitor's pipeline product, Ocrevus®, received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA and was approved in 2017. The product is expected to compete with Tysabri® and have a significant negative impact on the Tysabri® royalty stream. Although the product has not launched, industry analysts believe that based on released clinical study information, Ocrevus® will favorably compete against Tysabri® in the relapsing, remitting multiple sclerosis market segment due to its high efficacy and convenient dosage form.

Specialty Sciences


• | On November 15, 2016, Biogen received additional intellectual property protection for Tysabri® as they were granted a new patent in the U.S. with coverage to 2027.


• | On March 27, 2017, we announced the completed divestment of our Tysabri® royalty stream to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, which consists of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in milestone payments to us if the royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® that are received by Royalty Pharma meet specific thresholds in 2018 and 2020, respectively. As a result of this transaction, we will derecognize the Tysabri® financial asset in the first quarter of 2017 and we do not expect the disposition to have a material impact on our results.

Competition
Tysabri® is a complex biological product that is administered under a strict Risk and Evaluation Mitigation Strategy ("REMS") program. The majority of its patents are protected through 2024. In the event that a patent is invalidated or is infringed upon or a biosimilar is introduced, the financial performance of our Specialty Sciences segment would be materially adversely affected. Tysabri® competes with many companies that are working to develop successful new therapies or alternative formulations of products for multiple sclerosis, including Ocrevus® as mentioned above. If any of these competing products have a similar or more attractive profile in terms of efficacy, convenience, or safety, future sales of Tysabri® could be impacted. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for related risks.
OTHER
Overview
We have an Other segment that is primarily comprised of sales of API products, which does not meet the quantitative threshold required to be a separate reportable segment. We develop, manufacture, and market API products, which are used worldwide by both generic and branded pharmaceutical companies. Certain of these ingredients are used in our own pharmaceutical products. The manufacturing of API occurs primarily in Israel with some production in India. 
API development is focused on the synthesis of less common molecules for the U.S., European, and other global markets. We commercialize API that are critical to our pharmaceutical customers’ existing portfolios and future product launches, working closely with these customers on development processes. We are also focusing manufacturing and development activities on the synthesis of molecules for use in our own OTC and Rx pipeline products. This vertical integration may enable us to be more competitive in the pricing of our product lines. 
Because our API customers depend on high quality supply and regulatory support, we focus on rigorous quality assurance, quality control, and regulatory compliance as part of our strategic positioning. Our quality system is designed to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA, the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"), and other regulatory agencies such as the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. We are regularly inspected by various regulatory authorities and customers. 
Recent Developments
On April 6, 2017, we completed the divestment of our India API business to Strides Shasun Limited. As of December 31, 2016, the net assets of our India API business were classified as "held for sale" as discussed in Item 8. Note 9. The sale is not expected to have a material impact on our operations or result in a significant gain or (loss) when recorded in the second quarter of 2017.
On February 27, 2017, we announced we were exploring strategic alternatives for our Israel API operations.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Other

Competition
Since other manufacturers of API typically do not offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as we do, the business competes on a product-by-product basis with a number of different competitors. Our API category is subject to increased price competition from other manufacturers of API located mostly in India, China, and Europe. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for information and risks associated with competition.
INFORMATION APPLICABLE TO ALL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
Research and Development
R&D is a key component of our business strategy and is performed in various locations in the countries in which we operate. While we conduct a significant amount of our own R&D, we also enter into strategic alliance agreements to obtain the rights to manufacture and/or distribute new products. R&D investments were as follows (in millions):

Year Ended | | Six Months Ended | Year Ended 
December 31, 2016 | | December 31, 2015 | December 31, 2015 | | December 27, 2014 | June 27, 2015 | | June 28, 2014
$ | 184.0 | | $ | 186.3 | | $ | 88.2 | | $ | 89.8 | $ | 187.8 | $ | 152.5

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and June 28, 2014, we wrote off capitalized in-process research and development from previous acquisitions totaling $3.5 million and $6.0 million, respectively, due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for various projects. 
The year ended December 31, 2016 included R&D expense related to clinical trial expenses primarily in our CHCA and RX segments. The year ended December 31, 2015 included incremental R&D expense due to the Omega acquisition, and clinical trial expenses primarily in our CHCA and RX segments. The six months ended December 31, 2015 included incremental R&D expense due to the Omega acquisition. The six months ended December 27, 2014 included a $10.0 million payment made in connection with our entry into a collaboration arrangement. The year ended June 27, 2015 also included incremental R&D expense due to the Omega acquisition, as well as the payment made in relation to the collaboration arrangement noted above, and an R&D contractual arrangement under which we funded $18.0 million of R&D. The year ended June 28, 2014 included incremental R&D expense attributable to the Sergeant's Pet Care Products, Inc. ("Sergeant's") and Velcera Inc. ("Velcera") acquisitions that closed during the previous year, as well as R&D expense related to the ELND005 Phase 2 clinical program in collaboration with Transition Therapeutics, Inc. ("Transition"), which we acquired from Elan. We ended our collaboration with Transition during the third quarter of the year ended June 28, 2014 and are no longer responsible for ongoing development activities and costs associated with ELND005. 
We anticipate that R&D expenditures will increase in dollar terms but will remain relatively flat to slightly higher as a percentage of net sales for the foreseeable future as we continue to cultivate our presence in the Rx-to-OTC switch and generic pharmaceutical markets, and develop our internal R&D capabilities. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks associated with innovation and R&D.
Trademarks and Patents
While we own certain trademarks and patents, neither our business as a whole, nor any of our segments, is materially dependent upon our ownership of any one trademark, or patent, or group of trademarks or patents.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Materials Sourcing
Affordable high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of our business units due to the nature of the products we manufacture. Raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers. Supplies of certain raw materials, bulk tablets, and components are limited, as they are available from one or only a few suppliers. While we have the ability to manufacture and supply certain API for our OTC and Rx products, an increasing number of components and finished goods are purchased rather than manufactured because of temporary production limitations, FDA restrictions, economic conditions, or other factors.
Historically, we have been able to react effectively to situations that require alternate sourcing. Should such alternate sourcing be necessary, FDA requirements placed on products approved through the ANDA or NDA process could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate source and adversely affect financial results. We believe we have good, cooperative working relationships with substantially all of our suppliers and have historically been able to capitalize on economies of scale in the purchase of materials and supplies due to our volume of purchases. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks associated with materials sourcing.
Manufacturing and Distribution
Our primary manufacturing facilities are in the U.S. We also have secondary manufacturing facilities in the U.K., Belgium, France, Germany, Austria, Israel, Mexico, Australia, and India, along with a joint venture in China. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks associated with our manufacturing facilities. We supplement our production capabilities with the purchase of products from outside sources. The capacity of some facilities may be fully utilized at certain times for various reasons, such as customer demand, the seasonality of the cough/cold/flu, allergy, or flea and tick seasons, and new product launches. We may utilize available capacity by performing contract manufacturing for other companies. We have logistics facilities in the U.S., Israel, Mexico, Australia, and numerous locations throughout Europe. We use contract freight and common carriers to deliver our products.
Significant Customers
Our primary customer base aligns with the concentration of large drug retailers in the current global retail drug industry marketplace. Walmart is our largest customer and accounted for the following percentage of consolidated sales:

Year Ended | | Six Months Ended | | Year Ended 
December 31, 2016 | | December 31, 2015 | | December 31, 2015 | December 27, 2014 | | June 27, 2015 | | June 28, 2014
13 | % | | 14 | % | 13 | % | | 19 | % | 16 | % | 19 | %

 Sales to Walmart are primarily in the CHCA segment. As a percentage of our total U.S. OTC sales, our sales to Walmart generally align with Walmart's U.S. retail market share in the products we sell to them. In addition, while no other customer individually comprises more than 10% of net sales, we do have other significant customers. We believe we generally have good relationships with all of our customers. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks associated with customers.
Environmental
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. We have made, and continue to make, expenditures necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws, but do not believe that the costs for complying with such laws and regulations have been or will be material to our business. We do not have any material remediation liabilities outstanding.
While we believe that climate change could present risks to our business, including increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, physical risks to our facilities, water limitations, and disruptions to our supply chain, we do not believe these risks are material to our business in the near term.

Corporate Social Responsibility
We are committed to doing business in an ethical manner. We have a long history of environmentally sound and efficient operations, safe and healthy working conditions, and active participation in the communities where we are located. As reflected in our Corporate Social Responsibility Commitment Statement available on our website, we remain committed to:

• | Helping consumers access safe, effective and affordable healthcare products;


• | Strong corporate governance;


• | Complying with regulatory and legal requirements;


• | Demonstrating environmental stewardship;


• | Continuously improving packaging sustainability;


• | Protecting human rights of our global employees and challenging our partners to do the same;


• | Diversity of thought, experience and perspective;


• | Providing a safe and healthy work environment for our employees; and


• | Establishing effective community partnerships.

Through these efforts, we strive to minimize our impact on the environment, drive responsible business practices, and ensure the welfare of our employees, their families, and the communities in which we operate now and into the future.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICING
The manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distributing, advertising, and sale of our products are subject to regulation by a variety of agencies in the localities in which our products are sold. In addition, we manufacture and market certain of our products in accordance with standards set by various organizations. We believe that our policies, operations, and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations to which we are subject. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for related risks.
United States Regulation
U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
The FDA has jurisdiction over our Rx, OTC drug products, API, and Infant Formula Foods. The FDA’s jurisdiction extends to the manufacturing, testing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, and promotion of these products. We are committed to consistently providing our customers with high quality products that adhere to "current Good Manufacturing Practices" ("cGMP") regulations promulgated by the FDA.
OTC and Rx Pharmaceuticals 
All facilities where Rx and OTC products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored, or distributed for the U.S. market must comply with FDA cGMPs and regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries, states and localities where the facilities are located. All of our drug products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored, and distributed according to cGMP regulations. The FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that our facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. 
Many of our OTC products are regulated under the OTC monograph system and subject to certain FDA regulations. Under this system, selected OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the approval of an ANDA or NDA prior to marketing. Products marketed under the OTC monograph system must conform to specific quality, formula, and labeling requirements, including permitted indications, required warnings and precautions, allowable combinations of ingredients, and dosage levels. It is generally less costly to develop and bring to market a product regulated under the OTC monograph system. 
            We also market generic prescription drugs and non-prescription products that have switched from prescription to OTC status. Prior to commercial marketing, these products require approval by the FDA of an ANDA or NDA that provides information on chemistry, manufacturing controls, clinical safety, efficacy and/or bioequivalence, packaging, and labeling. While the development process for these drugs generally requires less 
 19

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

time and expense than the development process of a new drug, the size and duration of required studies can vary greatly. Prior to the onset of the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (“GDUFA”), the FDA approval of generic drug applications took approximately three to five times longer than approval of innovator drugs. Median ANDA approval times were reported at approximately 48 months. Pursuant to GDUFA, beginning October 1, 2016, year five of the program, the FDA pledged to complete a first cycle review on 90% of electronic generic applications within 10 months of submission. The FDA has ceased reporting median ANDA approval times, however the generic industry has observed continued progress in FDA performance towards reducing ANDA approval times.
Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended ("FFDCA") (the Hatch-Waxman amendments), a company submitting an NDA can obtain a three-year period of marketing exclusivity for a prescription or OTC product if it performs a clinical study that is essential to FDA approval. Longer periods of exclusivity are possible for new chemical entities, orphan drugs (those designated under section 526 of the FFDCA) and drugs under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act. During this exclusivity period, the FDA cannot approve any ANDAs for a similar or equivalent generic product, which can preclude another party from marketing a similar product during this period. A company may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if it conducts pediatric studies requested by the FDA on the product. This exclusivity can delay both the FDA approval and sales of certain products.
A company may be entitled to a 180-day generic exclusivity period for certain products. This exclusivity period often follows a patent certification and litigation process whereby the product innovator may sue for infringement. The legal action does not ordinarily result in material damages, but it generally triggers a statutorily mandated delay in FDA approval of the ANDA for a period of up to 30 months from when the innovator was notified of the patent challenge. 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ("FDASIA") was signed into law on July 9, 2012. The law established, among other things, new user fee statutes for generic drugs and biosimilars, FDA authority concerning drug shortages, changes to enhance the FDA's inspection authority of the drug supply chain, and a limited extension of the 30-month stay provision described above. The FDASIA also reduced the time required for FDA responses to generic-blocking citizen petitions. We implemented new systems and processes to comply with the new facility self-identification and user fee requirements of the FDASIA, and we monitor facility self-identification and fee payment compliance to mitigate the risk of potential supply chain interruptions or delays in regulatory approval of new applications.
The U.S. government's Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act ("DSCSA") requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period. The serialization of all Rx products distributed in the U.S. needs to be completed by November 27, 2017, with the requirement for tracking the products commencing on November 27, 2023. Requirements for the tracing of products at the lot level through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain went into effect on January 1, 2015 for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and re-packagers, and on July 1, 2015 for dispensers. 
Infant Formula and Foods 
The FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is responsible for the regulation of infant formula. The Office of Nutrition, Labeling and Dietary Supplements ("ONLDS") has labeling responsibility for infant formula, while the Office of Food Additive Safety ("OFAS") has program responsibility for food ingredients and packaging. The ONLDS evaluates whether an infant formula manufacturer has met the requirements under the FFDCA and consults with the OFAS regarding the safety of ingredients in infant formula and of packaging materials for infant formula.
All manufacturers of pediatric nutrition products must begin with safe food ingredients, which are either generally recognized as safe or approved as food additives. The Infant Formula Act provides specific requirements for infant formula to ensure the safety and nutrition of infant formulas, including minimum and, in some cases, maximum levels of specified nutrients.
Before marketing a particular infant formula, the manufacturer must provide regulatory agencies assurance of the nutritional quality of that particular formulation consistent with the FDA’s labeling, nutrient content, and 
 20

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

manufacturer quality control requirements. A manufacturer must notify the FDA at least 90 days before the marketing of any infant formula that differs fundamentally in processing or in composition from any previous formulation produced by the manufacturer. We actively monitor this process and make the appropriate adjustments to remain in compliance with recent FDA rules regarding cGMP, quality control procedures, quality factors, notification requirements, and reports and records for the production of infant formulas.
In addition, the FFDCA requires infant formula manufacturers to test product composition during production and shelf-life; to keep records on production, testing, and distribution of each batch of infant formula; to use cGMP and quality control procedures; and to maintain records of all complaints and adverse events, some of which may reveal the possible existence of a health hazard. The FDA conducts yearly inspections of all facilities that manufacture infant formula, inspects new facilities during early production runs, and collects and analyzes samples of infant formula.
Our infant and toddler foods are subject to the Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA"), which protects the safety of U.S. foods by mandating comprehensive, prevention-based controls within the food industry. Under FSMA, the FDA has mandatory recall authority for all food products and greater authority to inspect food producers and is taking steps toward product tracing to enable more efficient product source identification in the event of a safety issue. 
Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients
We develop and manufacture API in Israel and India for export to the U.S. and other global markets. Before API can be commercialized in the U.S., we must submit a drug master file ("DMF") that provides the proprietary information related to the manufacturing process. The FDA inspects the manufacturing facilities to assess cGMP compliance, and the facilities and procedures must be cGMP compliant before API may be exported to the U.S. 
The facilities and products are subject to regulation by the applicable regulatory bodies in the place of manufacture as well as the regulatory agency in the country from which the product is exported or imported. Our Israeli facility has been approved by the U.S. FDA, Israel Ministry of Health ("IMOH"), Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks of Mexico, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency of Japan, and the Korean Food and Drug Administration and has received GMP certification from IMOH. Our India facility has been inspected by the U.S. FDA and has received GMP certification from the Indian FDA.
For API exported to European markets, we submit a European DMF and, where applicable, obtain a certificate of suitability from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines. The manufacturing facilities and production procedures for API marketed in Europe must meet EU-GMP and European Pharmacopeia standards. 
U.S. Department of Agriculture
The Organic Foods Production Act enacted under Title 21 of the 1990 Farm Bill established uniform national standards for the production and handling of foods labeled as "organic." Our infant formula manufacturing sites in Vermont and Ohio adhere to the standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") National Organic Program for production, handling, and processing to maintain the integrity of organic products. Our infant formula manufacturing sites in Vermont and Ohio are USDA-certified, enabling them to produce and label organic products for U.S. and Canadian markets.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is the main regulatory body in the United States for veterinary pesticides. The EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of pesticide products applied to animals. All manufacturers of animal health pesticides must show that their products will not cause “unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment” as stated in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Within the United States, pesticide products that are approved by the EPA must also be approved by individual state pesticide authorities before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances, such as morphine, hydromorphone, opium, testosterone, midazolam, and List I chemicals, such as pseudoephedrine, pursuant to the federal Controlled Substances Act ("CSA"). The CSA and DEA regulations impose registration, security, record keeping, reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements upon legitimate handlers under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA categorizes controlled substances into Schedules I, II, III, IV, or V, with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. We are subject to the requirements regarding the controlled substances in Schedules II - V and the List I chemicals. Our facilities that manufacture, distribute, import, or export any controlled substances must register annually with the DEA.
The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, record keeping, reporting, and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration, and it also periodically inspects facilities for compliance with the CSA and its regulations. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action, such as civil penalties, refusal to renew necessary registration, or the initiation of proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution. We are also subject to state legislation regulating the manufacture and distribution of certain products.
Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Other Drug Pricing Programs 

U.S. law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having federal funds being made available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, enter into three government pricing program agreements: (i) a Medicaid rebate agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program; (ii) a 340B program agreement with the Secretary of HHS to provide discounts to certain “covered entity” safety net health care providers; and (iii) a Master Agreement with the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") under which discounts are available for purchases by federal agencies. We have such agreements in effect. 
The Medicaid rebate agreement requires the drug manufacturer to remit rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis for both fee-for-service and Medicaid managed care organization utilization. Rebate amounts are based on pricing data reported by the manufacturer to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), including Average Manufacturer Price ("AMP") and, in the case of innovator products, Best Price ("BP"). U.S. law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program report average sales price ("ASP") information to CMS for each calendar quarter for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B.
Under the Medicaid rebate program, the minimum rebate amounts due are as follows: (i) for noninnovator products, in general generic drugs marketed under ANDAs, the rebate amount is 13% of the AMP for the quarter; and (ii) for innovator products, in general brand-name products marketed under NDAs, the rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the AMP for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the BP for that same quarter. Manufacturers also pay an “additional rebate" on innovator drugs where price increases since launch have outpaced inflation. Beginning with the first quarter of 2017, an additional rebate is due for noninnovator products, which is calculated somewhat differently from the innovator product additional rebate.
CMS issued a final regulation, generally effective April 1, 2016, to implement changes to the Medicaid rebate program under the 2010 health reform legislation (“Health Reform Law”) and otherwise to program guidance. In addition to this guidance concerning rebate program administration matters, the regulation also addressed certain related Medicaid reimbursement matters. First, under the Health Reform Law, CMS has also begun to use manufacturer AMP data to calculate reimbursement limits for pharmacies for multiple source drugs under the Medicaid program, known as the federal upper limit ("FUL"). CMS also surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis for comparing their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. Second, the regulation also directs states to update their Medicaid payment methodologies to provide for payment amounts designed to reflect pharmacies’ actual acquisition costs for drugs and to provide the government with findings to support their compliance with this standard.

Pricing and rebate calculations are governed by statutory and regulatory requirements that are complex, vary among products and programs, can change over time, and are subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. In the case of the Medicaid rebate program, if we become aware of errors in our prior price submissions, or a prior BP submission needs to be updated due to late arriving data, we must resubmit the updated data within specified time frames. Such restatements and recalculations increase our cost of compliance with the Medicaid rebate program, and corrections can result in an overage or underage of our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction.
The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The ceiling price is derived from the data the manufacturer reports under the Medicaid rebate program and therefore any changes to statutory or regulatory requirements applicable to the Medicaid price figures may impact the 340B ceiling price calculation as well. 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. 
U.S. law also requires any company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program and Medicare Part B and that wants its covered drugs paid for by certain federal agencies and grantees to enter into a Master Agreement with the VA. Under the Master Agreement, the company must offer its innovator drugs for procurement under the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) pricing program, and must charge certain agencies (VA, Department of Defense, Public Health Service and the Coast Guard) no more than a statutory Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”). The FCP is calculated based on Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“NFAMP”) data we submit to the VA. FSS contracts include extensive disclosure and certification requirements and standard government terms and conditions with which we must comply. Consistent with VA’s interpretation of the Master Agreement, we have also entered into an agreement to pay rebates on covered drug prescriptions dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Operations for risks related to the above-mentioned programs.
Other U.S. Regulations and Organizations
We are subject to various other national, state, non-governmental, and local agency rules and regulations. Compliance with the laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our current products and the discovery, development, and introduction of new products requires substantial effort, expense and capital investment. Other regulatory agencies, organizations and legislation that may impact our business include, but are not limited to: 

• | Physician Payment Sunshine Act - This act requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, maintenance of a payment database and public reporting of the payment data.


• | Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA") - This act and other similar anti-bribery laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage.


• | Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") - This agency oversees the advertising and other promotional practices of consumer products marketers. The FTC considers whether a product’s claims are substantiated, truthful and not misleading. The FTC also reviews mergers and acquisitions of companies exceeding specified thresholds and investigates certain business practices relevant to the healthcare industry.


• | International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") - The ISO Standards specify requirements for a Quality Management System that demonstrates the ability to consistently provide products that meet customer and applicable regulatory standards and includes processes to ensure continuous improvement. Our infant formula manufacturing sites are ISO 9001-2008 Certified for Quality Management Systems. ISO inspections are conducted at least annually.

Regulation


• | United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. ("USP") - The USP is a non-governmental, standard-setting organization. By reference, the FFDCA incorporates the USP quality and testing standards and monographs as the standard that must be met for the listed drugs, unless compliance with those standards is specifically disclaimed on the product’s labeling. USP standards exist for most Rx and OTC pharmaceuticals and many nutritional supplements. The FDA typically requires USP compliance as part of cGMP compliance.


• | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") - We could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA.


• | Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") - The CPSC has published regulations requiring child resistant packaging on certain products including pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. The manufacturer of any product that is subject to any CPSC rule, ban, standard or regulation must certify that, based on a reasonable testing program, the product complies with CPSC requirements.


• | Other State Agencies - We are subject to regulation by numerous other state health departments, insurance departments, boards of pharmacy, state controlled substance agencies, state consumer health and safety regulations, and other comparable state agencies, each of which have license requirements and fees that vary by state.

Regulation Outside the U.S. 
We develop and manufacture products and market third-party manufactured products in regions outside the U.S., including Eastern and Western Europe, Israel, Mexico, Australia, countries in Asia, South America, the Middle East, and Russia, each of which has its own regulatory environment. The majority of our sales outside the U.S. are in the following categories: OTC/Rx pharmaceuticals, medical devices, dietary supplements and cosmetics.
European Union
OTC and Rx Pharmaceuticals 
The European pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated and much of the legislative and regulatory framework is driven by the European Parliament and the European Commission. This has many benefits, including the potential to harmonize standards across the complex European market. However, obtaining regulatory agreement across member states presents complex challenges that can lead to delays in the regulatory process. 
In the European Union (“EU”), as well as many other locations around the world, the manufacture and sale of medicinal products is regulated in a manner substantially similar to that of the U.S. requirements, which generally prohibit the handling, manufacture, marketing, and importation of any medicinal product unless it is properly registered in accordance with applicable law. The registration file relating to any particular product must contain data related to product efficacy and safety, including results of clinical testing and/or references to medical publications, as well as detailed information regarding production methods and quality control. Health ministries are authorized to cancel the registration of a product if it is found to be harmful or ineffective or if it is manufactured or marketed other than in accordance with registration conditions.
Between 1995 and 1998, the over-arching legislation that governs medicinal products was revised in an attempt to simplify and harmonize product registration. This revised legislation introduced the mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”), whereby after approval of a marketing authorization by regulatory authorities in the reference member state (“RMS”), additional marketing authorizations could be submitted to other concerned member states to obtain a product license. In November 2005, the medicinal product legislation was further revised to introduce the decentralized procedure (“DCP”) whereby marketing authorizations are submitted simultaneously to the RMS and select concerned member states. In 2005, the EMA also opened up the centralized procedure to sponsors of marketing authorizations for generic medicinal products. Unlike the MRP and DCP, the centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization and product labeling across all member states that will allow a sponsor to file for individual country reimbursement and make the medicine available in all the EU countries listed on the application.

Regulation

Marketing authorizations and subsequent product licenses are granted to applicants only after the relevant health authority issues a positive assessment of quality, safety and efficacy of the product. 
In addition to obtaining marketing authorization for each product, all member states require that a manufacturer’s facilities obtain approval from an EU Regulatory Authority. The EU has a code of GMP that each manufacturer must follow and comply with. Regulatory authorities in the EU may conduct inspections of the manufacturing facilities to review procedures, operating systems, and personnel qualifications. We believe that our policies, operations and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations to which our operations are subject.
EU Member States had to transpose the European Falsified Medicines Directive (the “Directive”) into national law by January 2, 2013. The transposition process is now complete. The provisions of the Directive are intended to reduce the risk of counterfeit medicines entering the supply chain and also to ensure the quality of API manufactured outside of the EU. The Directive required the serialization of all Rx and some OTC products, similar to the DSCSA in the U.S.
In the EU, member states regulate the pricing of prescription medicinal products, and in some cases, the formulation and dosing of products. This regulation is handled by individual member state national health services. These individual regulatory bodies can result in considerable price differences and product availability among member states. The implementation of tendering systems for the pricing of pharmaceuticals in several countries generally impacts drug pricing for generics; generally “tendering” refers to a system that requires bids to be submitted to the government by competing manufacturers to be the exclusive, or one of a few, suppliers of a product in a particular country.
Data exclusivity provisions exist in many countries, although the application is not uniform. In general, these exclusivity provisions prevent the approval and/or submission of generic drug applications to the health authorities for a fixed period of time following the first approval of the brand-name product in that country. As these exclusivity provisions operate independently of patent exclusivity, they may prevent the submission of generic drug applications for some products even after the patent protection has expired.
The requirements deriving from European pharmacovigilance legislation are constantly expanding due to increasing guidance on good vigilance practices and increased communication on inspectors’ expectations. Pharmacovigilance fee legislation became effective in late 2014 to support health authority assessment of pharmacovigilance safety evaluation reports, study protocols for post authorization safety studies and referrals. Once approved, the advertising of pharmaceuticals in the EU is governed by national regulations and guidelines. Within certain member states this is overseen by a self-certification process whereas in others national governance bodies approve material prior to release.
The wholesale distribution of medicinal products is an important activity in the integrated supply chain management. The quality and the integrity of medicinal products can be affected by a lack of adequate control. To this end, the EU Commission has published guidelines on Good Distribution Practice of medicinal products for human use in 2013. The present guidelines are based on Articles 84 and 85b(3) of medicinal products for human use directive. 
Medical Devices
The EU has enacted into law numerous directives and adopted many harmonizing standards pertaining to a wide range of industrial products, including medical devices. Medical devices that comply with the requirements of applicable directives are entitled to bear the CE marking of conformity, which indicates that the device conforms to the applicable requirements of the directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a Notified Body, an organization accredited by a member state. Assessment by a Notified Body includes an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and may also include specific testing of the product. This assessment is a prerequisite for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU. 
Dietary Supplements 
 25

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1
Regulation

Dietary supplements are subject to several regulations that inform the selection of ingredient levels and how products can be described on packaging and in advertising. These regulations include: Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC, Food Information to Consumers Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011, Permitted Vitamins and Minerals Regulation (EC) 1170/2009, Food Additives Regulation (EC) 1333/2008, and Nutritional & Health Claims Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and starting in July 2016, the Foods Intended for Particular Nutritional Uses Directive 2009/39/EC & Regulation (EU) 609/2013.
EU rules on nutrition and health claims, which were established by Regulation EC 1924/2006, apply to any nutritional or health claim by a manufacturer. The objective of the regulation is to ensure that claims made in food labeling or advertising are clear, accurate and based on scientific evidence. The European Food Safety Authority, an advisory panel to the European Commission, performs all scientific assessments of health claims on food and supplement labels. An EU register of nutrition and health claims exists to document approved, pending, and rejected claims. 
Cosmetics
Cosmetic products in the EU market must comply with Regulation EC No. 1223/2009. This regulation requires manufacturers to prepare a product safety report prior to placing a cosmetic product in the market. In addition, for each cosmetic product placed in the market, a “responsible person” must be designated to oversee compliance with the regulation’s reporting requirements. Commission Regulation EU No. 655/2013 establishes the common criteria and justification for claims to be used in the packaging and advertising of cosmetics products.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 12,800 full-time and temporary employees worldwide of which a small portion of employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations generally satisfactory.
