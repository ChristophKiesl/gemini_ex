ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business




European Sustainable Growth Acquisition Corp. (“we”, “EUSG” or the “Company”) is a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on November 10, 2020. We were incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). We are not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. We are an early stage and emerging growth company. On January 26, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “IPO” or “Initial Public Offering”) of 12,500,000 units (the “Units”). On January 27, 2021, we issued an additional 1,875,000 Units pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option in full. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class A Ordinary Shares”), and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), with each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $143,750,000. On December 22, 2021, we merged with and into EUSG II Corporation as part of the Transactions (as defined below) and are no longer in existence.
The Business Combination with ADS-TEC Energy




On August 10, 2021, as disclosed in our Form 8-K filed on August 11, 2021, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”) with (i) ads-tec Energy plc, an Irish public limited company duly incorporated under the laws of Ireland and our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Irish Holdco”), (ii) EUSG II Corporation, an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability under company number 379118 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Irish Holdco (“New SPAC”), (iii) Bosch Thermotechnik GmbH, based in Wetzlar and entered in the commercial register of the Wetzlar Local Court under HRB 13 (“Bosch”), (iv) ads-tec Holding GmbH, based in Nürtingen and entered in the commercial register of the Stuttgart Local Court under HRB 224527 (“ADSH”, together with Bosch, the “Sellers” and each individually, a “Seller”), and (v) ads-tec Energy GmbH, based in Nürtingen and entered in the commercial register of the Stuttgart Local Court under HRB 762810 (“ADSE”), pursuant to which, (i) the Company would merge with and into New SPAC, with New SPAC being the surviving company in such merger (the “SPAC Merger”), (ii) following the SPAC Merger, Bosch would transfer to Irish Holdco, and Irish Holdco would acquire from Bosch certain shares of ADSE in exchange for the Cash Consideration (the “Bosch Acquisition”), and (iii) concurrently with the Bosch Acquisition, the Sellers would transfer as contribution to Irish Holdco, and Irish Holdco would assume from the Sellers, certain shares of ADSE in exchange for the Share Consideration (the “Share-for-Share Exchange” and, together with the SPAC Merger, the Bosch Acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and the Transaction Documents, the “Transactions” or the “Business Combination”).





Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, certain investors (the “PIPE Investors”) entered into share subscription agreements, pursuant to which the PIPE Investors committed to subscribe for and purchase 15.6 million newly issued Class A Ordinary Shares (the “Private Placement”) for gross proceeds of approximately $156 million. The Private Placement closed on December 21, 2021.



On December 22, 2021, we completed the Transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and are no longer in existence.




Emerging Growth Company




We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved, If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.




In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
