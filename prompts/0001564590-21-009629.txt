ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
GENERAL
 We design, manufacture, market and distribute a wide variety of fiber-based products, including communication papers, specialty and packaging papers. The foundation of our business is a network of wood fiber converting assets that produce paper grade, fluff and specialty pulp. Approximately 40% of our pulp production is consumed internally to manufacture paper, with the balance sold as market pulp. We are the largest integrated marketer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America serving a variety of customers, including merchants, retail outlets, stationers, printers, publishers, converters and end-users.

 Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise specified, “Domtar Corporation,” “the Company,” “Domtar,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Domtar Corporation, its subsidiaries, as well as its investments.
 2020 was a year of significant challenges for Domtar. During 2020, we undertook various strategic initiatives, including a cost reduction program, executed on our asset conversion roadmap, reviewed our strategic alternatives for our Personal Care business and faced unprecedented operating and market challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 While our strategy will take some time to execute, we made good progress in 2020 that provides us with a strong foundation on which to build. We are executing on a clear plan to create long-term shareholder value by refocusing our portfolio around Paper, Pulp and Packaging. We also have begun to execute our strategic plan to enter the containerboard market with highly competitive assets and a differentiated go-to-market strategy. 
 Sale of Personal Care business
 On January 7, 2021, we agreed to sell our Personal Care business to American Industrial Partners (AIP), for a purchase price of $920 million in cash (the “Transaction”). The Transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. Based on its magnitude and because we are exiting the Personal Care business, the sale represents a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on our operations and financial results. Accordingly, all periods presented reflect the Personal Care business as a discontinued operation. Our Personal Care business was previously disclosed as a separate reportable segment. For more information on our discontinued operations, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 3, “Discontinued Operations”. 
 
Execution of our asset conversion roadmap
 On August 7, 2020, we announced our decision to repurpose assets at our Kingsport, Tennessee and Ashdown, Arkansas, facilities, following a review of our manufacturing footprint. This conversion program is consistent with the roadmap that we made public in 2018. The previously announced multi-mill conversion roadmap is designed to adjust our paper capacity to align with our customer demand. Through this process, we have identified up to four large scale paper machine/mill repurposing projects that can produce 2.5 million tons of containerboard and/or 570,000 ADMT of additional market softwood and fluff pulp. We plan to enter the linerboard market with the conversion of our Kingsport paper machine. Once in full operation, the mill will produce and market approximately 600,000 tons annually of high-quality recycled linerboard and medium, providing us with a strategic footprint in a growing adjacent market. The conversion is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect to complete the conversion of our Ashdown mill to 100% softwood and fluff pulp in early 2021. The Ashdown mill will produce additional market hardwood pulp until it converts the fiberline to softwood pulp. The conversion of the fiberline to 100% softwood is necessary for an eventual expansion into containerboard. Following the fiberline conversion, Ashdown will have annual production capacity of 775,000 tons of fluff and softwood pulp. 
 
Cost reduction program
 On August 7, 2020, we announced the implementation of a cost reduction program, targeting $200 million in annual run-rate cost savings to be realized by the end of 2021. The goal of the program is to build a stronger business operation, enhance our cost efficiency, improve operating margins and maximize productivity and cash flow. For more information on our cost reduction program, refer to “Cost Reduction Program” section included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
Purchase of Appvion Point of Sale business
 On April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of the Point of Sale paper business from Appvion Operations, Inc. The business includes the coater and related equipment located at Appvion’s West Carrollton, Ohio, facility as well as a license for all corresponding intellectual property. The results of this business have been included in the consolidated financial statements as of April 27, 2020. For more information, refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 4 “Acquisition of Business”.

COVID-19
 First identified in people in late 2019, COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the world and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. With the unprecedented and rapid spread of COVID-19 and social distancing measures implemented throughout the world due to the pandemic, this virus has had a profound impact on human health, the global economy and society in general. We are actively monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business, including our employees, operations, customers, suppliers, liquidity and capital resources. The health and safety of our employees and customers remains our top priority.
 
Prior to mid-March 2020, our results were largely in line with expectations. We began to experience a decline in shipment of paper in March 2020, when volume declined in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions. Overall, for 2020, our paper shipments were lower by approximately 19% when compared to 2019. COVID-19 is discussed in more detail under the COVID-19 section of the Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

PULP AND PAPER
 
Our Manufacturing Operations
 We produce approximately 3.8 million metric tons of softwood, fluff and hardwood pulp at 11 mills. Approximately 40% of our pulp is consumed internally to manufacture paper, with the balance being sold as market pulp. We also purchase limited papergrade pulp from third parties for specific grades and to optimize the logistics of our pulp capacity while reducing transportation costs.
 We are the largest integrated manufacturer and marketer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. We have seven integrated pulp and paper mills (five in the United States and two in Canada), with an annual paper production capacity of approximately 2.2 million tons of uncoated freesheet paper. Our paper manufacturing operations are supported by 11 converting and forms manufacturing operations (including a network of 9 plants located offsite from our paper making operations). Approximately 68% of our paper production capacity is in the United States and 32% is located in Canada.
 We produce market pulp in excess of our internal requirements at our pulp and paper mills in Espanola, Hawesville, Windsor, Marlboro and Nekoosa. We also produce papergrade, fluff and specialty pulps at our four stand-alone pulp mills in Ashdown, Kamloops, Dryden and Plymouth. We can sell approximately 2.1 million metric tons of pulp per year depending on market conditions. Approximately 58% of our pulp production capacity is in the U.S. and 42% is in Canada.
 The table below lists our operating pulp and paper mills and their annual production capacity:

Our Raw Materials
 The manufacturing of pulp and paper requires wood fiber, chemicals and energy. We discuss these three major raw materials used in our manufacturing operations below.
 Wood Fiber
 United States pulp and paper mills
 The fiber used by our pulp and paper mills in the U.S. is softwood and hardwood, both readily available in the market from multiple third-party sources. The mills obtain fiber from a variety of sources, depending on their location. These sources include a combination of supply contracts, wood lot management arrangements, advance stumpage purchases and spot market purchases.
 Canadian pulp and paper mills
 The fiber used at our Windsor pulp and paper mill is hardwood originating from a variety of sources, including purchases on the open market in Canada and the U.S., contracts with Quebec wood producers’ marketing boards, public land where we have wood supply allocations and from Domtar’s private lands. The softwood and hardwood fiber for our Espanola pulp and paper mill and the softwood fiber for our Dryden pulp mill are obtained from third parties, directly or indirectly from public lands and through designated wood supply allocations. The fiber used at our Kamloops pulp mill is all softwood, originating mostly from third-party sawmill operations in the southern-interior part of British Columbia.
 Cutting rights on public lands related to our pulp and paper mills in Canada represent about 1.7 million cubic meters of softwood and 0.8 million cubic meters of hardwood per year. Access to harvesting of fiber on public lands in Ontario and Quebec is subject to licenses and review by the respective governmental authorities.
 Chemicals
 We use various chemical compounds in our pulp and paper manufacturing operations that we purchase, primarily on a centralized basis, through contracts varying between one and ten years in length to ensure product availability. Most of the contracts have pricing that fluctuates based on prevailing market conditions. For pulp manufacturing, we use numerous chemicals including caustic soda, sodium chlorate, sulfuric acid, lime and peroxide. For paper manufacturing, we also use several chemical products including starch, precipitated calcium carbonate, optical brighteners, dyes and aluminum sulfate.
Energy
 Our operations produce and consume substantial amounts of energy. Our primary energy sources include: biomass, natural gas and electricity. Approximately 73% of the total energy required to manufacture our products comes from renewable fuels such as bark and spent pulping liquor, generated as byproducts from our manufacturing processes. The remainder of the energy comes from smaller amounts of other fossil fuels and purchased steam procured under supply contracts. Under most of these contracts, suppliers are committed to provide quantities within predetermined ranges that provide us with our needs for a particular type of fuel at a specific facility. Most of these contracts have pricing that fluctuate based on prevailing market conditions. Biomass and fossil fuels are consumed primarily to produce steam that is used in the manufacturing process and, to a lesser extent, to provide direct heat used in the chemical recovery process.
 We have cogenerating assets at all of our integrated pulp and paper mills, as well as hydro assets at three locations: Espanola, Nekoosa and Rothschild. These generating assets produce approximately 71% of the electricity requirements of our manufacturing operations, with the balance supplied from local utilities. Electricity is primarily used to drive motors, pumps and other equipment, as well as provide lighting.  
 Our Transportation
 Transportation of raw materials, wood fiber, chemicals and pulp into our mills is mostly done by rail and trucks, although barges are used in certain circumstances. We rely on third parties for the transportation of our pulp and paper products between our mills, converting operations, distribution centers and customers. Our paper products are shipped mostly by truck, with logistics operations and procurement being managed centrally in collaboration with each location. Our pulp is either shipped by vessel, rail or truck depending on destination and customer preference. We work with major railroads, ocean carriers, and approximately 300 trucking and third- party transportation companies in the U.S. and Canada. Service agreements are typically negotiated on an annual basis. We pay diesel fuel surcharges, which vary depending on the mode of transportation used and the cost of diesel fuel.

The majority of our customers purchase products through individual purchase orders. In 2020, approximately 75% of our sales were in the United States, 9% were in Canada, and 16% were in other countries.
OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND FINANCIAL PRIORITIES
 As a leading fiber-based technology company, Domtar is focused on driving innovation, enhancing our operating platforms, and delivering high quality products. To further bolster our position and drive enhanced value for our stockholders, Domtar is focused on four key business objectives: (1) driving value through strategic investment; (2) building on our core competencies in wood fiber to diversify and expand Domtar’s footprint in growth markets and industries; (3) maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation that allows for investments in growth opportunities and rewards stockholders with capital returns; and (4) operating with a focus on environmental responsibility and sustainability. We are confident that the continued focus on these objectives will bolster the competitive position of our business and drive value for our stakeholders, including stockholders, customers and employees.
 Driving value. Fiber-based products remain the primary part of our growth plan, and we have strategies and operating priorities designed to maximize the value of the business. Our key priorities include: increasing productivity in our pulp business, pursuing new sources of paper consumption, pursuing asset repurposing opportunities and operating an optimal portfolio of strategic assets. We believe that execution on these priorities will enable Domtar to expand into complementary growth areas and protect its market position in Pulp and Paper.
 Expanding into areas of growth and leveraging our fiber expertise. We are focused on optimizing and expanding our operations in markets with positive demand dynamics through investments for organic growth, the repurposing of assets and strategic acquisitions. Domtar has a history of proactively adapting to changing market conditions, and today, we are repositioning the Company towards areas of growth. We are well positioned to capitalize on new opportunities in the wood fiber market. The Company already has the financial resources, infrastructure, raw materials, technologies and expertise necessary to deliver new products. We believe that we have built a strong foundation for diversification and continue to make important, but disciplined, progress. 
 Maintaining a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation that allows for investments in growth opportunities and rewards stockholders with capital returns. We believe in a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation, and we are committed to deploying capital only to the areas that will achieve the best possible return for our stockholders. Domtar’s free cash flow allows us to invest in growth opportunities and maintain a strong and flexible financial position for operating and strategic 
 9


initiatives, while still returning capital to our stockholders. To continue generating free cash flow, we are focused on allocating our capital expenditures effectively and minimizing working capital requirements by reducing discretionary spending, reviewing procurement costs and pursuing the balance of production and inventory control.
 Operating responsibly on behalf of all of Domtar’s stakeholders. We try to make a positive difference every day by pursuing sustainable growth, valuing relationships, and responsibly managing our resources. We aim to care for our customers, end-users and stakeholders in the communities where we operate, all seeking assurances that resources are managed in a sustainable manner. We strive to provide these assurances by certifying our distribution and manufacturing operations and measuring our performance against internationally recognized benchmarks. Domtar is committed to the responsible use of forest resources across our operations, and we are enrolled in programs and initiatives to encourage landowners to pursue certification to improve their market access and increase their revenue opportunities. We believe that each of these initiatives also creates value for our stockholders and is part of our larger business strategy and commitment to environmental sustainability. 
 OUR COMPETITION
 The markets in which our businesses operate are highly competitive with well-established domestic and foreign manufacturers.
 In the paper business, our paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas, except in highly specialized papers or customized products. In uncoated freesheet, we compete primarily on the basis of product quality, breadth of offering, service solutions and competitively priced paper products, which include an extensive offering of high quality Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”)-certified paper products. While we have a leading position in the North American uncoated freesheet market, we also compete with other paper grades, including coated freesheet, and with electronic transmission and document storage alternatives. As the use of these alternative products continues to grow, we continue to see a decrease in the overall demand for paper products. All of our pulp and paper manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S. or in Canada where we sell approximately 84% of our products. The five largest manufacturers of uncoated freesheet papers in North America (including Domtar) represent approximately 76% of total production capacity. On a global basis, there are hundreds of manufacturers that produce and sell uncoated freesheet paper. The level of competitive pressures from foreign producers in the North American market is highly dependent upon exchange rates, particularly the rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro as well as the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real.
 The pulp we sell is fluff, softwood or hardwood pulp. The pulp market is highly fragmented with many manufacturers competing worldwide. Competition is primarily on the basis of access to low-cost wood fiber, product quality and competitively priced pulp products. The fluff pulp we sell is used in absorbent products, incontinence products, diapers and feminine hygiene products. The softwood and hardwood pulp we sell is primarily slow growth northern bleached softwood and hardwood kraft, and we produce specialty engineered pulp grades with a predetermined mix of wood species. Our softwood and hardwood pulps are sold to customers that make a variety of products for specialty paper, packaging, tissue and industrial applications, and customers who make printing and writing grades. Airlaid and ultrathin laminated cores are highly customized and specialized for customer needs and have a relatively long and technical development, qualification and sales process. We also seek product differentiation through the certification of our pulp mills to the FSC chain-of-custody standard and the procurement of FSC-certified virgin fiber. All of our pulp production capacity is located in the U.S. or in Canada, and we sell approximately 54% of our pulp to other countries.
 OUR HUMAN CAPITAL 
 We have approximately 6,600 employees, 61% are employed in the United States and 39% in Canada. 57% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, generally on a facility-by-facility basis.    
 We are committed to fostering a workplace that attracts and retains talent. Through ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety, employee well-being and community engagement, we aim to directly influence positive work behavior and on-the-job performance.
 Diversity and Inclusion
 Although we have a strict non-discrimination and anti-harassment policy, we view diversity and inclusion as more than just policies and practices. It is part of who we are, how we operate, and essential to our long-term sustainability. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where people can bring their authentic selves to work and feel valued and included.
 Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled and diverse board. We are committed to increasing representation of women and underrepresented minorities at Domtar overall, but particularly in leadership roles. The Domtar Diversity and Inclusion Council, provides guidance to leadership to help make Domtar more inclusive and diverse.  
 To ensure leadership maintains a commitment to diversity and inclusion, each leader is responsible for focusing on how they can develop and support diversity within the workplace and within their scope of responsibilities. The Human Resources Committee of the Board also has ongoing oversight of diversity and inclusion programs.

Compensation and Pay Equity
 Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We believe people should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role, experience and their performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable.
Learning and Development
 Hiring, developing and retaining employees is important to our operations and we are focused on creating experiences and programs that foster growth, performance and retention. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual, social and on-site learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development. 
Health and Safety 
 The physical health, life balance and mental health of our employees is vital to Domtar’s success.  That is why we work relentlessly to physically eliminate hazards and minimize risk of injury, promote a safety culture, and invest in well-being programs to help our employees establish and maintain healthy lifestyles.
 Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees while meeting the needs of our customers. Shortly after the outset of COVID-19, we adopted enhanced safety measures and practices across our facilities to protect employee health and safety and ensured a reliable supply of essential products to our customers. We monitor the impact of the pandemic on our employees and within our operations, and proactively modify or adopt new practices to promote their health and safety.
 Community Involvement
 We make donations to charitable organizations in the communities where we live and work and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We also offer employees the opportunity to volunteer in their communities through our Domtar EarthChoice Ambassadors program. We focus our philanthropic efforts on three areas that align with our business: literacy, sustainability, and health and wellness. 
OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY
 Domtar aims to deliver value to our customers, employees, shareholders and communities by viewing our business decisions within the larger context of sustainability. We take a long-term view on managing natural resources for the future. We strive to minimize waste and encourage recycling. We aim to have the highest standards for ethical conduct, for caring about the health and safety of each other, and for maintaining the environmental quality in the communities where we live and work. We value the partnerships we have formed with non-governmental organizations and believe they make us a better company. We focus on agility to respond to new opportunities, and we are committed to turning innovation into value creation. By embracing sustainability as our operating philosophy, we seek to internalize the fact that the choices we have and the impact of the decisions we make on our stakeholders are all interconnected. We believe that our business and the people and communities who depend on us are better served as we weave this focus on sustainability into the things we do.
 Domtar executes this commitment to sustainability at every level and every location across the Company. With the support of the Board of Directors, our Management Committee empowers senior managers from manufacturing, technology, finance, sales and marketing and corporate staff functions to regularly come together and establish key sustainability performance metrics, and to routinely assess and report on progress. Our sustainability goals, challenges and progress are reported annually on the Company’s website and other published reports. 
 OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
 Our business is subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries where we have operations, relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing wood harvesting, air emissions, climate change, waste water discharges, storage, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, contaminated sites, landfill operation and closure obligations and health and safety matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in the operation of our business. We may encounter situations in which our operations fail to maintain full compliance with applicable environmental requirements, possibly leading to civil or criminal fines, penalties or enforcement actions, including those that could result in governmental or judicial orders that stop or interrupt our operations or require us to take corrective measures at substantial costs, such as the installation of additional pollution control equipment or other remedial actions.
 Compliance with environmental laws and regulations involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs. Additional information regarding environmental matters is included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 22 “Commitments and Contingencies” and in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the section of Critical accounting estimates and policies, under the caption “Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations.”
