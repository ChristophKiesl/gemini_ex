Overview
 Our vision is to delight millions of members with better health and better care while reducing the total cost of care. Our mission is to transform health care for all through our human-centered, technology-powered model. We are a membership-based primary care platform with seamless digital health and inviting in-office care, convenient to where people work, shop, live and click. We are disrupting health care from within the existing ecosystem by simultaneously addressing the frustrations and unmet needs of key stakeholders, which include consumers, employers, providers and health networks. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 549,000 members in 13 markets in the United States and more than 8,000 enterprise clients.
 The current state of the healthcare ecosystem leaves key stakeholders frustrated and with unmet needs.
  
• | Consumers. According to a 2016 report, 81% of consumers are dissatisfied with their healthcare experience, in part due to limited after-hours and digital access, long wait times for appointments, extended in-office delays, short and impersonal visits, uninviting medical offices in inconvenient locations, constrained access to specialists and a lack of care coordination across clinical settings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Employers. Employers find their health benefit offerings often underperforming on such fundamental objectives as attracting and engaging employees, improving employee productivity, reducing absenteeism, producing better health outcomes, increasing the safety of the workplace through screening and treating communicable diseases such as Covid-19, or managing healthcare costs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providers. Within primary care, according to a 2019 Mayo Clinic report, over 50% of family physicians show symptoms of burnout, driven in part by misaligned fee-for-service compensation approaches incentivizing short transactional interactions, and excessive administrative tasks associated with burdensome electronic health record (“EHR”) systems and convoluted insurance procedures.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Health Networks. Health systems and health plans have been looking to develop coordinated networks of care to better attract patients, increase attributable lives and better integrate primary care with specialty services for improved patient outcomes and lower costs. Yet even with major investments in provider groups, care management programs and technology systems, health networks have struggled to deliver on these objectives.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The U.S. primary care market is estimated to be approximately $260 billion in 2021, including approximately $170 billion for the commercially insured population. We estimate that the 13 markets in which we are physically present represent approximately $38 billion in primary care spend within the commercially insured population under age 65. While our members can access our digital services nationally, we believe we can expand our physical presence across the United States. The 50 largest metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S. represent an estimated market opportunity of approximately $80 billion within the commercially insured population under age 65. We expect our total addressable market to grow as we further expand into additional services, serve additional populations and explore alternative risk-sharing reimbursement models.
 We have developed a modernized healthcare membership model based on direct consumer enrollment as well as employer sponsorship. Our annual membership model includes seamless access to 24/7 digital health services paired with inviting in-office care routinely covered under health insurance programs. Our technology helps drive high monthly active usage within our membership, promoting ongoing and longitudinal patient relationships for better health outcomes and high member retention. Our technology also helps our service-minded team in building trust and rapport with our members by facilitating proactive digital health outreach as well as on-demand and scheduled virtual and in-office care. Our digital health services and well-appointed offices, which tend to be located in highly convenient locations, are staffed by a team of clinicians who are not paid on a fee-for-service basis, and therefore free of misaligned compensation incentives prevalent in health care. Additionally, we have developed clinically integrated partnerships with health networks, better coordinating more timely access to specialty care by members when needed, while advancing value-based care for employers through clinical and digital integration.

Together, these components of our human-centered and technology-powered model allow us to deliver better results for key stakeholders.
  
• | Consumers. We delight consumers with a superior experience as evidenced by our average Net Promoter Score, or NPS, of 90 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and our key primary care-related Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS”) quality measures. NPS measures the willingness of consumers to recommend a company’s products or services to others. We use NPS as a proxy for gauging our members’ overall satisfaction with our providers and loyalty to the One Medical brand. Our NPS is based on responses from a single question survey provided to members after in-office visits which asks members how likely they are to recommend their One Medical provider to a friend or colleague. We calculate our NPS using the standard method of subtracting the percentage of members who respond that they are not likely to recommend our providers from the percentage of members that respond that they are likely to recommend our providers, with responses based on a scale of 0 to 10. The resulting NPS is an index that ranges from a low of -100 to a high of 100.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our technology platform advances consumer engagement and health through proactive digital health screenings, post-visit digital follow-ups, real-time access to medical records, and around-the-clock availability of our friendly and knowledgeable providers. 
 Our members receive access to 24/7 on-demand digital health services with quick response times. Members also have access to scheduled virtual visits as well as inviting in-office care in convenient locations with warm and caring staff. In addition to supporting members with routine and preventative primary, chronic and acute care, we provide lab- and immunization services, COVID-19 testing and care, behavioral health, women’s health, men’s health, LGBTQ+ care, pediatrics, sports medicine, lifestyle and wellbeing programs.
  
• | Employers. We support employers across a diverse set of industries in achieving key goals of their health benefits offerings such as attracting and engaging employees, improving employee productivity and wellbeing, and delivering higher levels of value-based care. We are also helping them increase the safety of their workplace through screening for, treating, and immunizing against communicable diseases such as COVID-19. With real-time video and phone consults available typically within minutes, and same and next day in-office appointments, we have demonstrated a 41% reduction in emergency room visits and total employer cost savings of 8% or more based on a 2018 report. Additionally, a peer-reviewed study published in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) Network Open in 2020 linked our membership-based, primary care model combining virtual, near-site and work-site services with 45% lower total medical and prescription claims costs for one employer, including 54% lower spending on specialty care, 43% lower spending on surgery, 33% lower spending on emergency department care, and 26% lower spending on prescriptions. Since then, we have further evolved our service offering, including scheduled virtual visits or behavioral health visits, which we believe provides additional value to employers and their employees. We have also launched a 24/7 virtual only service offering which is available exclusively to employers in geographies where we do not yet have a physical presence. This service offering allows employers to provide One Medical to all of their employees regardless of their location, while providing us with better insights about employer demographics and potential future demand for our other offerings. Employers typically cover our membership fee for their employees, with over 75% of employers also covering their employees’ dependents’ memberships as of December 31, 2020. Employers can add our services at any point during the year, as our services typically fit within their existing health benefits offerings and are typically covered under an employer’s routine health insurance benefit program, allowing for seamless and quick implementation. Within enterprise clients, our median estimated activation rate as of December 31, 2020, was over 40%, which we believe we can increase over time. We define estimated activation rate for any enterprise client at a given time as the percentage of eligible lives enrolled as members. Some of our enterprise clients offer membership benefits to the dependents of their employees, for which we assume eligible lives include one dependent per employee.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providers. Our culture, technology, team-based approach, and salaried provider model help address the fundamental issues driving physician burnout. Our culture allows us to attract and retain top board-certified physicians and premier team members. We are focused on continuing to increase our diversity amongst providers so that our provider base reflects the diversity of the communities and members we serve. Our proprietary technology platform allows for meaningful reductions in desktop medicine burdens, which are the excessive administrative hassles associated with the use of EHRs. Our support

team takes on many of the administrative burdens for scheduling and insurance coordination. Our in-office and virtual medical teams jointly deliver longitudinal health care. Our salary-based provider compensation model incentivizes delivery of the right care at the right time, without the adverse financial incentives that fee-for-service or capitated compensation systems can have on clinical decision-making.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Health Networks. Health networks partner with us for consumer-driven care, direct-to-employer relationships and coordinated networks of attributable lives. Through our partnerships, we connect our primarily working-age, commercially insured membership base with health networks without the costs and risks these health networks typically face in the development of their own primary care networks. We clinically and digitally integrate with our health network partners to advance more seamless member access to partner specialists and facilities when needed, while supporting reductions in duplicative testing and excessive delays often seen across uncoordinated healthcare settings. Such coordinated care can deliver better service levels and outcomes for consumers, while advancing employee productivity and value-based care to employers.

 We believe our model is highly scalable. We are physically present in 13 markets today, including Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Orange County, Phoenix, Portland, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., and primarily serve a working-age, commercially-insured population and associated dependents. As of December 31, 2020, we had 107 physical offices, including some employer on-site clinics. Additionally, our members can access our 24/7 digital health services nationwide. As of December 31, 2020, we had greater than 8,000 enterprise clients of various sizes across industries. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we retained 9 out of 10 of our consumer members and more than 90% of our enterprise contract value. We grew our membership by 339% from December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2020.
 We derive net revenue from multiple stakeholders, including (i) consumers, (ii) enterprise clients such as employers, schools, and universities, and (iii) health networks. We recognize net revenue as (i) membership revenue from enterprise clients and consumer subscription fees, which are typically annual in nature, (ii) partnership revenue predominantly on a per member per month (“PMPM”) basis from health networks, largely fixed payments from enterprise clients for on-site medical services, COVID-19 on-site services, and capitation payments from Independent Physician Associations (“IPAs”), and (iii) net patient service revenue on a per visit basis from health insurers and patients. We are in-network with most health insurance plans in all of our markets.
 Chief Technology Officer Transition
 On March 16, 2021, Kimber Lockhart informed us of her intent to step back from her role as Chief Technology Officer of 1Life upon return from her personal leave of absence and to transition to become a part-time employee of 1Life. The effective date for Ms. Lockhart’s resignation as Chief Technology Officer has not been determined and Ms. Lockhart intends to continue to serve as Chief Technology Officer until her successor is identified and has moved into the role. We have commenced a search for a replacement Chief Technology Officer.
Industry Challenges and Our Opportunity
 The current state of the healthcare ecosystem leaves key stakeholders frustrated and with unmet needs, delivering suboptimal results for consumers, employers, providers and health networks. We believe that these unmet needs represent a significant opportunity for us.
Consumers
 According to a 2016 report, approximately 81% of consumers are dissatisfied with their healthcare experience. Their frustrations include long lead times to schedule physician appointments and long waits once checked-in at provider offices. Appointments often occur in crowded medical offices and are typically short in duration, affording limited time to develop deeper provider-patient relationships. Opportunities to engage with providers before and after visits, as well as during nights and weekends, are often limited or non-existent, even though healthcare needs are not constrained to the operating hours of provider offices. Care delivered is also often uncoordinated with providers, leaving consumers to navigate their own way through a complex system.
 3

Employers
 To attract and retain staff, employers are making significant investments in health benefits; yet, as commercial insurance costs have reached record highs, employers and employees remain frustrated. Barriers to accessing timely care during the day and after business hours cause employees to miss work and lose productivity. As a result, many employees self-direct themselves to higher cost settings such as emergency rooms. Additionally, uncoordinated care across primary care, specialty care and behavioral health settings creates frustration and causes excessive spending. According to the National Academy of Medicine, approximately 30% of all U.S. healthcare spending is estimated to be avoidable wasted spending.
Providers
 By predominantly compensating primary care providers on volume, the prevalent fee-for-service approach seen within the industry incentivizes short and transactional medical encounters, often with insufficient time to address underlying issues related to acute care, chronic disease, and behavioral health issues. Such fee-for-service compensation may also incentivize greater referrals to specialists for more time-intensive cases, even when such patients could otherwise be treated effectively within primary care. Management of preventive care and chronic conditions through longitudinal relationships is typically less-reimbursed, if paid for at all. In addition, providers often find themselves performing excessive administrative tasks that could be better performed by other staff or eliminated altogether. They suffer from rising administrative time spent populating data into cumbersome EHR systems, and documentation hassles associated with insurance procedures. These dynamics contribute to lower job satisfaction and provider burnout.
Health Networks
 While many health networks have sought to better integrate primary care with specialty and hospital care, they may underperform on service, access, and coordination of care. This is partly due to their internal incentive systems, processes, and technologies, which are typically focused on addressing high revenue specialty care, rather than best supporting primary care. Moreover, primary care networks can be very costly to develop, and can require significant ongoing investments to operate, while often underperforming on strategic and financial objectives. According to the American Hospital Association’s Futurescan survey of hospital CEOs and leaders published in 2019, 75% of hospital and health systems operate their primary care networks at a loss or are willing to do so, with 76% of health system leaders indicating they are pursuing or are likely to pursue external relationships to advance their physician networks and better serve consumers.
 We have developed a human-centered, technology-powered primary care model that simultaneously addresses the aforementioned frustrations and unmet needs of key stakeholders. As we continue to deploy our model at scale, we disrupt the healthcare ecosystem from within its current structure through our:

Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe the following are our key competitive strengths.
 Modernized Membership-Based Model
 Our membership-based model supports ongoing and longitudinal relationships where we can serve as trusted advisors to our members and as partners to our enterprise clients. Our model also generates stable revenue which is recurring in nature. By having an enrolled population of members, we can proactively reach out to members to encourage adherence to treatment protocols or to check in on their care needs. The relationship inherent in a membership model is very different than the traditional model of transactional patient care visits, where a provider typically only engages with a patient if the patient comes in for a visit. We proactively engage with our members on a regular basis through our digital platform and in our welcoming offices, and believe we are better able to develop long-term connections and relationships with them.
Extraordinary Customer Experience
 Our human-centered approach is focused on providing a superior experience to our members, as evidenced by the bundling of services within our membership model, the way we hire and train our team, the culture of caring we foster, our easy-to-use technology, our 24/7 digital health, our inviting in-office care, our compassionate and salaried providers and our streamlined Lean processes. Whether members call, click or visit, they experience outstanding service, as evidenced by our average NPS of 90 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. See “Overview” section above for a description of how we calculate NPS. Our virtual care is available around-the-clock. Our inviting medical offices are well-appointed and modern, and our providers and staff are very friendly and trained in customer service. We are committed to not keeping members waiting long, if at all, and our longer appointments provide our team with more time to address member needs. Our technology is designed to promote frictionless access, ease of use and high engagement. We look to address the whole-person needs of our members, providing physical and mental health services, lab services, and coordinating specialty services with health network partners. Our administrative staff is available to answer benefits questions and help navigate the healthcare ecosystem on behalf of our members.
Simultaneously Addressing the Needs of Consumers, Employers, Providers and Health Networks
 Our modernized model simultaneously addresses the frustrations and unmet needs of key stakeholders, transforming health care from within the current ecosystem. For consumers, we deliver an extraordinary experience and superior results, including on key primary care-related HEDIS quality measures. For employers, we help improve employee productivity through frictionless access to virtual and in-office care and reduce medical costs by avoiding unnecessary emergency room and specialty visits. For providers, we create a more engaging and manageable primary care work environment by leveraging a salaried model and our proprietary technology. With health networks, we clinically integrate to expand their connections to commercially insured enrollees, and we are in-network with most health insurance plans in all of our markets. Accordingly, we believe our model delivers differentiated value to all key stakeholders simultaneously within the current healthcare ecosystem.
Engaged, Salaried Providers Delivering Best-in-Class Care
 We offer an outstanding environment to practice primary care, as reflected in our high provider retention rates and engagement scores. Our salaried compensation approach allows our providers to deliver patient-centered care without impacting their pay as might be the case under fee-for-service compensation approaches. Our providers also have significantly fewer EHR tasks to complete due to our proprietary technology that is purpose-built for primary care, freeing up their time to focus on delivering outstanding clinical care.

Proprietary Technology Platform
 Our ability to simultaneously deliver significant value to key stakeholders is deeply rooted in our purpose-built, modernized technology platform. Our proprietary technology platform powers all aspects of our company: engaging members, supporting providers and advancing business objectives. Our technology allows us to proactively engage members with personalized clinical outreach and improve health through online scheduling, virtual provider visits and ready access to health information. Our technology also supports providers by leveraging machine learning to reduce and re-route tasks that needlessly create administrative burdens while supporting team-based care. This allows providers to spend more time delivering clinical care, while facilitating higher levels of member responsiveness. Our technology also advances operational efficiencies, as our product designers and engineers collaborate closely with clinical and operational team members to observe and optimize workflows. Our platform is built on a modern cloud-based technology stack, employing Agile development cycles and a DevOps approach to infrastructure. Our modular, service-oriented architecture utilizes Application Programming Interface (“API”) standards for ease of implementing new functionalities and integrating with external systems. 
Operating Platform for High Performance at Scale
 Our approach for operating and scaling our platform is based on leading process improvement and management practices. We leverage Lean methodologies for process improvement, human-centered design thinking, behavioral design, and Agile methodologies for software development to deliver high performance levels at scale. Our operational processes, software development and staffing models, including our virtual medical team, are designed to work together to create efficiencies and uniquely achieve our objectives. Moreover, we standardize our processes and practices so we can efficiently deliver consistent outcomes at scale across existing and new markets, which we believe will further drive our financial performance.
Highly Experienced Management Team
 Our management team has extensive experience working with leading health systems, health plans, technology companies, service organizations, consumer brands, and enterprise-sales-driven companies. Our leadership embodies our cultural alignment around our behavioral tenants of being human-centered, team-based, unbounded in thinking, driven to excel, and intellectually curious. Our leaders help organize teams of clinicians, technologists and staff to regularly engage together in designing processes and software to further advance our objectives. Accordingly, our team is well positioned to execute on our objectives and advance an outstanding workplace environment.
Our Growth Strategies
 To transform health care at scale, we can pursue growth through the following avenues.
 Grow consumer and enterprise membership in existing markets
 We have significant opportunities to increase membership in our existing markets through (i) sales to new consumers and enterprise clients, (ii) expansion of the number of enrolled members, including dependents, within our enterprise clients and (iii) adding other potential services. As of December 31, 2020, we had more than 8,000 enterprise clients. Of our 549,000 members as of December 31, 2020, 58% were from our enterprise clients. Within enterprise clients, our median activation rate as of December 31, 2020 was over 40%, We believe the number of clients and the number of enrolled members will increase over time as our brand awareness grows and our customer relationships mature. We define estimated activation rate for any enterprise client at a given time as the percentage of eligible lives enrolled as members. Some of our enterprise clients offer membership benefits to the dependents of their employees, for which we assume eligible lives include one dependent per employee. Additionally, while the percentage of enterprise clients offering our services to dependents of their employees has grown from 67% in 2016 to over 75% as of December 31, 2020, we believe we have significant room for further growth with dependents. Furthermore, as we continue to scale our presence, we anticipate an increasing number of larger national and regional employers will look to partner with us for our services.

Expand into new markets
 We are physically present in 13 markets with plans to enter four new markets in 2021. We assess potential markets using a variety of metrics, including population demographics and density, employer presence, potential health network partners, and other factors. In addition, we have launched One Medical Now, a new service offering that provides 24/7 access to unlimited virtual care nationwide, which is sold to new and existing enterprise clients to cover employees in geographies where we are not yet physically present. We do not count employees who have access to or use One Medical Now as members, but we believe this new virtual offering may help us enroll new members in a new geography if and when we decide to offer our complete product offering, which includes a physical footprint. We believe our complete offering is viable in most geographies across the United States. 
 Grow health network partnerships
 To accelerate our growth and presence, we can extend existing health network partnerships into new markets where our partners may also have a presence, or we can enter into new health network partnerships in new markets. In 2020, we entered into four new markets, two of which were through expansion with existing health network partnerships and two were with new health network partnerships. We typically partner with one health network in a given market, and as that partner grows its market presence, we can grow even further with them.
 Expand services and populations
 Our core offering today is centered on the commercially insured segment. In addition to supporting members with routine and preventative primary, chronic and acute care, we typically provide lab and immunization services, women’s health, men’s health, LGBTQ+ care, pediatrics, sports medicine, lifestyle and wellbeing programs. In addition, throughout 2020, we launched 
  
• | COVID-19 testing, and counseling across all of our markets, including in our offices and in several mobile COVID-19 testing sites;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | COVID-19 vaccinations in select geographies;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Healthy Together, our COVID-19 screening and testing program for employers, schools and universities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mindset by One Medical, our behavioral health service integrated within primary care; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | One Medical Now, an expansion of our 24/7 on-demand digital health solutions to employees of enterprise clients located in geographies where we are not yet physically present.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Remote Visits, where our providers perform typical primary care visits with our members remotely from either one of our offices or from a provider’s home.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to continued expansion of the services we offer to the commercially insured segment, we believe our model is also well positioned for other populations such as Medicare, and other reimbursement mechanisms such as shared savings reimbursement models, capitation, and other accountable care approaches, where we can capitalize on our population health capabilities. Our technology has also been developed with modern APIs to enable direct integration with channel partners and other third-party offerings, increasing the potential breadth of our modernized platform solution.
 Competition
 We compete in a highly fragmented primary care market with direct and indirect competitors that offer varying services to key stakeholders such as consumers, employers, providers, and health networks. Our competitive success is contingent on our ability to simultaneously address the needs of key stakeholders efficiently and with superior outcomes at scale. We expect to face increasing competition, both from current competitors, who may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages to compete for some or all key stakeholders in our markets, as well as new entrants into our market.
 We believe our most direct competition today is from primary care providers who are employed by or affiliated with health networks. Due to our growing number of partnerships with these health networks, we increasingly view 
 9

primary care providers affiliated with such health networks as potential partners as opposed to direct competitors. We also face competition from direct-to-consumer solutions or employer-focused on-site primary care offerings. These competitors may be narrower in their competitive footprint and may not address all the key stakeholders we serve simultaneously. Our indirect competitors also include episodic point solutions such as telemedicine offerings as well as urgent care providers. These offerings may typically pay providers on a fee-for-service basis rather than the salaried model we employ. Given the size of the healthcare industry and the extent of unmet needs, we expect additional competition, potentially from new companies, including smaller emerging companies which could introduce new solutions and services, as well as other incumbent players in the healthcare industry or from other industries who could develop their own offerings and may have substantial resources and relationships to leverage. In particular, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, existing or new competitors have developed or further invested in telemedicine and remote medicine programs and ventures, which would compete with our virtual care offerings. With the emergence of new technologies and market entrants, we expect to face increasing competition over time, which we believe will generally increase awareness of the need for modernized primary care models and other innovative solutions in the United States and globally.
 The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
  
• | patient engagement, satisfaction and utilization;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | convenience, accessibility and availability;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | brand awareness and reputation;
--+--------------------------------


• | technology capabilities including interoperability with legacy enterprise and health network infrastructures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to address the needs of employers and payers;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to attract and retain quality providers;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | ability to reduce costs;
--+-------------------------


• | level of participation in insurance plans;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | alignment with health networks;
--+--------------------------------


• | domain expertise in health care, technology, sales and service;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | scalability of models; and
--+---------------------------


• | operational execution abilities.
--+---------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors and we believe the offerings of competitors inadequately address the needs of key stakeholders simultaneously or fail to do so at scale.
 Sales and Marketing
 Our marketing and sales initiatives focus on member growth through two primary avenues: directly acquiring consumer members, and signing agreements with employers that sponsor employee memberships as part of their benefits packages. We use marketing and sales strategies to reach consumers as well as enterprise benefits leaders. Enterprise marketing and sales strategies also include account-based marketing, business development initiatives, and client service teams focused on customer acquisition, employee enrollment, and member engagement. With a growing national model, we aspire to be the most loved brand in health care. We anchor our brand messaging on how we delight our members with care for real life. 
Consumer Sales & Marketing
 When we market and sell directly to individuals, we initially focus on increasing brand awareness, followed by performance marketing targeted toward member enrollment.
 Our marketing strategy in new markets is primarily centered on increasing overall brand awareness, familiarity, consideration and ultimately enrollment. To achieve these objectives, we showcase our model via direct mail, print, digital, out-of-home, broadcast, and social media advertising. We also develop thought leadership content such as 
 10

whitepapers, eBooks, and blog posts and use public relations to secure earned media placements. Additionally, we participate in industry conferences, and may partner with media outlets, event venues, and local businesses to increase brand awareness.
 As brand awareness increases in more established markets, we shift our efforts to performance marketing focused on both customer acquisition and engagement. Our performance marketing initiatives include customized task-based in-app messages and email communications to drive engagement among members, in addition to more targeted advertisements through direct mail, Google Search, YouTube and social media for member acquisition.
 Enterprise Sales & Marketing
 Our in-house enterprise sales force is organized by geography and customer size. To support our sales force, we segment market data to help with prospect qualification and leverage publicly available and trade organization material to focus on enterprise clients who we believe value health outcomes and medical cost reduction targets. The sales analytics team further supports our value to employers with population health data and medical cost assessment. Additionally, our client services team actively manages our customer accounts through in-depth reporting on a variety of metrics such as NPS, member activation, utilization, engagement, and value. 
 We also work with channel partners such as payroll and professional employer organizations to reach enterprise clients, including small and midsize businesses and early stage new businesses. Additionally, we partner with select regional and national benefits brokers and consultants to educate potential customers on our offerings.
 After onboarding new enterprise accounts, we shift our focus to enrolling and engaging employees. These efforts include on-site visits to employers, enterprise email communications, and social media and other forms of performance marketing. In 2020, these efforts also increasingly included COVID-19 screening and testing, and flu vaccination campaigns. 
 Intellectual Property
 We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. As of December 31, 2020, we exclusively own five registered trademarks in the United States, including One Medical, with five more registrations currently pending. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use or may use in our business. As of December 31, 2020, we had no issued patents and no pending patent applications anywhere in the world, and therefore, we do not have patent protection for any of our proprietary technology, including our technology platform, mobile app or web portal.
 We seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information, including our algorithms, source and object code, designs, and business processes, through security measures and contractual restrictions. We seek to limit access to our confidential and proprietary information to a “need to know” basis and enter into confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, customers and vendors that may receive or otherwise have access to any confidential or proprietary information. We also obtain written invention assignment agreements from our employees, consultants, and vendors that assign to us all right, interest, and title to inventions and work product developed during their employment or service engagement with us. In the normal course of business, we provide our intellectual property to external parties through licensing or restricted use agreements. We have established a system of security measures to help protect our computer systems from security breaches and computer viruses. We have employed various technology and process-based methods, such as clustered and multi-layer firewalls, intrusion detection systems, vulnerability assessments, threat intelligence, content filtering, endpoint security (including anti-malware and detection response capabilities), email security mechanisms, and access control mechanisms. We also use encryption techniques for data at rest and in transit. 
 Government Regulation
 The healthcare industry and the practice of medicine are governed by an extensive and complex framework of federal and state laws, which continue to evolve and change over time. The costs and resources necessary to comply with these laws are high. Our profitability depends in part upon our ability, and that of the One Medical PCs and their 
 11

providers, to operate in compliance with applicable laws and to maintain all applicable licenses. A review of our operations by courts or regulatory authorities could result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations, or the healthcare regulatory environment could change in a way that restricts our operations.
 Practice of Medicine
 Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting
 We contract with the One Medical PCs, who in turn employ or retain physicians and other medical providers to deliver professional clinical services to patients. We enter into ASAs with the One Medical PCs pursuant to which it provides them with a wide range of administrative services and receive payment from the One Medical PC. These administrative services arrangements are subject to state laws, including those in certain of the states where we operate, which prohibit the practice of medicine by, and/or the splitting of professional fees with, non-professional persons or entities such as general business corporations.
 Corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting prohibitions vary widely from state to state. In addition, such prohibitions are subject to broad powers of interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Our failure to comply could lead to adverse action against us and/or our providers by courts or state agencies, civil or criminal penalties, loss of provider licenses, or the need to restructure our business model and/or physician relationships, any of which could harm our business.
 Practice of Medicine and Provider Licensing
 The practice of medicine is subject to various federal, state, and local laws and requirements, including, among other things, laws relating to the practice of medicine (including remote care), quality and adequacy of care, non-physician personnel, supervisory requirements, behavioral health, medical equipment, and the prescribing and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances.
Telehealth Provider Licensing, Medical Practice, Certification and Related Laws and Guidelines
 Providers who provide professional medical services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine in the state in which the patient is located, unless there are applicable exceptions. Federal and state laws also limit the ability of providers to prescribe pharmaceuticals and controlled substances via telehealth. We have established systems for ensuring that our affiliated providers are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our members occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to adverse action against our providers, which could harm our business model and/or physician relationships and have a negative impact on our business.
Other Healthcare Laws
 HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and their implementing regulations, includes several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to non-governmental payers. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, which includes private payers. Violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from government healthcare programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme, or device, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund an overpayment.
 In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, (1) inappropriate billing of services to government healthcare programs, (2) employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in government healthcare programs, and (3) offering or providing Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries with any remuneration, including full or partial waivers of co-payments and deductibles, that are likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier 
 12

(subject to an exception for non-routine, unadvertised co-payment and deductible waivers based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts).
 State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
 We must comply with various federal and state laws related to the privacy and security of personally identifiable information, or PII, including health information. In particular, HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information, or PHI, and requires the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI. The One Medical PCs are regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. HIPAA’s requirements are also directly applicable to the contractors, agents, and other business associates of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI in connection with their provision of services to covered entities. We are a business associate of the One Medical PCs, health network partners and other covered entities when performing certain administrative services on their behalf.
 We are also subject to the HIPAA breach notification rule, which requires covered entities to notify affected individuals of breaches of unsecured PHI. In addition, covered entities must notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of Civil Rights, or OCR, and the local media if a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to OCR on an annual basis. The HIPAA regulations also require business associates to notify the covered entity of breaches by the business associate.
 Violations of HIPAA can result in civil and criminal penalties, including civil financial penalties ranging from $119 to $59,522 per violation (as of 2020, and subject to periodic adjustments for inflation).
 Many states in which we operate have their own laws protecting the privacy and security of personal information, including health information. We must comply with such laws in the states where we do business in addition to our obligations under HIPAA. In some states, such as California, state privacy laws are even more protective than HIPAA. It may sometimes be necessary to modify our operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. State data privacy and security laws are subject to change, and we could be subject to financial penalties and sanctions if we fail to comply with these laws.
 In addition to federal and state laws protecting the privacy and security of personal information, we may be subject to other types of federal and state privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security, along with laws that impose specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 Federal Stark Law
 We are subject to the federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain “designated health services” if the referring physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of various fraud, waste, and abuse laws, including the Stark Law, can be considered a predicate legal violation to submission of a false claim under the federal False Claims Act (described below) on the grounds that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws and rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. Penalties for violating the Stark Law may include: denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the law, recoupments of monies paid for such services, civil penalties for each violation and three times the dollar value of each such service, and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Violations of the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 13

Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which, subject to certain exceptions known as “safe harbors,” prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any bribe, kickback, rebate or other remuneration, in cash or in kind, in return for, or to induce, the (1) the referral of a person covered by government healthcare programs, (2) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under government healthcare programs, or (3) the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging or recommending the purchasing, leasing, or ordering, of any item or service reimbursable under government healthcare programs. Federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if just one purpose of a payment is to induce referrals. Actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it is not required, which makes it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the state of mind required for a violation. In addition to a few statutory exceptions, the Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, has promulgated safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute, but business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all elements of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by OIG and other enforcement authorities. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from government healthcare programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, including fines of $50,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
False Claims Act
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims to government programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Some states have adopted similar fraud and false claims laws. Government agencies engage in significant civil and criminal enforcement efforts against healthcare companies under the False Claims Act and other civil and criminal statutes. False Claims Act investigations can be initiated not only by the government, but by private parties through qui tam (or whistleblower) lawsuits. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines ranging from $11,665 to $23,331 per false claim or statement (as of 2020, and subject to annual adjustments for inflation), plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. Violations of the False Claims Act violations can also result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.
State Fraud, Waste and Abuse Laws
 Several states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud, waste, and abuse laws to those described above. The scope and content of these laws vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities. Some states’ fraud and abuse laws, known as “all-payer laws,” are not limited to government healthcare programs, but apply more broadly to items or services reimbursed by any payer, including commercial insurers. Liability under state fraud, waste, and abuse laws could result in fines, penalties, and restrictions on our ability to operate in those jurisdictions.
Our Health Network Partnerships
 We have entered into strategic partnership arrangements with each of our health network partners under which we and the health network partner create a clinically integrated care delivery model that coordinates our network of affiliated primary care practices with the health network partner’s healthcare system to better deliver coordinated care for members, improve operational efficiencies, and deliver value to employers and other players.
Fee Structure
 Under most of the strategic partnership arrangements, the health network partners contract with one or more of the One Medical PCs for professional clinical services and contract with 1Life for management, operational and administrative services, including billing and collection services and designing and managing the day-to-day administration of the business aspects of the primary care practices. Under these arrangements, when our medical offices provide professional clinical services to covered members, we, as administrator, perform billing and collection 
 14

services on behalf of the health network, and the health network receives the fees for the services provided, including those paid by members’ insurance plans. In return for these professional clinical, management, operational and administrative services, we receive fees from these health network partners on a PMPM basis, which may be based on various factors such as visit rates, other primary care relationships our health network partners may have, and the rates these health network partners receive from payers. In lieu of PMPM fees, certain of our clinically integrated health network partners extend their health insurance contracts to us. Under these arrangements, we bill for and receive fees directly for professional clinical services provided to members.
 Term and Termination
 The term of each strategic partnership arrangement is typically five or more years and automatically renews for additional two- to five-year terms unless either we or the health network partners decide not to renew. We or the health network partners generally may terminate a strategic partnership arrangement with 90 days’ notice upon certain events such as uncured breach, mutual consent, or a change in law that conflicts with the applicable arrangement. The strategic partnership arrangements generally may be terminated immediately upon certain events such as bankruptcy, exclusion and in some cases, business combinations involving us and a specified competing health network. Certain health network partners may also terminate upon their determination that we no longer meet their criteria for clinical partnership or the values or mission of the health network partner.
 Exclusivity and Non-Solicitation
 Under the terms of strategic partnership arrangements, we typically cannot enter into a similar arrangement with           direct competitors to the health network partner within the territory covered by the strategic partnership arrangement. Additionally, the terms of some of the strategic partnership arrangements include a mutual non-solicitation clause, prohibiting us and our health network partners from soliciting each other’s employees during the term of the arrangement and for one year following its expiration, subject to certain customary recruiting practices.
 Clinic Commitments and Development Fees
 Pursuant to each strategic partnership arrangement, we typically commit to open an initial number of clinics, ranging from low single digits to mid-teen double digits depending on the area covered, within the initial term. Our health network partners pay us certain development fees for the opening of each clinic.
Our Enterprise Client Agreements
 We enter into contractual arrangements with our enterprise clients pursuant to which our clients purchase memberships from us for their employees and, in certain circumstances, we provide on-site and nearsite clinics and health services. The transaction price for memberships under most of these contracts is determined on a per employee per month basis, based on the number of employees eligible for membership established at the beginning of each contract period. Our contracts with enterprise clients typically have one- to three-year terms.
Google Services Agreement
 In August 2017, we entered into an inbound services agreement, or the ISA, with Google Inc. and certain of the One Medical PCs. For 2019 and 2020, Google accounted for 10% of our net revenue. Under the ISA, we and Google enter into statements of work, or SOWs. As part of one or more of the SOW’s, Google sponsors memberships for their employees and dependents in certain markets in exchange for payment of annual fees. We also provide on-site clinics and health services for certain Google office locations under one or more SOWs. Under the ISA, Google is not obligated to enter into any SOWs with us, and we are not obligated to provide any services to Google except as agreed in the SOWs. Any party may terminate the ISA or any SOW following an uncured material breach, or suspend or terminate any SOW if applicable law prohibits performance under the SOW.

Human Capital Resources
 Employee Well-Being and Culture
 
We recognize that to be successful in our mission to transform healthcare, we need to take care of our teams as much as we take care of the members we serve. We reinforce this through our culture and team-based approach to longitudinal care as well as our salaried provider model, which eliminates the volume-based, fee-for-service compensation model commonly seen in our industry that could drive provider burnout. We also offer flexible work arrangements and opportunities to practice in office or virtually. We believe this results in a better quality of life and work-life balance. Our commitment to a team-based, collaborative environment and the values and benefits we provide to employees contributed to our recognition as a Great Place to Work in 2019. We were also named by Forbes and Statista as one of America’s Best Midsize Employers of 2021. 
 
We believe our culture embodies five distinct qualities which we refer to as our DNA:
 
Human-Centered. We stay humble and empathetic, putting people at the heart of everything we build and every decision we make.
 
Team-Based. We communicate effectively, respect our teammates, and make the difficult tradeoffs that foster the success of the organization.
 
Intellectually Curious. We know we don't know everything; we're always eager to learn, and we're never afraid to question the status quo.
 
Unbounded-Thinking. By staying open minded, creative, and positive, we aim to push beyond constraints that have stymied those before us.
 
Driven to Excel. In our quest to be the best Primary Care group in the country, we focus on getting things done and pay attention to the little details that matter.
Training and Development
 
We believe in ensuring that all team members have access to tools to help them grow their careers and have focused our training and development on two primary areas: professional/career and leader development. We have invested in an array of internally generated and externally sourced learning resources, including a range of in-person, virtual and self-directed learning opportunities for our team members to help them develop the skills and competencies to further their career at One Medical. 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
We also recognize the importance of having a diverse and inclusive environment as part of our mission of transforming healthcare. We maintain a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice Committee to encourage best practices to foster diversity, equity, inclusion and social justice in the workplace. To help support career development for our Black and Latinx team members, we have implemented a mentorship programs and have also implemented training programs to help advance our culture of diversity, inclusion, equity and justice. Recently, we have also established a Health Equity Domain Working Group that evaluates policies and best practices on providing care in a manner that respects the diversity of our patients and the cultural factors that can affect their health.
 As of December 31, 2020, across 1Life and the One Medical PCs, we had 1,957 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and we have not experienced any work stoppages due to labor disagreements.
