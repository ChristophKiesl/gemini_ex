GENERAL
Background
Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. (referred to, with its consolidated subsidiaries, as "we", "us", "our", the "Company", "SWM INTL" or "SWM" unless the context indicates otherwise) is a multinational producer of specialty papers and resin-based products headquartered in the United States of America. 
The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1995 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark Corporation ("Kimberly-Clark"). On November 30, 1995, Kimberly-Clark transferred its tobacco-related paper and other specialty paper products businesses conducted in the United States, France and Canada to the Company and distributed all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company to its stockholders (the "spin-off"). As a result, the Company became an independent public company.
We conduct business in over 90 countries and operate 18 production locations worldwide, with facilities in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Luxembourg, Russia, Brazil, China and Poland. We also have a 50% equity interest in two joint ventures in China: China Tobacco Mauduit (Jiangmen) Paper Industry Ltd. ("CTM"), which produces cigarette papers, and China Tobacco Schweitzer (Yunnan) Reconstituted Tobacco Co. Ltd. ("CTS"), which produces reconstituted tobacco leaf products. Since October 2015, the Company has operated under two reportable segments: Engineered Papers ("EP"), which produces cigarette papers, reconstituted tobacco leaf, and wrapper and binder products for sale to cigarette and cigar manufacturers, as well as other non-tobacco specialized commercial and industrial paper products, and Advanced Materials & Structures ("AMS"), which manufactures resin-based products used in specialty applications in the filtration, infrastructure and construction, transportation, industrial, and medical end-markets. 
Our principal executive office is located at 100 North Point Center East, Suite 600, Alpharetta, Georgia 30022-8246 and our telephone number is (800) 514-0186. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "SWM".
Strategic Transformation - Philosophy and Approach
Through 2013, the Company largely operated as a tobacco-centric paper operation, almost exclusively serving the demands of cigarette and cigar manufacturers. In 2012, SWM's management and Board of Directors elected to pursue a strategic transformation and diversify the business by increasing sales and profit streams outside the tobacco industry, primarily through acquisitions, while carefully managing the profitable but mature tobacco operations and maximizing the Company's cash flow. Management believes that, over time, this strategy will prove effective in counterbalancing the expected long-term secular declines of the tobacco industry and transform SWM into a more growth-oriented enterprise. The Company began selectively targeting acquisition candidates that served diversified end-markets, had high-value technologies for specialty applications and commensurate margins, defensible competitive positions, and strong growth prospects. In addition, management believes many acquisition targets can have unique synergy 
 1

opportunities when combined with the assets and capabilities of SWM, such as a global infrastructure, specialized paper-making technologies, and a robust program for operational excellence and cost management. 
With respect to continued organic growth, the Company continues to expend resources to further diversify and expand our product portfolio through the utilization of our LeafLab vegetable reconstitution incubator at our facility in France. Our reconstitution technologies are planned to be utilized in products serving the cosmetics and packaging industries. As the Company continues to focus on development opportunities for newer products that leverage our specialized paper-making and reconstitution technologies, future plans also include an investment to modify existing paper machinery in order to produce a specialty filtration paper. Furthermore, SWM’s reconstituted tobacco plays a prominent role in certain Heat not Burn reduced-risk tobacco products, a rapidly emerging technology with an initial sales ramp expected in 2017.

As a result of the Company's strategic actions to date, non-tobacco sales as a percentage of total Company net sales have grown from approximately 6% in 2013 to approximately 40% in 2016. Through our diversification process over the past several years, the tobacco industry has remained challenging; however the Company's cash flow has remained solid. In 2016, SWM generated approximately $99 million in free cash flow, calculated by deducting capital expenditures of approximately $28 million and capitalized software costs of approximately $3 million from operating cash provided by continuing operations of approximately $130 million. Management has used free cash flow, along with liquidity available through our credit facility, to support merger and acquisition activity and internal growth-oriented investments. The EP segment, which still primarily services the tobacco industry, has historically been the Company's principal source of cash flow, enabling growth-oriented investments in the AMS segment and consistently providing dividends to shareholders. 
Strategic Transformation - Execution
In early 2013, the Company announced a capital allocation strategy to return at least one-third of its free cash flow to investors through dividends and share buybacks, while also deploying free cash flow and balance sheet capacity to fund the diversification investments needed to improve SWM's long-term growth outlook. Pursuant to this capital allocation strategy, from 2013 to 2016, the Company has paid more than $180 million in dividends and spent $50 million on a share buyback, which resulted in returning approximately 46% of free cash flow to investors in the aggregate during the four-year period. The Company has also invested a total of approximately $540 million over the same period, and an additional $295 million in early 2017, in diversification through acquisitions.
In December 2013, SWM acquired DelStar, Inc. ("DelStar"), a manufacturer of resin-based plastic nets, films and non-wovens, focused on specialty applications in the filtration, medical, and industrial end-markets. DelStar established SWM's presence in new industries and added a portfolio of high-value technologies and manufacturing capabilities. Management considered DelStar an attractive independent asset which stood to benefit from SWM's global operations, capabilities in Lean Six Sigma/Operational Excellence disciplines, and its ability to fund bolt-on acquisitions and make other strategic capital investments. In December 2014, the Company executed two bolt-on transactions, acquiring assets from Pronamic Industries, Inc. ("Pronamic") and Smith & Nephew ("SNN"). The Pronamic assets added new technologies to DelStar's filtration business, enhancing our presence in air filtration, while the SNN transaction approximately doubled the DelStar medical business with expanded wound care product offerings. 
In October 2015, the Company acquired Argotec Intermediate Holdings LLC ("Argotec"), a manufacturer of urethane films for specialty applications for the transportation end-market. Argotec derives a significant portion of its sales from growing specialty surface protection applications such as automotive paint protection and glass lamination in the transportation end-market. This business also serves customers in the medical end-market, furthering our existing presence, as well as the industrial end-market. From a technology standpoint, Argotec added to SWM's growing resin extrusion capabilities and added scale to the AMS growth platform. 
On January 20, 2017, SWM acquired Conwed Plastics LLC (“Conwed”), a leading producer of resin-based netting solutions. Conwed will be integrated within our AMS segment. Further details can be found in this filing under "Description of Business - Recent Acquisition" and Note 23. Subsequent Events, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial

Statements, as well as the acquisition announcement included as an exhibit in our current report on Form 8-K filed on December 14, 2016.
The acquisitions described above comprise our AMS segment. The Company believes that these businesses offer long-term growth opportunities across a broad set of end-markets, advancing SWM's goal of diversifying its revenue stream, while maintaining consistency with many attributes of SWM. These core attributes include a focus on highly engineered materials for specialty applications, profitability associated with premium differentiated products, strong customer relationships, leading competitive positions, and the value proposition of selling a relatively low-cost yet critical component of an end-product.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Segment Financial Information. We operate and manage two reportable segments based on our product lines: Engineered Papers and Advanced Materials & Structures. In October 2015, the Company consolidated its former Paper and Reconstituted Tobacco segments into one reportable segment, Engineered Papers, conforming to the new organizational structure and strategic management of the former Paper and Reconstituted Tobacco segments, which largely supply the tobacco industry. The other reportable segment is Advanced Materials & Structures, which manufactures resin-based products used in specialty applications in the filtration, transportation, industrial, and medical end-markets. This segment is comprised of the four businesses we acquired from 2013 to 2016: DelStar, the Pronamic and SNN acquisitions, and Argotec, which the Company continues to integrate into a more holistically aligned operating segment. The Conwed acquisition, which closed on January 20, 2017, will be included in the reported AMS segment financial results beginning in 2017. As discussed further in "Description of Business - Recent Acquisition" and Note 23. Subsequent Events, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Conwed manufactures resin-based products used primarily in the infrastructure and construction end-markets.
Additional information regarding "Segment Performance" is included in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. In addition, selected financial data for our segments is available in Note 19. Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and a discussion regarding the risks associated with foreign operations is available in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Market Risk. In conjunction with the change in reportable segments, corresponding information for all prior periods presented has been restated to correspond to the presentation in the current year.
Financial information about foreign and domestic operations, contained under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation" appearing in Part II, Item 7 herein and in Notes 11, 12, 15 and 19 ("Restructuring and Impairment Activities," "Debt," "Income Taxes" and "Segment Information," respectively) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in Part II, Item 8 herein, is incorporated in this Item 1 by reference.
Engineered Papers
Products. Our EP segment produces both tobacco-related papers and non-tobacco-related papers. Our tobacco-related papers, which comprise a large majority of EP's sales, include various papers used in cigarette production and reconstituted tobacco leaf ("RTL"), which is often blended with virgin tobacco in a cigarette. 
One of our key cigarette paper products is low ignition propensity ("LIP") cigarette paper. LIP cigarettes are designed to self-extinguish when not actively being smoked, thus offering a fire-safety feature. The United States of America ("U.S."), the European Union ("E.U."), and several other smaller jurisdictions have mandated the use of LIP papers. The standards used in the U.S. and the E.U. regulations were largely based on SWM's technology, for which the Company maintains an extensive and active intellectual property portfolio. Our solutions pioneered this cigarette paper category, and we remain a leader in this cigarette paper sub-segment through either direct sales or through licensing agreements. 
RTL is another key product line, accounting for a significant portion of EP's total sales and profits. Cigarette manufacturers often blend RTL with virgin tobacco to achieve certain attributes in cigarettes, such as taste or reduced delivery of tar, nicotine, or other tobacco-related smoking constituents. Historically, the production of RTL has often been a cost-effective use for tobacco leaf scraps, though virgin leaf price volatility and industry inventory supply conditions can shift the relative attractiveness of our products. For the majority of our RTL production, our customers supply raw materials (tobacco scraps) for us to process into RTL and return. We also produce a similar line of reconstituted tobacco products, wrappers and binders for use in machine-made cigars.
Our non-tobacco paper products include a mix of lightweight papers including low-volume, high-value, engineered materials such as alkaline battery separator papers, as well as high-volume commodity paper grades for printing and writing, flooring laminates, and food service packaging, which are intended to maximize machine utilization. From 2014 through 2016, non-tobacco papers comprised approximately 11% of EP segment net sales. We intend to make 
 4

continued diversification investments in our EP segment to broaden our offerings, utilize existing machine capacity, and/or further monetize our paper making and reconstitution technologies.
Our wet-laid paper making technologies can be broadly classified into two main production processes: flat-wire production and incline-wire production. Generally, our machines are flat-wire, meaning a liquid slurry of short pulp fibers and water are laid onto flat-wire conveyor belts, with the water draining through the wire as the fibers (wood, flax, tobacco, etc.) bond together to form a paper sheet. Incline-wire machines allow for increased drainage, enabling the use of longer fibers which bond into a more open web, increasing the porosity. Incline wire machines are typically associated with higher-value products given this added porosity, which is important in filtration and other specialty applications that tend to justify premium pricing. 
Markets and Customers.  Our EP segment is heavily influenced by the global trends in cigarette consumption, particularly in the U.S., Brazil and the E.U., where we have the majority of our operations and highest share of the category's volume. Historically, mature geographic regions, such as the U.S. and the E.U. have exhibited a steady decline in smoking rates, often to the low-to-mid single digits, while smoking rates in Asia, especially China, and other developing economies, had shown consumption stability or growth. However, China (approximately 44% of global cigarette consumption) has recently transitioned to a mature/declining cigarette industry, driving overall annual declines in global cigarette consumption. The Chinese economy is closed to international tobacco companies, with domestic cigarette producers regulated and managed by China National Tobacco Corporation ("CNTC"). We participate in China through two joint ventures with CNTC, in which our 50/50 partners are either the monopoly itself and/or our customers. These results are not consolidated into our net sales and operating profits; SWM's share of the joint ventures' net income is classified as equity income from affiliates on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
We supply the major, and many of the smaller, cigarette and cigar manufacturers. We sell our products directly to the major tobacco companies or their designated converters in the Americas, Europe, Asia and elsewhere. Philip Morris-USA, a subsidiary of Altria Group Inc., Japan Tobacco Inc. ("JT"), and British American Tobacco ("BAT"), are our three largest customers and, together with their respective affiliates and designated converters, accounted for 35%, 42% and 46% of our 2016, 2015 and 2014 consolidated net sales, respectively. Although the total loss of one or more of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, we do not believe that such a loss is likely given our significance in the worldwide supply chain of cigarette-related papers.
Sales and Distribution. Our internal marketing, sales and customer service organizations sell most of our tobacco-related products directly to cigarette manufacturers or their designated converters. Most of our EP segment's non-tobacco related products are sold directly to manufacturers. In some geographic regions, we use sales agents. We do not sell our products directly to consumers or advertise our products in consumer media. We typically deliver our products to customers by truck, rail and ocean-going vessels. As is typical in our industry, ownership of the product generally transfers to our customer upon shipment from our mills, except for certain export sales where ownership typically transfers at the foreign port or customer facility.
Competition.  The specialized nature of our tobacco-related papers requires unique papermaking equipment, technical expertise, and research and development capabilities to meet exacting customer specifications. These factors have limited the number of competitors capable of servicing global cigarette manufacturers.
We estimate that our share of global sales of cigarette paper is approximately 36%, excluding China. This share estimate is based on cigarette paper that surrounds the tobacco, not ancillary papers such as tipping paper and plug wrap. As the sole domestic producer of cigarette papers in North America and Latin America (SWM production in Brazil), we believe that we have a significant majority of the category share in those regions. Our paper mills in France and LIP printing facility in Poland sell a large amount of their products in the E.U. We estimate that we have a direct share of more than 40% of cigarette paper sales in the E.U., and coupled with royalty payments from a key competitor to which we have licensed our LIP technology, we believe we are able to monetize over 80% of the LIP-compliant E.U. cigarette market. Our principal competitors include delfortgroup AG (" delfort"), which licenses our LIP technology, Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A. ("Miquel y Costas"), Julius Glatz GmbH and PT Bukit Muria Jaya ("BMJ"). We believe that the basis of cigarette and our non-tobacco papers competition is price, consistent quality, security of supply, and level of technical service. 
 5

Outside of China, SWM is the only non-cigarette company that produces RTL through a paper-making process. Some cigarette companies such as Philip Morris-USA, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, JT and STMA (China) produce RTL primarily for their own internal use. Our customers' cigarette blending decisions, which affect our RTL sales volumes, can be influenced by worldwide virgin tobacco prices and availability as well as the general attractiveness of various competing in-house reconstituted tobacco products. Huabao International Holdings Ltd, a Hong Kong company, produces reconstituted tobacco in China. We believe that the basis of competition in this geographic region is primarily quality and price.
Raw Materials and Energy. Wood pulp is the primary fiber used in our EP segment. Our operations consumed approximately 72,000 metric tons of wood pulp in both 2016 and 2015, all of which we purchased. While EP uses other specialty fibers, such as flax, in our operations, we believe that purchased raw materials are generally available from several sources.
Paper production uses significant amounts of energy, primarily electricity, natural gas and fuel oil. We believe that energy supply is generally reliable throughout our manufacturing footprint, although prices can fluctuate significantly based on demand. We enter into agreements to procure a portion of our energy requirements for future periods in order to reduce the uncertainty of future energy costs. 
Additional information regarding agreements for the supply of certain raw materials and energy is included in Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Backlog and Seasonality. While our U.S., Polish and Brazilian EP operations do not calculate or maintain records of order backlogs, we typically receive forecasts of future demands from certain larger customers which are used to manage production and ensure sufficient supply of paper products. Our French paper operations order backlog was approximately $28 million and $21 million on December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Paper orders are typically received and shipped within a 30-day period. For RTL operations, order backlog was approximately $96 million and $111 million on December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and is typically filled within one fiscal year. 
The EP segment has historically experienced steady order flow. However, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015 and into the first half of 2016, we benefited from large customer-driven inventory builds of LIP papers in Europe ahead of an approaching regulatory change. This inventory build reversed in the second half of 2016, creating atypical seasonality in our quarterly financial results. Generally, sales of our paper and reconstituted tobacco products are subject to seasonal fluctuations due to periodic machine downtime and typically lower order volumes in the fourth quarter. 
Advanced Materials & Structures
Products. We manufacture and sell a variety of highly engineered resin-based, rolled goods such as films, nets, foams and other non-wovens. These products are often used in growing specialty applications serving the filtration, transportation, industrial, and medical end-markets. Most of our production technologies are extrusion-based, meaning resin pellets are heated, softened, and forced through a metal die to form continuous sheets or strands. We also produce certain air-laid products and both machined and extruded plastic tubes. We have significant technological expertise in proprietary die construction, which our competitors often outsource, and we consider this an advantage in protecting our technology and competitive position. However, unlike the EP segment which relies primarily on patent protection for key innovation protection, AMS relies more heavily on trade secrets and manufacturing "know-how." 
We manufacture our thermoplastic polyurethane films ("TPU") to have combinations of the following attributes; UV, scratch, and water resistance, "breathability" (e.g., to allow air flow in a skin-contact medical application), and ultra-clarity. The ability to demonstrate these rare combinations make them ideally suited for demanding transportation-related surface protection applications, primarily automotive paint protection and security reinforced glass. These products are also used in certain niche applications such as graphics and laminated textiles in the industrial end-market, and also the medical end-market. Other films, including apertured film products, are used in wound care applications, such as finger bandages, wound dressings, and other hospital-setting products for the medical end-market. Our apertured film products are also used in specialty liquid filters for ultra-pure semiconductor manufacturing processes.
 6

Our thermoplastic nets are used in a variety of applications, the most prominent of which is their use as spacer netting in spiral wound reverse osmosis water filtration (“RO filtration) devices. We have established a strong presence in this specialty application by customizing products to meet demanding customer specifications, such as thickness/weight, aperture performance, and heat and pressure resistance. Our nets are also used in a variety of industrial and life science filter applications such as fuel and hydraulic fluid filters, pharmaceutical filters, semiconductor filters, and food and beverage filters. They can also be found in a variety of packaging (i.e., retail food packaging) and protection applications (i.e., casings for underground pipelines).
Our non-wovens are typically air-laid resin-based materials often used in liquid filtration and residential and commercial air filtration and our foams are mainly sold as components in wound care products. In addition to rolled goods, SWM also manufactures rigid core tubing, an extruded resin product that also is primarily used in reverse osmosis water filtration devices, and flexible tubing used in various medical and industrial applications.
Markets and Customers. The AMS segment supplies specialty products mainly to customers producing finished goods serving the filtration, surface protection, medical, and industrial end-segments. These products are highly engineered and often customized. In some cases, we are the sole supplier of certain products to our top customers, though no customer represents more than 10% of our consolidated net sales.
Generally, the applications, customers, and end-markets the AMS segment serves are growing, which acts to counterbalance smoking attrition and its impact on our consolidated net sales. Within the filtration end-market, reverse osmosis water filtration has exhibited long-term growth, and we expect it to continue to do so due to current and expected global demand for drinkable water. Many countries rely on RO filtration as their primary water desalination technology to produce drinkable water, and we expect infrastructure investments in the U.S. and overseas to continue long-term. Sales of our other filtration products, particularly those used in the oil, gas, and mining sectors, have historically exhibited steady growth; however, they are subject to cyclicality and commodity price volatility and were particularly adversely impacted by significant declines in global commodity markets, which began in 2015. Our products are used in heavy equipment and machinery used in the oil and gas industries, often filtering fuel and other hydraulic liquids, as well as serving other functions in the exploration, processing, and transport of oil, gas, and metals. These applications and other non-water liquid filtration products can be generally referred to as process filtration.

The majority of our TPU film sales are concentrated in the domestic transportation end-market and are mostly used in transportation-related surface protection applications, specifically automotive paint protection. As a result, they are impacted by the U.S. auto industry. Other surface protection applications, such as bulletproof and security glass used primarily on vehicles are heavily impacted by government and military contracts. Our industrial applications are spread across a variety of other industries, such as apparel, food manufacturing, graphics and energy, while our medical film products largely serve the wound care management area of the medical end-market.
Sales and Distribution. AMS products are primarily sold by the marketing, sales and customer service organizations of our AMS operations directly to manufacturers and, in some geographic regions, we use sales agents to assist us in the sales process. As part of our enterprise transformation and integration efforts related to our recently acquired companies, we are rebranding the acquired companies and transitioning our AMS sales operations toward a more unified organization. Prior to this transition, DelStar and Argotec operated largely independently under their respective business trade names. Moving forward, all acquired companies will rebrand as SWM and the AMS sales organization will operate and go-to-market under the SWM trade name, with sales resources deployed by end-market and focused on selling products from across the total AMS offerings. As part of this transition, the DelStar and Argotec trade names will be mostly discontinued, resulting in the revaluing and impairment of various related intangible assets. Product-level trade names and brand names will remain in use for marketplace continuity. The financial impact of this change is further detailed in Note 9. Intangible Assets, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Information. 
Similar to the EP segment, we typically deliver our products to customers by truck, rail and ocean-going vessels. As is typical in the industries in which we operate, ownership of the product generally transfers to our customer upon shipment from our manufacturing facilities, except for certain export sales where ownership typically transfers at the foreign port or customer facility. In certain instances, we produce and hold or consign products for a limited number 
 7

of customers for which title does not transfer until shipment from our manufacturing facility or the products are used by the customer. In these instances, we defer recognition of revenue related to these products until the products are shipped, or the product is used, as the case may be, and ownership of the product transfers to the customer.
Competition. Our AMS products are typically leaders in their respective categories and compete against niche products made by competitors such as Marshall Manufacturing Company, Johns Manville, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Shaoxing Naite Plastics Co. Ltd., 3M Company, Covestro AG, and Hollingsworth and Vose Company. We believe our AMS products compete primarily on product features, innovations and customer service across the end-markets we serve. Of the end-markets we serve, industrial is generally the most price competitive due to a higher portion of commodity-type products that we often sell in order to maximize our machine utilization. As part of our overall strategic focus on high-value specialty products, we have elected to discontinue and/or reduce our efforts to sell some of our lower-margin products and have streamlined capacity accordingly, and will continue to rationalize our portfolio to maintain focus on our most profitable products. 
Raw Materials and Energy. The primary raw material used in our AMS products is plastic resin, and we rely on a variety of commodity grade and specialty resins, including Polypropylene, Polyurethane, Polyethylene, Polyamide (nylon) and a selection of specialized high temperature engineering grade resins. Our TPU films are produced using specialty resins which are significantly more expensive than commodity grade resins. Our thermoplastic nets and apertured films are produced using a blend of specialty resins and commodity grade resins like polypropylene. Resin prices fluctuate significantly and can impact profitability. To partially mitigate the effects of such fluctuations, we have contractual pricing adjustment mechanisms with certain customers. Commodity grade resin prices typically correlate with crude oil prices while specialty resin prices often do not. 
We have multiple sources for most of our resin needs. However, some of our resins are supplied by one or a few manufacturers. We believe that our purchased raw materials are generally available from several sources and that the loss of a single supplier would not likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to procure needed raw materials from other suppliers. Our total resin purchases in 2016 and 2015 totaled $95 million and $54 million, respectively. The increase in 2016 resin purchases is due to a full year of purchases by Argotec included in our 2016 results.
The majority of our energy requirements relate to electricity in the U.S. We consider this to be a relatively stable energy source.
Backlog and Seasonality. In the AMS segment, customer orders are generally manufactured and shipped within 30 days or, in certain instances, within three months. Sales of our products within AMS are generally not subject to seasonal fluctuations. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the AMS segment order backlog was approximately $39 million and $44 million, respectively.
Recent Acquisition
On January 20, 2017, after the close of the 2016 fiscal year, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of Conwed Plastics LLC from Leucadia National Corporation, a publicly traded diversified holding company. The purchase price to acquire Conwed was $295 million in cash, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments, plus three potential earn-out payments not to exceed $40 million, in the aggregate, which payments are contingent upon the achievement of certain financial metrics in each of 2019, 2020 and 2021, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Purchase Agreement. Conwed is a leading producer of resin-based netting solutions with proprietary manufacturing processes and innovative technologies. 
Conwed’s primary technology is resin extrusion for thermoplastic netting which provides diversification to SWM by serving different markets than those served by SWM’s existing AMS segment operations. Regarding intellectual property, the Company relies primarily on manufacturing know-how and “trade secrets.” Similar to the AMS segment, Conwed’s primary raw material usage relates to commodity grade resins such as polypropylene, for which prices often correlate with oil commodity markets. Conwed’s operations are expected to be highly synergistic with existing AMS segment operations, with primary acquisition value drivers including manufacturing footprint optimization, resin sourcing, and cross-selling. SWM will integrate Conwed into the AMS segment. 
 8

Approximately 70% of Conwed’s sales serve the infrastructure and construction end-markets, with netting products providing critical functionality in erosion and sediment control applications for highway infrastructure development, and oil and gas exploration. Netting is a component of erosion control blankets, which provide stability on sloped or altered landscapes, holding disturbed sediment in place. This application area is primarily driven by U.S. highway infrastructure spending. Similarly, in the oil and gas industry, Conwed’s products are used in site development as a component of a filled sock used to control sediment and prevent environmental contaminants from flowing outside the drilling site. U.S. drilling activity and share gains through further adoption of Conwed’s technology by oil and gas site managers are the primary demand drivers for this application. These products are also used in low-impact development and storm water management applications to mitigate environmental risks. Conwed’s key construction-related applications include support netting for carpet cushions and sod production which are largely driven by residential home construction in the U.S. The remaining 30% of sales are split between filtration and industrial end-markets.
Conwed is typically the leader in its key applications, often competing with manufacturers of similar products. We believe Conwed’s products compete primarily on product features, innovations and customer service across the infrastructure, construction and filtration end-markets, while the industrial area is generally the most price competitive due to a higher portion of commodity-type products. Conwed typically sells either directly to customers or to converters through an internal salesforce, which will be integrated into AMS’s realigned sales organization.
Research and Development
As of December 31, 2016 we employ approximately 70 research and development employees in research and laboratory facilities in France, Brazil, Poland, and the U.S. We are dedicated to developing product innovations and improvements to meet the needs of individual customers. We expensed $17.5 million in 2016, $14.0 million in 2015 and $15.7 million in 2014 on research and development. We believe that our research and product development capabilities have played an important role in establishing our reputation for high quality, superior products in both our EP and AMS segments. Within EP, our research and development has enabled us to establish and sustain leading shares in various cigarette paper products, specifically LIP paper. We also are working with customers to meet potential future demand for reduced-harm tobacco products. Within AMS, we have a history of finding innovative design solutions, including developing products that improve the performance of customers' products and manufacturing operations. We believe that our commitment to research and development, coupled with our investment in new technology and equipment, has positioned us to take advantage of growth opportunities in many places around the world.
Patents and Trademarks
As of December 31, 2016, we owned 103 patents and had 202 pending patent applications in our EP segment, covering a variety of cigarette papers, RTL, cigar wrapper and binder and other products and processes in the U.S., Western Europe and several other countries. We believe that our patents, together with our papermaking expertise and technical sales support, have been instrumental in establishing us as the leading worldwide supplier of cigarette papers. We believe that patents have contributed to our position as the world's leading independent producer of papers used for LIP cigarettes. 
Management believes that in the EP segment, our "ALGINEX®" water-based technology trademark, our "GLUCIGENTM" trademark for use in banded papers for the production of LIP cigarettes, and the "SWM" logo and trade names have been important contributors to the marketing of our products. Further, we have developed, individually or in conjunction with customers, technologies to address the demand for cigarette paper for LIP cigarettes in the U.S., Canada, Australia and the E.U. We have licensed to others the right to use certain of our LIP intellectual property, excluding ALGINEX® related intellectual properties.
As of December 31, 2016, we owned 49 patents and had 96 pending patent applications in our AMS segment, none of which are material to our operations. 
In our AMS segment, as described in the branding initiative discussed above, SWM made a strategic decision to transition away from certain legacy business trade names associated with our recent acquisitions in favor of a streamlined 
 9

SWM enterprise branding approach. Thus, the Company recognized an impairment of our DelStar trade name asset, as further described in Note 9. Intangible Assets, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Information. The Company will continue to market its products under the long-standing product-level brand names and trademarks such as "NALTEX®", "DELNET®", “ARGOGUARD®” and “ARGOTHANE®”.
Management of a large portion of SWM's research and development activities is provided from our Luxembourg City, Luxembourg operation ("SWM Luxembourg"). These activities are often performed at other SWM locations under contract by SWM Luxembourg, and funded by SWM Luxembourg. SWM Luxembourg has the authority to initiate and manage research and development projects in areas such as, but not limited to, LIP, our non-tobacco products unit (Advanced Fibers and Materials) and AMS. This operation also provides global oversight and active management for much of the Company's intellectual property rights.
Administrative and Court Proceedings Regarding Papers for Lower Ignition Propensity Cigarettes 
In December 2009, Miquel y Costas, Société Papéteries du Léman SAS (“PdL”), and delfortgroup AG filed Notices of Opposition to granting by the European Patent Office's ("EPO") of our European Patent EP 1482815. The opponents submitted various contentions challenging the sufficiency of disclosure of the claimed invention. Delfortgroup and Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A. subsequently withdrew their opposition after reaching separate settlements with the Company. On January 23, 2015, the Opposition Division of the EPO issued a written decision to maintain the patent in amended form. The EPO's decision was appealed by PdL and Julius Glatz GmbH (“Glatz”) intervened in the appeal. On September 16, 2016, the Board of Appeals of the EPO rejected the appeal. As a result, the patent remains in effect and is enforceable with no further appeals possible with the EPO.
On November 11, 2010, the EPO issued a Decision to Grant SWM European Patent No. 1333729. In December 2010, Glatz filed a Notice of Opposition to the grant of this patent, and in 2011, PdL, delfortgroup, and Miquel y Costas each also filed opposition papers, although PdL and delfortgroup subsequently withdrew from the proceedings. In its hearing in January 2015, the Opposition Division of the EPO revoked the patent, a decision that was upheld by the Board of Appeals on September 27, 2016. No further appeals by SWM are possible.
On June 27, 2012, the EPO granted the Company's applications for two LIP-related patents, EP 2127544 and EP 2127545, that are based on divisional applications related to European Patent No. 1333729. Glatz and Miquel y Costas each filed Notices of Opposition to the grant of EP 2127544. Glatz, Miquel y Costas and PdL each filed Notices of Opposition to the grant of EP 2127545. In its hearing on February 22, 2016, the Opposition Division of the EPO revoked EP 2127545 as insufficiently drafted. The Company believes that the EPO properly granted the patent and appealed the decision. In light of the revocation of EP 1333729, however, which patent is related to EP 2127545, there can be no assurance that the Company’s appeal will be successful.
On September 12, 2012, the EPO granted the Company's LIP-related patent, EP 2127543, which is based on a divisional application related to European Patent No. 1333729. PdL, Glatz and Miquel y Costas each filed Notices of Opposition. In its hearing on February 26, 2016, the Opposition Division of the EPO upheld the validity of the EP 2127543 patent. The parties opposing the patent have appealed the decision. The patent remains in effect and enforceable while opposition appeal proceedings are pending. The Company believes that the decision of the Opposition Division was correct and intends to vigorously defend the appeal of such decision.
On April 16, 2014, the EPO granted the Company's LIP-related patent, EP 2319333, which is based on a divisional application related to European Patent No. 1845810. Glatz filed a Notice of Opposition in January 2015. In its hearing on February 16, 2017, the Opposition Division of the EPO upheld the validity of the EP 2319333 patent in amended form. The decision is subject to appeal.
In January 2015, the Company initiated patent infringement proceedings in Germany against Glatz under multiple LIP-related patents. In partial response to the infringement action, Glatz initiated a nullity action against the German part of EP 0870437, one of the four patents asserted by the Company in the lawsuit. The Company believes that the EP 0870437 patent is valid and intends to vigorously defend the patent. The cost, timing and outcome of intellectual 
 10

property litigation can be unpredictable and thus no assurances can be given as to the outcome or impact on us of such litigation.

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 3,000 regular, full-time, active employees.
North American Operations. Hourly employees at the Spotswood, New Jersey, and Ancram, New York mills are represented by locals of the United Steel Workers Union. The two-year collective bargaining agreement with employees at our Spotswood mill is effective through July 28, 2018.

Environmental Matters
Capital expenditures for environmental controls to meet legal requirements and those relating to the protection of the environment at our facilities in the U.S., United Kingdom, France, Brazil, Poland, China and Canada were $2.8 million in 2016, no material amount of which was the result of environmental fines or settlements. We expect such expenditures to be $1.0 million or less in each of the next two years, of which no material amounts are expected to be the result of environmental fines or settlements. These expenditures are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or competitive position; however, these estimates could be modified as a result of changes in our plans, changes in legal requirements or other factors.
Working Capital
We normally maintain approximately 50 to 90 days of inventories to support our operations. Our sales terms average between 15 and 60 days for payment by our customers, dependent upon the products and market segment served. With respect to our accounts payable, we typically carry approximately 15 to 40 days outstanding, in accordance with our purchasing terms, which vary by business location. The accounts payable balance varies in relation to changes in our manufacturing operations, particularly due to changes in prices of wood pulp, resins and purchased energy and the level and timing of capital expenditures related to projects in progress.
