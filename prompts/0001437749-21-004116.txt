Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Background
 
We were formed as a Delaware corporation on June 20, 2014 for the purpose of engaging in the business of recycling lead through a novel, proprietary and patent-pending process that we developed and named “AquaRefining”. Since our formation, we have focused our efforts on the development and testing of our AquaRefining process, the development of our business plan, the raise of our present working capital and the development of our initial lead acid battery, or LAB, recycling facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, McCarran, Nevada (“TRIC”).
 
We completed the development of our first LAB recycling facility at Nevada’s Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, or TRIC, in McCarran, Nevada and commenced production of battery breaking and limited operations during the first quarter of 2017. In April 2017, we commenced the shipment of products for sale, consisting of lead compounds as well as plastics. In April 2018, we commenced the limited production of lead bullion, including AquaRefined lead. In July 2018, we commenced the sale of pure AquaRefined lead in the form of two tonne blocks and in October 2018 we commenced the sale of AquaRefined lead in the form of battery manufacturing ready ingots. In November 2018, we received official vendor certification from Clarios for our AquaRefined lead and, in December 2018, we commenced shipments directly to Clarios owned and partner battery manufacturing facilities. In 2019, we operated our demonstration AquaRefinery at commercial quantity production levels and produced over 35,000 AquaRefined ingots by operating the AquaRefinery twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week for sustained periods of time. The AquaRefining Aqualyzer produced at or above the target 100 Kg/Hr of production throughput per module of six Aqualyzers or ~ 16-17 Kg/Hr per Aqualyzer and ran sustained endurance runs for over one month several times.
 
On the evening of November 29, 2019, a fire occurred in the AquaRefining area of the recycling facility at TRIC. The cause of the fire was not due to the technology or process of AquaRefining, but rather due to contracting activities. The fire and related intense heat and smoke caused significant damage to a material amount of equipment in the AquaRefinery area, including all sixteen AquaRefining modules, electrical and tank infrastructure, steel superstructure, control wiring and other supporting infrastructure. The floor to ceiling firewall between the AquaRefining area and the rest of the plant isolated the worst of the damage to the AquaRefining area. The firewall also appears to have spared material damage to much of the key front-end process equipment, such as the battery breaker/separation system, concentrate production area, kettles and ingot casting, water treatment and recovery and other important areas of the plant. The administrative office area also remained intact.
 
As of the date of the fire, we had in place $50 million dollars in combined property, equipment and business interruption insurance. As of the date of this report, we have received approximately $23.5 million of insurance proceeds from our insurance carriers, of which $7.9 million was used to retire in full a credit facility encumbered by the land, facility and equipment at TRIC. As of the date of this report, we believe that the replacement value of the equipment and plant lost or damaged in the fire will likely be higher. We have also submitted a significant claim on our business interruption policy. We intend to vigorously pursue receipt of insurance proceeds to satisfy in full all of our property, casualty and business interruption losses, subject to the coverage limits. Assets on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 that were not affected by the fire total approximately $24.9 million in book value, including the battery breaker, melting kettles, kiln, filter presses, mixing and storage tanks, water recovery system and the building infrastructure plus the land.
 
Following the November 2019 fire, we have been engaged in the pursuit of a capital light strategy that is based on the pursuit of licensing opportunities within the lead battery recycling marketplace. We believe our capital light business strategy will require less space and less equipment and focus on the needs of our future licensees. As of the date of this report, we have accelerated our capital light business strategy, designed to optimize shareholder value by focusing on equipment supply and licensing opportunities, which have always been a core part of our business plans. We believe this path has the potential to maximize shareholder value in that it could be far less capital intensive than a plant rebuild and could be funded solely or primarily from a combination of cash on hand, insurance proceeds and asset dispositions.
 
During the first half of 2020, we successfully performed test runs on the first and second iterations of our Aqualyzer as part of our V1.25L program. The program consists of three iterations that are classified as V1.25a, V1.25b and the final iteration, V1.25L, the latter of which will be used to create the AquaRefining Aqualyzer package for our equipment supply and licensing offerings. In December 2020, we completed our V1.25L Aqualyzer program on time and under budget, achieving lead production that is 100% greater compared to the V1.0 Aqualyzer deployed at the AquaRefinery during commercial production in 2018 and 2019. The V1.25L program concluded with a multi-day endurance run for twenty-four hours and seven days a week that ended on December 24, 2020. The V1.25L doubled the throughput compared to the V1.0 Aqualyzer, resulting in a 50% reduction in the number of Aqualyzers needed for equivalent lead production. The V1.25L also has a lower build cost and reduced assembly time compared to the V1.0 Aqualyzer, which correlates to a 50% decrease in capital expenditures for AquaRefining equipment installations. In addition, Aqualyzer operating expenses have been reduced by greater than 60% compared to the V1.0 Aqualyzer. We believe that the V1.25L Aqualyzer is commercially ready for licensing and sale, and we hope to conclude our initial AquaRefining licensing transaction in the second quarter of 2021, of which there can be no assurance.

Overview
 
Aqua Metals is seeking to reinvent lead recycling with its patented and patent pending AquaRefining™ technology. Unlike smelting, AquaRefining is a room temperature, water-based process. Lead is a globally traded commodity with a worldwide market value in excess of $20 billion. Lead acid batteries (LABs) are the primary consumer use of all lead produced in the world. Because the chemical and metallurgical properties of lead allow it to be recycled and reused indefinitely, LABs are also the dominant feed source for lead production across the world. As such, LABs are almost 100% recycled for purposes of capturing the lead contained therein for re-use. We believe that our proprietary and patented AquaRefining process will provide for the existing LAB recycling facility to leverage our capabilities for expanded production of a much higher purity lead with fewer environmental and regulatory issues than is possible with the current conventional methods of lead production.

In recent years, recycled lead has become increasingly important to LAB production. Recycled lead surpassed mined lead in the 1990s and now represents more than 65% of the lead content in new LABs. Whether it is produced from lead ore or recycled LABs, lead has historically been produced by smelting. Smelting is a high-temperature, metallurgical/chemical reduction, energy intensive and often a highly polluting process. As a consequence of the environmental and health issues, lead smelting has become increasingly regulated in many countries. In the U.S., regulatory non-compliance has forced the closure of large lead smelters in Vernon, California, Frisco, Texas and Herculaneum, Missouri over the last several years. In response to increasing environmental regulation over the past three decades, there has been an expansion of LAB smelting capacity in Mexico and other less regulated countries. The resulting transportation of used LABs from where they originate in the U.S. to smelters in Mexico, South Korea, the Philippines and elsewhere is an increasingly significant logistical and global environmental cost.
 
AquaRefining uses a bio-degradable aqueous solvent and a novel ambient temperature electro-chemical process to produce lead suitable for use in LAB production. Our AquaRefining process produces lead with a purity of 99.996+%, making it the purest lead ever made from a recycling technique that is in fact more pure than lead made from mining processes. We believe that AquaRefining can provide a more efficient production process as compared with alternative methods of producing equivalent grades of lead. For example, licensing the technology to facilities closest to the source of used LABs is more efficient due to minimization of transportation costs and supply chain bottlenecks. On this basis, we believe that AquaRefining reduces environmental plant emissions, health concerns and permitting needs compared with lead smelting. We believe that the combined advantages offered by AquaRefining represent a potential step change in lead recycling technology that includes improved product quality, advantages in footprint and logistics as well as reduced environmental impact.
 
The modular nature of AquaRefining makes it possible both to start LAB recycling at a smaller scale than is possible with a typical smelter setup and to add AquaRefining to existing battery recycling operations to expand production capacity or to reduce smelting processes. Our plan is to pursue the licensing of our AquaRefining technology. This strategy is designed to supply AquaRefining and supporting equipment to battery recyclers to improve emissions, throughput and product quality from their battery recycling operations.
 
Our Markets
 
The Lead Market
 
Lead is a globally traded metal commodity and is the essential component of over 80% of the world’s rechargeable batteries. Lead is globally traded primarily on the London Metals Exchange (LME), although the smaller Shanghai Metals Exchange (SHME) in China also trades the element. Conventionally in the industry, there are two separate groupings of lead: i) primary lead which refers to lead produced at primary smelters that use mined lead concentrates (generally lead sulfide) as their major feedstock, and ii) secondary lead which refers to lead smelters utilizing LABs as their main feed source.
 
Originally, the majority of the lead used in batteries was sourced from primary smelters but in recent decades, secondary lead has grown to become the dominate product used. Industry data shows that six million metric tons of lead was produced in 1995, of which approximately 45% was from primary and 55% was from secondary sources. Twenty years later, by 2015, global lead production had increased to approximately 11 million metric tons, of which more than 65% was secondary. Importantly, primary lead production had increased only marginally during this period. This marginal increase is partially due to lead-zinc mine deposits being depleted across the globe in existing mines. As such, an increasing quantity of primary lead is now the predominate byproduct of zinc mining.
 
In 2005, secondary lead traded on the LME in a range of $1,000 to $1,200 per metric ton. During 2020, secondary lead traded in a range of approximately $1,600 to $2,000 per metric ton.
 
As noted above, although lead is traded as a commodity on the LME/SHME, the major sales are directly between producers/traders and users (whom are typically battery manufacturers). The LME daily price is used as the benchmark in forming the basis of physical trades, forward contracts and hedge strategies for both primary and secondary lead. Based on market and product knowledge with buyers of lead in the U.S. and Global lead markets, different grades (termed alloys) of lead are traded at a premium to the base LME price. Lead alloys, which are generally specifically designed for the customer, are also sold at a premium above the base LME, whereas byproducts (generally lead compounds or scrap) are traded at a discount to the LME as they are based on the lead content and its form.

Lead Smelting
 
Currently, smelters produce virtually all the world’s mined and recycled lead. Smelting is an energy-intensive and, in some poorly managed plants, a highly polluting process. At its core, smelting is a relatively high temperature (excess of 900°C) metallurgical reduction process in which lead compounds are heated and reacted with various reducing agents to remove the oxygen, sulfur, and other impurities. The process leaves behind bullion lead and waste slag. In smelting, depending upon the operation, 0.5% to 5% of the lead can be lost to the “slag”, with the resultant lead bullion containing both wanted and unwanted impurities.
 
In developed countries, there is both increased environmental regulation and enforcement of such, including monitoring of permissible blood lead levels in employees and local populations. These regulations and the increasing enforcement have made it more expensive to operate smelters. According to a report titled “Hazardous Trade?” produced by the Secretariat of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in 2013, this has led to a decline of lead smelters in the U.S., an expansion of smelting operations in Mexico and a resultant increase in the export of used LABs from the U.S. followed by the re-import of recycled lead. This trade is believed to be largely driven by the lower costs related to the less stringent environmental standards and enforcement in Mexico. For the foregoing reasons, we believe that lead smelting facilities are increasingly located in less regulated areas remote from both the source of used LABs and the demand for lead. We believe that the remote location of smelting increases the transport costs to the production of recycled lead.
 
Lead Acid Batteries
 
Although the LAB is one of the earliest battery technologies, in terms of energy capacity deployed and installed manufacturing capacity, it still dominates the battery industry today. Historically, the largest market for LABs has been as starter batteries for vehicles. However, with the increasing electrical load on modern vehicles and the adoption of “Stop-Start” conventional 12V “starter batteries”, LABs are evolving into more capable and higher value products. At the same time, large new markets such as Cell Tower, Data Center and Industrial back-up are adding to demand. Consequently, existing LAB production facilities are being expanded and new facilities are being built.
 
According to Grand View Research, annual lead acid battery sales are expected to nearly double to $84 billion by 2025, driving demand for lead. Similar prospects for healthy growth in the lead industry continue to be published and support continued growth in demand for lead for at least the next 20 years. We believe that grid storage and other energy storage applications linked to renewable energy (solar and wind) will also generate increased demand for LABs, where low cost, safety and reliability will make them attractive options.
 
    4 

  

The increase in LAB manufacturing in general and particularly in China, India and Southeast Asia, has increased demand for lead, putting pressure on global recycling networks to meet this demand. At present, we believe that much of the LAB recycling performed outside of the U.S., Canada, the EU, Japan, and Australia is carried out in outdated facilities with poor environmental standards and insufficient enforcement. China, India, Pakistan and South America appear to be moving toward tougher regulation and enforcement. We believe that this will drive a demand in foreign markets for more less polluting LAB recycling processes.
 
AquaRefining Process
 
We developed AquaRefining to be a cleaner and modular alternative to smelting. Our process has two key elements, both of which are integral to our issued patents and pending-patent applications. The first is our use of a proprietary, non-toxic solvent that dissolves lead compounds. The second is a proprietary electro-chemical process and Aqualyzer that converts the dissolved lead compounds into high purity lead suitable for use in LAB production.
 
Similar to conventional LAB smelter recycling, our AquaRefining process begins with the crushing of used LABs and the separation of the metallic lead, active material (lead compounds), sulfuric acid and plastic for recycling. The active material (lead compounds) are first processed to remove sulfur and then dissolved in our solvent. Lead is then plated from the solvent using our patented and patent-pending process allowing the solvent to be reused.
 
Our AquaRefining process can generate the following outputs:
 

• | Lead and lead-based products, including high purity lead, lead alloys and lead compounds which are primarily intended for the LAB industry. We are also exploring higher value lead-based products which may offer performance and life-cycle benefits to the LAB industry; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Recovered plastic chips, intended for re-use in the manufacture of battery casings and other recycled plastic products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A significant benefit of our AquaRefining process is that it is capable of producing higher purity product than that derived from primary smelters with product from secondary sources. As indicated above, primary grade lead is generally sold directly to battery companies.
 
Another significant benefit of our process is that we designed our AquaRefining equipment to be manufactured on a purpose-built production line in standard sized Aqualyzers. This is not possible with the smelting process, as smelters need to be constructed on site. This gives us the ability to provide AquaRefining systems with capacities ranging from eight metric tons per day to more than 800 metric tons per day all based on our recently enhanced standard Aqualyzer. We have also developed an integrated software and portal that keeps track of lead production and key operating metrics.
 
Lead recycling is subject to a variety of domestic and international regulations related to hazardous materials, emissions, employee safety and other matters. While our operations will be subject to these regulations, we believe that one of our potential advantages will be our ability to conduct lead recycling operations with less regulatory cost and burden than smelting operators due to the nature of our process. One of our key objectives will be to educate regulators and the public as to the environmental benefits of AquaRefining. We believe that we have the potential to develop a business model that offers the opportunity to conduct, in an environmentally friendly manner, an important recycling activity that historically has been conducted in an often highly polluting manner.
 
Our Business Model
 
Overall, our objective is to progress the lead recycling industry from one which is based solely on smelting to one which is based on AquaRefining supplemented by smelting. The business model that we are currently most focused on is the supply of AquaRefining and supporting equipment and services to third parties to use in their recycling operations on a licensing model with running royalties to Aqua Metals for lead produced. We are currently focused on exploring this business stream through our relationship with Clarios and other existing smelters.
 
The market for lead is global in scale but local in nature and execution, with large differences in local regulation, custom and practice, and access to transportation and electricity costs. In some regions, it is highly regulated, and in others it is not. Consequently, we are evolving our business model to commercialize our technology optimally across multiple locations.

In the U.S. and similarly regulated countries, our plan is to supply AquaRefining technology to LAB recycling facilities, both directly and in association with third parties through joint ventures, licensing and direct sales. We intend to work with all potential parties that would be interested in our AquaRefining technology. As an example, on February 7, 2017, we entered into a series of agreements with Clarios (formerly Johnson Controls, Inc), pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to work with Clarios on the development of a program for upgrades of Clarios and certain strategic partners of Clarios' existing lead smelters throughout North and South America, China and Europe to a lead recycling process utilizing our proprietary and patented AquaRefining technology and equipment, know-how and services. In June 2019, we signed an agreement with Clarios setting parameters for finalizing a definitive development program. Those performance conditions, however, were based on the operation of up to 16 AquaRefining modules at TRIC, and our ability to meet these performance conditions is unlikely if the Company pursues a technology licensing business plan without rebuilding TRIC to its pre-fire status as discussed in the “Background” section above. We have initiated discussions with Clarios to revise the performance conditions, however as of the date of this report we have been unable to reach an agreement with Clarios on revised performance standards. If we are unable to agree with Clarios on revised performance standards, we may be unable to sell AquaRefining equipment or license our AquaRefining technology to third-parties until the expiration of the Equipment Supply Agreement in June 2021 or the agreement’s earlier termination. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude a definitive development agreement with Clarios on terms that benefit us, if at all. See "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business."
 
Competition
 
At the present time, our primary competition in the production of lead comes from operators of existing smelters and other parties heavily invested in the existing supply chain for smelting. Our approach to this competition is to make AquaRefining available for the conversion of existing smelter-based facilities. However, it is prudent to assume that outside of our strategic relationships, a conversion to AquaRefining may be resisted by some of the incumbent lead producers. Competition in the supply of lead from such incumbents may come in the form of price competition for lead produced. However, to the extent we are successful with partners in being a producer of high-quality lead without the regulatory costs or burden associated with smelting, we believe that we may be able to compete effectively with smelting as the preferred method of recycling lead, at least in the more regulated jurisdictions.
 
Secondary competition comes from other alternatives to lead smelting that are electrochemical based. There are a few groups that have run lab scale and bench tests but to date, no alternate technology has been commercialized to produce large quantities of consistent quality lead whereas Aqua Metals has already done so.
 
Licensing of our Technology
 
Our recycling facility located at TRIC was used in the previous years to prove out our AquaRefining process. During this time we began continuous production of AquaRefined lead and sold it at a premium to the London Metals Exchange ("LME"). We also received approved lead supplier status from Clarios and we shipped approximately 35,000 ingots directly to their battery manufacturing facility. We have invested over $200 million towards commercialization, filing 62 patent applications and having 51 patents issued or allowed in the U.S. and internationally for lead and other metals.
 
We have been engaged in the pursuit of a capital light strategy that is based on the pursuit of licensing opportunities within the lead battery recycling marketplace without maintaining and operating a capital-intensive lead recycling facility. Our capital light business strategy is designed to optimize shareholder value by focusing on equipment supply and licensing opportunities, which have always been a core part of our business plans. We believe this path has the potential to maximize shareholder value in that it could be far less capital intensive than a plant rebuild.
 
Revenues related to the licensing of our technology may include engineering services, equipment supply and recurring running royalties on lead production.

Clarios Agreements
 
Equipment Supply Agreement. We entered into an equipment supply agreement dated February 7, 2017 with Clarios, formerly Johnson Controls Inc., pursuant to which we agreed to collaborate on the development of a program for the installation of new greenfield builds and conversion of existing Clarios and certain strategic partners of Clarios existing lead smelters to a lead recycling process utilizing our proprietary and patent-pending AquaRefining technology and equipment, know-how and services. We have agreed with Clarios to develop an appropriate program blueprint, and enter into a definitive development program agreement reflecting that blueprint, pursuant to which we will provide to Clarios and certain strategic partners of Clarios, by way of licensing or sale, the following products and services in the regions of North and South America, Europe and China:

• | AquaRefining technology and the related equipment, engineering and systems integration support sufficient to convert or retrofit existing smelter-based operations and/or the construction of new Clarios and Clarios’ strategic partners’ battery recycling facilities based on our AquaRefining technology;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Training, evaluation and certification of Clarios’ operations personnel sufficient for such personnel to competently operate our AquaRefining technology and equipment; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ongoing technical support, maintenance services and warranties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
We plan to provide the above services and equipment to Clarios on a serviced license basis, including Clarios’ ongoing licensing fees payable to us based on the operational capacity of the AquaRefining equipment supplied by us. We have agreed not to license our AquaRefining technology and equipment to third parties in the aforementioned regions until such time as we and Clarios have agreed on a definitive development program agreement reflecting the above blueprint, including certain matters relating to the initial conversion of a Clarios facility. In June 2019, we entered into an agreement with Clarios to amend the equipment supply agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to use good faith, commercial best-efforts to conclude the discussion and negotiation of, and enter into, a development program agreement no later than the 90th day following our satisfaction of certain performance criteria agreed upon by Clarios and us, however those performance conditions were based on the operation of up to 16 AquaRefining modules at TRIC, which now seems unlikely. If we are unable to agree with Clarios on revised performance standards, we will be unable to sell AquaRefining equipment or license our AquaRefining technology to third-parties until the expiration of the equipment supply agreement in June 2021 or the agreement’s earlier termination. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate and conclude a definitive development program agreement with Clarios on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.
 
The equipment supply agreement allows each party the right to seek early termination based on a material breach by the other party that goes uncorrected for 30 days following notice of breach. The equipment supply agreement contains representations, warranties and indemnities that are customary to commercial agreements of this nature.
 
Tolling/Lead Purchase Agreement. We entered into a tolling/lead purchase agreement dated February 7, 2017 with Clarios pursuant to which we have agreed to sell to Clarios, and Clarios has agreed to purchase from us, recycled lead on both a tolling (fee to convert used LABs to recycled materials) and merchanting (sale of recycled materials) basis.
 
    7 

  

Pursuant to the agreement, Clarios has agreed to purchase from us, and we have agreed to sell to Clarios, up to 100% of the recycled lead we produce for automotive applications, other than by way of tolling arrangements, on a monthly basis, unless we receive notice from Clarios six months advance of its intention to purchase less than 100% of our output in any given month. Our agreement with Clarios excludes, and we are free to manufacture and sell to third parties, recycled lead for non-automotive uses, such as stationery batteries for back-up power systems for Internet/Cloud applications or grid scale storage applications. During fiscal year 2020 and 2019, approximately 16% and 69% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from sales to Clarios.
 
Veolia Agreement
 
 In February 2019, we entered into an Operations, Management and Maintenance Agreement with Veolia North America Regeneration Services, LLC, or Veolia. Pursuant to the Agreement, Veolia agreed to provide development of operations programs, start-up of new equipment and operations, maintenance and management services at our AquaRefining facility at TRIC. As a result of the November 2019 fire at TRIC, we have suspended all operations at TRIC pending our clean-up of the fire damage and development of our plan for resuming operations. In January 2020, we declared a force majeure under the Veolia Operations, Management and Maintenance Agreement and suspended payments to Veolia thereunder. The Veolia Operations, Management and Maintenance Agreement included an initial term expiring March 6, 2021 and an automatic renewal provision unless either party elects not to renew. We have elected not to renew the Veolia Operations, Management and Maintenance Agreement and it is presently scheduled to terminate on March 6, 2021. See "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business."
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We regard the protection of our technologies and intellectual property rights as an important element of our business operations and crucial to our success. We endeavor to generate and protect our intellectual property assets through a series of patents, trademarks, internal and external policy and procedures and contractual provisions.
Patent Portfolio
 
Currently, we have secured six US patents, 40 international patents, and five allowances (all international). In addition to the US patents, we have international patents/allowances in the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization, European Union, the Eurasian Patent Organization, Honduras, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Japan, China, Australia, Canada, African Intellectual Property Organization, Mexico, South Africa, Vietnam, and the Ukraine. We also have 62 US and foreign patent applications pending with patent applications pending in 20 additional non-US jurisdictions across seven distinct patent applications relating to certain elements of the technology underlying our AquaRefining process and related apparatus and chemical formulations. The claims of the granted patents substantially address the same subject matter and are drawn to various aspects of processing lead materials using an aqua refining process. Differences in the claim number and scope are due to local rules and practice.
 
We intend to continue to prepare and file domestic and foreign patent applications covering expanding aspects and applications of our technology, as circumstances warrant.
 
There can be no assurance that any patents will issue from any of our current or any future applications. Also, any patents that may issue may not survive a legal challenge to their scope, validity or enforceability, or provide significant protection for us. Competitors may work around our patents so they are not infringing. Our patent portfolio and our existing policy and procedures safeguarding our trade secrets nonetheless may face challenges so that our competitors can copy our AquaRefining process.

Trade Secrets and Contract Protection
 
We have developed our internal policy and procedures in safeguarding our trade secrets and proprietary information. Our procedures generally require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except under specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements provide that all of the technology that is conceived by the individual during the course of employment is our exclusive property. The development of our technology and many of our processes are dependent upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel.
Government Regulation
 
Our operations and the operations of our licensees in the United States will be subject to the federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws applicable to the reclamation of LABs. While the lead reclamation process itself is generally not subject to federal permitting requirements, depending on how any particular operation is structured, our facilities and the facilities our licensees may have to obtain environmental permits or approvals from federal, state or local regulators to operate, including permits or regulatory approvals related to air emissions, water discharges, waste management, and the storage of LABs on-site should that become necessary. We may face opposition from local residents or public interest groups to the installation and operation of our or our licensee's facilities. Failure to secure (or significant delays in securing) the necessary approvals could prevent us from pursuing some of our planned operations and adversely affect our business, financial results and growth prospects.
 
In addition to permitting requirements, our operations and the operations of our licensees are subject to environmental health, safety and transportation laws and regulations that govern the management of and exposure to hazardous materials such as the lead and acids involved in LAB reclamation. These include hazard communication and other occupational safety requirements for employees, which may mandate industrial hygiene monitoring of employees for potential exposure to lead. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject our business to significant penalties (civil or criminal) and other sanctions that could adversely affect our business. Changes to these regulatory requirements in the future could also increase our costs, require changes in or cessation of certain activities, and adversely affect the business.
 
The nature of our operations and the operations of our licensees involves risks, including the potential for exposure to hazardous materials such as lead, that could result in personal injury and property damage claims from third parties, including employees and neighbors, which claims could result in significant costs or other environmental liability. Our operations and the operations of our licensees also pose a risk of releases of hazardous substances, such as lead or acids, into the environment, which can result in liabilities for the removal or remediation of such hazardous substances from the properties at which they have been released, liabilities which can be imposed regardless of fault, and our business could be held liable for the entire cost of cleanup even if we were only partially responsible. Like any manufacturer, we and our licensees are also subject to the possibility that we may receive notices of potential liability in connection with materials that were sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), and comparable state statutes, which impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination, and for damages to natural resources. Liability under CERCLA is retroactive, and, under certain circumstances, liability for the entire cost of a cleanup can be imposed on any responsible party.
 
As our business expands outside of the United States, our licensed operations will be subject to the environmental, health and safety laws of the countries where we do business, including permitting and compliance requirements that address the similar risks as do the laws in the United States, as well as international legal requirements such as those applicable to the transportation of hazardous materials. Depending on the country or region, these laws could be as stringent as those in the US, or they could be less stringent or not as strictly enforced. In some countries in which we are interested in expanding our business, such as Mexico and China, the relevant environmental regulatory and enforcement frameworks are in flux and subject to change. Therefore, while compliance with these requirements will cause our business to incur costs, and failure to comply with these requirements could adversely affect our business, it is difficult to evaluate such potential costs or adverse impacts until such time as we decide to initiate operations in particular countries outside the United States.
