Overview 
 Party City Holdco is a Delaware corporation formed in 2012. It has no operating assets or operations. Party City Holdco owns 100% of PC Nextco Holdings, LLC (“PC Nextco”), which owns 100% of PC Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (“PC Intermediate”). PC Intermediate owns 100% of Party City Holdings Inc. (“PCHI”). PCHI or its direct or indirect subsidiaries conduct most of our operations. The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 80 Grasslands Road, Elmsford, New York 10523. 
 We are the leading party goods company by revenue in North America and, we believe, the largest vertically integrated supplier of decorated party goods globally by revenue. The Company is a popular one-stop shopping destination for party supplies, balloons, and costumes. In addition to being a great retail brand, the Company is a global, world-class organization that combines state-of-the-art manufacturing and sourcing operations, and sophisticated wholesale operations complemented by a multi-channel retailing strategy and e-commerce retail operations. The Company is a leading player in its category and vertically integrated in its breadth and depth. The Company designs, manufactures, sources and distributes party goods, including paper and plastic tableware, metallic and latex balloons, Halloween and other costumes, accessories, novelties, gifts and stationery throughout the world. The Company’s retail operations include approximately 875 specialty retail party supply stores

 (including franchise stores) throughout the United States and Mexico operating under the names Party City and Halloween City, and e-commerce websites, including through the domain name PartyCity.com and others.
 In addition to our retail operations, we are also one of the largest global designers, manufacturers and distributors of decorated consumer party products, with items found in over 40,000 retail outlets worldwide, including independent party supply stores, mass merchants, grocery retailers, e-commerce merchandisers and dollar stores. Our products are available in over 100 countries with the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Canada, Germany, Mexico and Australia among the largest end markets for our products outside of the United States.
 The 2005 combination of Amscan, which focused on the wholesale market, and Party City, which focused on the retail market, represented an important step in our evolution. Since the acquisition of Party City, we have steadily increased the selection of Amscan merchandise offered in our Party City stores from approximately 25% in 2005 to approximately 80% in 2019, additionally allowing us to capture multiple levels of gross margin on a significant portion of our retail sales. During 2019, 80% of the product that was sold by our retail operations was supplied by our wholesale operations with 24% of the product self-manufactured and 56% procured externally.    
 Industry Overview 
 We operate in the broadly defined retail party goods industry, which includes a $9 billion Halloween market. The party goods industry includes decorative paper and plastic tableware, costumes, decorations, accessories and balloons, all of which are supported by a range of suppliers from commodity paper goods producers to party goods manufacturers. 
 The retail landscape for decorated party goods is comprised primarily of party superstores, mass merchants, e-commerce merchandisers, craft stores, grocery retailers, and dollar stores. The party superstore is a preferred destination for party goods shoppers, similar to the dominance of specialty retailers in other categories such as home improvement. This is typically due to the superstore chain’s ability to offer a wider variety of merchandise at more compelling prices in a convenient setting as well as the knowledgeable staff often found at superstores. Other retailers that cater to the party goods market typically offer a limited assortment of party supplies and seasonal items. Mass and e-commerce retailers tend to focus primarily on juvenile and seasonal party goods, greeting cards and gift wrap. Mass and e-commerce retailers also maintain a significant share of the market for packaged Halloween costumes. Craft stores tend to focus on decorations and seasonal merchandise; and dollar stores on general and seasonal party goods items.
 Sales of party goods are fueled by everyday events such as birthdays, baby showers, weddings and anniversaries, as well as seasonal events such as holidays and other special occasions. As a result of numerous and diverse occasions, the U.S. party goods market enjoys broad demographic appeal. 
 Segments 
 We have two reporting segments: Retail and Wholesale. In 2019, we generated 74.6% of our total revenues from our retail segment and 25.4% of our total revenues from our wholesale segment. 
 Our retail operations generate revenue primarily through the sale of our party supplies, which are sold under the Amscan, Designware, Anagram and Costumes USA brand names, through our Party City stores, Halloween City stores and PartyCity.com. 
 Our wholesale revenues are generated from the sale of decorated party goods for all occasions, including paper and plastic tableware, accessories and novelties, costumes, metallic and latex balloons and stationery. Our products are sold at wholesale to party goods superstores (including our franchise stores), other party goods retailers, mass merchants, independent card and gift stores, dollar stores and e-commerce merchandisers.

 Retail Operations 
 Overview 
 After opening its first company-owned store in 1986, Party City has grown to become what we believe is the largest operator of owned and franchised party superstores by revenue in the United States. At the time of the combination of Party City and Amscan in 2005, Party City’s network consisted of 502 stores, including 254 franchised locations. The Party City network of stores has expanded since 2005 and is now approximately 875 superstore locations in the United States (inclusive of franchised stores). During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company performed a comprehensive review of its store locations aimed at improving the overall productivity of such locations (“store optimization program”) and, after careful consideration and evaluation of the store locations, the Company made the decision to accelerate the optimization of its store portfolio with the closure of approximately 55 stores which are primarily located in close proximity to other Party City stores. These closings should provide the Company with capital flexibility to expand into underserved markets. On October 1, 2019, as part of the store optimization program, the Company sold its Canadian-based Party City stores to a Canadian-based retailer and entered into a 10-year supply agreement under which the acquirer agreed to purchase product from the Company for such Party City stores, as well as the acquirer’s other stores.
 The following table shows the change in our company-owned Party City store network over the past three years (with the Canadian-based stores reflected in the 100 closed stores): 
 
 | 2019 | | | 2018 | | 2017
Stores open at beginning of year | | 866 | | | 803 | | 750 | 
Stores opened | | 5 | | | 15 | | 16 | 
Stores acquired from franchisees/others | | 6 | | | 58 | | 44 | 
Stores closed and sold | | (100 | ) | | (10 | ) | (7 | )
Stores open at end of year | | 777 | | | 866 | | 803 | 

E-commerce 
Our websites, including PartyCity.com, offer a convenient, user-friendly and secure online shopping option for our customers. In addition to the ability to order products, our websites provide a substantial amount of content about our party products, party planning ideas and promotional offers. The websites are also one of our key marketing vehicles, specifically as they relate to social media marketing initiatives. 
 Additionally, during 2019, the Company expanded its 2018 pilot program under which it sells a selection of its products via a Party City storefront on Amazon Marketplace. 
 Retail Advertising and Marketing 
 Our advertising focuses on promoting specific seasonal occasions and general party themes, with a strong emphasis on the breadth and depth of our products and our price-value proposition, with the goal of increasing customer traffic and further building our brand. 
Competition at Retail 
 In our retail segment, our stores and e-commerce operations compete primarily on the basis of product assortment, customer convenience and value and, with regards to our stores, location and layout. Although we

 3

 compete with a variety of smaller and larger retailers, including, but not limited to, independent party goods supply stores, specialty stores, dollar stores, e-commerce merchandisers, warehouse/merchandise clubs, drug stores, and mass merchants, we believe that, based on our revenues and strong brand awareness with our customers, we maintain a leading position in the party goods business by offering a wider breadth of merchandise than most competitors and a greater selection within merchandise classes, at a compelling value. We are one of only a few vertically integrated suppliers of decorated party goods. While some of our competitors in our markets may have greater financial resources, we believe that our significant buying power, which results from the size of our retail store network and the breadth of our assortment, is an important competitive advantage. Many of our retail competitors are also customers of our wholesale business.
Retail Seasonality 
 Our retail operations are subject to significant seasonal variations. Historically, this segment has realized a significant portion of its revenues, cash flow and net income in the fourth quarter of the year, principally due to our Halloween sales in October and, to a lesser extent, year-end holiday sales. Halloween business represents approximately 20% of our total domestic retail sales. To maximize our seasonal opportunity, we operate a chain of temporary Halloween stores, under the Halloween City banner, during the months of September and October of each year.
Franchise Operations 
 We have franchised stores throughout the United States, Mexico and Puerto Rico run by franchisees utilizing our format, design specifications, methods, standards, operating procedures, systems and trademarks. Our wholesale sales to franchised stores generally mirror, with respect to relative size, mix and category, those to our company-owned stores. The following table shows the change in our franchise-owned store network over the past three years: 

 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
Stores open at beginning of year | | 96 | | 148 | | 184 | 
Stores opened/acquired by existing franchisees | | 2 | | 1 | | 3 | 
Stores sold to the Company | | — | | (50 | ) | (36 | )
Stores closed or converted to independent stores | | — | | (3 | ) | (3 | )
Stores open at end of year | | 98 | | 96 | | 148 | 

 
We are not currently marketing, nor do we plan to market, new franchise territories in the United States. During 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Grupo Oprimax to franchise the Party City concept throughout Mexico. Under the terms of the agreement, Grupo Oprimax has the opportunity to exclusively open and operate Party City stores in Mexico based on satisfaction of certain conditions. 
 We receive revenue from our franchisees, consisting of an initial one-time fee and ongoing royalty fees generally ranging from 4% to 6% of net sales. In exchange for these franchise fees, franchisees principally receive brand value and company support with respect to planograms. Each franchisee has a mandated advertising budget, which consists of a minimum initial store opening promotion and ongoing local advertising and promotions. Additionally, franchisees must pay 1% to 2.25% of net sales to a group advertising fund to cover common advertising materials. Our franchise agreements provide us with a right of first refusal should any franchisee look to dispose of its operations.
 Current franchise agreements provide for an assigned area or territory that typically equals a three or four-mile radius from the franchisee’s store location and the right to use the Party City® logo and trademark. In addition, certain agreements with our franchisees and other business partners contain geographic limitations on opening new stores. For most stores, the franchisee or the majority owner of a corporate franchisee devotes full time to the management, operation and on-premises supervision of the stores or groups of stores.

 Wholesale Operations 
 Overview 
 We currently offer over 400 party goods ensembles, which range from approximately five to 50 design-coordinated items spanning tableware, accessories, novelties, balloons and decorations. The breadth of these ensembles enables retailers to promote additional sales of related products for every occasion. To enhance our customers’ celebrations of life’s important events, we market party goods ensembles for a wide variety of occasions, including seasonal and religious holidays, special events and themed celebrations.

Wholesale Manufactured Products 
 We manufacture items representing approximately 42% of our net sales at wholesale (including sales to our retail operations). Generally, our manufacturing facilities are highly automated and produce paper and plastic plates and cups, paper napkins, metallic and latex balloons, injection molded product, costumes, pinatas and other party and novelty items at globally competitive costs. State-of-the-art printing, forming, folding and packaging equipment support most of these manufacturing operations. Given our size and sales volume, we are generally able to operate our manufacturing equipment on the basis of at least two shifts per day, thus lowering production costs per unit. In select cases, we use available capacity to manufacture products for third parties, which allows us to maintain a satisfactory level of equipment utilization.
 The table below summarizes our principal manufacturing facilities: 
 
Location | Principal Products | | Approximate Square Feet
Monterrey, Mexico | | Stickers, gift wrap, bags and invites | | 355,500 
Newburgh, New York | | Paper napkins and paper cups | | 248,000 
East Providence, Rhode Island | | Plastic plates, cups and bowls | | 229,230(1)
Louisville, Kentucky | | Paper plates | | 213,958 
Tijuana, Mexico | | Piñatas and other party products | | 135,000 
Eden Prairie, Minnesota | | Metallic balloons and accessories | | 115,600 
Melaka, Malaysia | | Latex balloons | | 100,000 
Los Lunas, New Mexico | | Injection molded plastics | | 85,055 
Antananarivo, Madagascar | | Costumes | | 41,000

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Complementing our manufacturing facilities, we have a diverse global network of third-party suppliers that supports our strategy of consistently offering a broad selection of high quality, innovative and competitively priced product. We have relationships that exceed twenty years with many of our vendors and often represent a significant portion of their overall business. They generally produce items designed by and created for us, are located in Asia, and are managed by our sourcing office in Hong Kong. We actively work with our third-party suppliers to ensure product cost, quality and safety. 

 6

 The principal raw materials used in manufacturing our products are paper, petroleum-based resin and cotton. While we currently purchase such raw material from a relatively small number of sources, paper, resin and cotton are available from numerous sources. Therefore, we believe our current suppliers could be replaced without adversely affecting our manufacturing operations in any material respect. 
 Wholesale Product Safety and Quality Assurance 
 We are subject to regulatory requirements in the United States and internationally, and we believe that all products that we manufacture and source comply with the requirements in the markets in which they are sold. Third-party manufactured products are tested both at the manufacturing site and upon arrival at our distribution centers. We have a full-time staff of professionals in the United States, Asia and Europe dedicated to product safety and quality assurance. 
Wholesale Distribution and Systems 
 We ship our products directly to retailers and distributors throughout the world from our distribution facilities, as well as directly from our domestic and international factories. Our electronic order entry and information systems allow us to manage our inventory with minimal obsolescence while maintaining strong fill rates and quick order turnaround time. 
 Our main distribution facility for domestic party customers is located in Chester, New York, with nearly 900,000 square feet under one roof. This state-of-the-art facility serves as the main point of distribution for our Amscan-branded products and utilizes a paperless, pick-by-light system, a Goods-To-Person (OSR) picking system, offering superior inventory management and turnaround times as short as 48 hours.
 We also utilize a bypass system which allows us to ship products directly from selected third-party suppliers to our company-owned and franchised stores, thus bypassing our distribution facilities. In addition to lowering our distribution costs, this bypass system enhances our warehouse capacity. 
 The distribution center for our main retail e-commerce platform is located in Naperville, Illinois. We also have other distribution centers in the U.K., Germany and Mexico in order to support our international customers.
 Wholesale Customers 
 We have a diverse third-party customer base at wholesale. During 2019, no individual third-party customer accounted for more than 10% of our total third-party sales at wholesale. 
 Competition at Wholesale 
 In our wholesale segment, we compete primarily on the basis of diversity and quality of our product designs, breadth of product line, product availability, price, reputation and customer service. Although we have many competitors with respect to one or more of our products, we believe that there are no competitors who design, manufacture, source and distribute products with the complexity of design and breadth of product lines that we do. Furthermore, our design and manufacturing processes create efficiencies in manufacturing that few of our competitors can achieve in the production of numerous coordinated products in multiple design types. Competitors include smaller independent manufacturers and distributors, as well as divisions or subsidiaries of large companies. Certain of these competitors control various party goods product licenses for widely recognized images, such as cartoon or motion picture characters, which could provide them with a competitive advantage. However, we control a strong portfolio of character licenses for use in the design and production of our metallic balloons and we have access to a strong portfolio of character and other licenses for party goods.

 Information Systems 
 We continually evaluate and upgrade our information systems to enhance the quantity, quality and timeliness of information available to management and to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing and distribution facilities, as well as our service at the store level. We have implemented merchandise replenishment software to complement our distribution, planning and allocation processes. The system enhances the store replenishment function by improving in-stock positions, leveraging our distribution infrastructure and allowing us to become more effective in our use of store labor. We have implemented a Point of Sale system and upgraded merchandising systems to standardize technology across all of our domestic retail temporary and permanent superstores.
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately 10,400 full-time employees and 7,900 part-time employees, none of whom is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
Intellectual Property 
 We own the copyrights in the designs we create and use on our products and various trademarks and service marks used on or in connection with our products. It is our practice to register our copyrights with the United States Copyright Office and our trademarks and service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or with other foreign jurisdictions, to the extent we deem necessary. In addition, we rely on unregistered common law trademark rights and unregistered copyrights under applicable U.S. law to distinguish and/or protect our products, services and branding. We do not believe that the loss of copyrights or trademarks with respect to any particular product or products would have a material adverse effect on our business. We hold numerous intellectual property licenses from third parties, allowing us to use various third-party cartoon and other characters and designs on our products, and the images on our metallic balloons and costumes are principally covered by these licenses. None of these licenses is individually material to our aggregate business. We also own patents relating to display racks and balloon weights, none of which are individually material to our aggregate business. 
 We permit our franchisees to use a number of our trademarks and service marks, including Party City, The Discount Party Super Store, Party America, Oh, It’s On, Nobody has More Party for Less and Halloween City. 
 Government Regulation 
 As a franchisor, we must comply with regulations adopted by the Federal Trade Commission, such as the Trade Regulation Rule on Franchising, which requires us, among other things, to furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise offering circular. We also must comply with a number of state laws that regulate the offer and sale of our franchises and certain substantive aspects of franchisor-franchisee relationships. These laws vary in their application and in their regulatory requirements. State laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises typically require us to, among other things, register before the offer and sale of a franchise can be made in that state and to provide a franchise offering circular to prospective franchisees. 
 State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states. Those laws regulate the franchise relationship, for example, by restricting a franchisor’s rights with regard to the termination, transfer and renewal of a franchise agreement (for example, by requiring “good cause” to exist as a basis for the termination and the franchisor’s decision to refuse to permit the franchisee to exercise its transfer or renewal rights), by requiring the franchisor to give advance notice to the franchisee of the termination and give the franchisee an opportunity to cure most defaults. To date, those laws have not precluded us from seeking franchisees in any given area and have not had a material adverse effect on our operations. 

 8

 Our wholesale and retail segments must also comply with applicable regulations adopted by federal agencies, including product safety regulations, and with licensing and other regulations enforced by state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire and other departments. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals can delay and sometimes prevent the opening of a new store or the shutting down of an existing store. 
 Our manufacturing operations, stores and other facilities must comply with applicable environmental, health and safety regulations, although the cost of complying with these regulations to date has not been material. More stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use, and environmental factors can delay, and sometimes prevent, development of new stores in particular locations. Our stores must comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act and various state laws governing various matters such as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions. Our stores must also comply with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires that employers provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities and that stores must be accessible to customers with disabilities.
