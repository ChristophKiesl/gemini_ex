Overview
 
Our primary product is the Blockchain Archive Server—a turn-key, off-the-shelf, blockchain solution that works with virtually any hardware and software combinations currently used in commerce, without the need to replace or eliminate any part of the client’s data security that is being utilized. The Blockchain Archive Server encrypts, fragments, and distributes data across thousands of secure nodes every day, which makes it virtually impossible for hackers to compromise. Using blockchain technology, the Blockchain Archive Server maintains a redundant, secure, and immutable backup of data. Redundant backups and the blockchain work together to assure not only the physical security of the database but also the integrity of the information held within.
 
Blockchain Archive Server protects client data from “ransomware”—malicious software that infects your computer and displays messages demanding a fee to be paid in order for your system to work again. Blockchain technology is a leading-edge tool for data security, providing an added layer of security against data loss due to all types of software specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system (i.e., malware).
 
Uniquely, the Blockchain Archive Server is a turn-key solution that can stand alone or seamlessly integrate into an existing data infrastructure to quickly recover from a cyber-attack. The Blockchain Archive Server is a server that comes pre-loaded with the blockchain-powered cybersecurity software, which can be delivered, installed, and integrated into a client’s computer systems with ease.
 
In December 2020, Sollensys made its second product offering—the Regional Service Center—available on a limited test market basis. The Regional Service Center was added to the Company’s standard product line effective January 1, 2021. A Regional Service Center is a single unit system of 32 Blockchain Archive Servers capable of servicing up to 2,580 individual small accounts, and is marketed to existing IT service providers with established accounts. The Regional Service Center offers small businesses the same state of the art technology previously available only to large or very well-funded companies. Sollensys believes that smaller companies, and even certain individuals, will find the Regional Service Center affordable, paying only for the actual space they use.
 
In connection with the closing of the Stock Purchase, on August 5, 2020, Mr. Lazar, the then-sole member of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Sollensys, pursuant to the power granted to the Board in Sollensys’ bylaws, increased the size of Sollensys’ Board to two members. Simultaneously, Mr. Lazar, as the sole Board member, appointed Donald Beavers as a director to fill the newly created Board vacancy. At the same time, Mr. Lazar appointed Donald Beavers as Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of Sollensys.
 
Also on August 5, 2020, following the above officer and director appointments and effective on the closing of the Stock Purchase, Mr. Lazar resigned from any and all officer and director positions with Sollensys.
 
On November 30, 2020, Sollensys entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with (i) Eagle Lake, (ii) each of the shareholders of Eagle Lake (the “Eagle Lake Shareholders”) and (iii) Mr. Beavers as the representative of the Eagle Lake Shareholders. Among other conditions to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement (the “SEA Closing”), pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the parties agreed that Sollensys would acquire 100% of Eagle Lake’s issued and outstanding capital stock, in exchange for the issuance to the Eagle Lake Shareholders of a number of shares of Sollensys common stock to be determined at the SEA Closing.
 
The SEA Closing occurred on November 30, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, Sollensys acquired from the Eagle Lake Shareholders 10,000,000 shares Eagle Lake’s common stock, no par value per share, representing 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Eagle Lake, in exchange for the issuance to the Eagle Lake Shareholders of 95,000,000 shares of Sollensys common stock (the “Share Exchange”). At the time of the SEA Closing, Eagle Lake had 10,011,667 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding, which was 11,667 shares in excess of the number of shares of common stock authorized pursuant to Eagle Lake’s articles of incorporation. Such over-issued shares are void under Florida law and are not entitled to any rights of a stockholder of Eagle Lake. As such, the 10,000,000 shares of Eagle Lake common stock that Sollensys acquired from the Eagle Lake Shareholders, represented 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Eagle Lake of the presence of over-issued shares.

As a result of the Share Exchange, Eagle Lake became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sollensys and the business of Eagle Lake became the business of Sollensys.
 
Eagle Lake was incorporated in the State of Florida on May 8, 2020. Eagle Lake offers advanced technology products for cybersecurity that ensure a clients’ data integrity through collection, storage, and transmission.
 
On September 8, 2021, the Company closed on the purchase of a commercial building, land, and fixtures in Palm Bay, Florida, as a location for the Company’s new headquarters.
 
On October 15, 2021, the Company entered into that certain Membership Interest Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”), dated as of October 15, 2021, by and among (i) the Company; (ii) Abstract Media, LLC (“Abstract Media”), (iii) each of the members of Abstract Media (collectively, the “Abstract Media Members”); and (iv) Andrew Baker as the representative of the Abstract Media Members (the “Members’ Representative”).
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire from the Abstract Media Members all of the membership interests of Abstract Media held by the Abstract Media Members, representing 100% of the membership interests of Abstract Media, in exchange for the issuance by the Company to the Abstract Media Members of (i) shares of the Company’s common stock equal to $605,000 based on the trading price of the Company’s common stock minus the Debt Repayment Amount (as hereinafter defined), divided by the VWAP (as defined in the Agreement) as of the closing date, plus (ii) $15,000, plus (iii) $15,000 to be paid solely to John Swain as additional consideration for Mr. Swain’s membership interests (the “Acquisition”). The “Debt Repayment Amount” means the debt owned by the Company to Mr. Swain pursuant to a promissory note dated as of August 15, 2017, which debt the parties agree is approximately $80,000, but which shall be finally calculated on the closing date.
 
The Acquisition closed on December 6, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, on December 6, 2021, the Abstract Media Members assigned their respective membership interests in Abstract Media to the Company, and Abstract Media became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In exchange therefor, on December 6, 2021, the Company issued to the Abstract Media Members an aggregate of 73,244 shares of the Company’s common stock, plus (ii) $15,000 paid to members, plus (iii) $15,000 paid solely to John Swain as additional consideration for Mr. Swain’s membership interests.
 
Impact of COVID-19
 
On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization announced a global health emergency because of the spread of a new strain of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. COVID-19 has significantly affected, and continues to significantly affect, the United States and global economies.
 
The outbreak has, and may continue to, spread, which could materially impact the Company’s business. The full extent of potential impacts on the Company’s business, financing activities and the global economy will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted due to the uncertain nature of the continued COVID-19 pandemic, government mandated shutdowns, and its adverse effects, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. These effects could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
Future Product and Service Offerings
 
In the future, we may decide to expand our product and service offerings outside of blockchain cybersecurity solutions, and develop science, technology, and engineering solutions for companies in fields such as aerospace, chemical engineering, defense and intelligence, but as of December 31, 2021, we focus exclusively on blockchain technology solutions for cybersecurity and data management. We focus on innovation and development of commercial blockchain applications that are either complementary to the Blockchain Archive Server or standalone products and services related to cybersecurity.
 
We are in the process of developing a new blockchain cybersecurity application—the “Argus Panoptes RFID System”—and is preparing to file related patent applications for the product. The Argus Panoptes RFID System is a developmental stage product that allows the Blockchain Archive Server to record data from radio-frequency identification (RFID) sensors. As of December 31, 2021, the Argus Panoptes RFID System is still under development, but we expect to launch within 12 months from the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are preparing potential patents to be filed for the technology underlying the Argus Panoptes RFID System, which we believe to be unique.

Distribution
 
Sales Structure
 
The Blockchain Archive Server is now available across the United States and Canada through authorized distributors. Currently, Sollensys Corp is the only authorized distributor of the Blockchain Archive Server, pursuant to a Reseller Agreement between Eagle Lake and Sollensys entered into on August 20, 2020 (the “Reseller Agreement”).
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Reseller Agreement, Eagle Lake appointed Sollensys as a non-exclusive distributor of Eagle Lake’s products and services. As a distributor for Eagle Lake, Sollensys has agreed to, among other things, use its best efforts to solicit orders from interested parties for Eagle Lake’s products and services, secure channel partners and distributors for Eagle Lake’s products and services, and to resell Eagle Lake’s products and services to for-profit organizations, non-profit-organizations, government entities, quasi-governmental agencies, and any other type of organizations in the United States and abroad. Sollensys also has the right to engage its own distributors for Eagle Lake’s products. For all sales, Sollensys is entitled to any profits generated on such sales, which is the difference between the cost of Sollensys to acquire the products and/or services from Eagle Lake to sell and the price at which Sollensys is ultimately able to sell those products and/or services to customers.
 
Delivery & Installation
 
The Blockchain Archive Server is a turn-key solution that can stand alone or seamlessly integrate into an existing data infrastructure to quickly recover from a cyber-attack. Delivery of the Blockchain Archive Server to a client is accomplished by delivering a server loaded with Eagle Lake’s blockchain cybersecurity software (i.e., the Blockchain Archive Server) to a client’s physical location where such client’s information technology (“IT”) systems infrastructure is accessible. Once physically delivered on-site, the Blockchain Archive Server is installed and integrated with the client’s existing IT system servers. The unit remains at the client’s location to run the software. Sollensys (or its authorized distributors) handles all delivery and installation of the Blockchain Server, and provides maintenance as needed.
Industry Overview and Market Opportunity
 
Cyberattacks have evolved from rudimentary malware into highly sophisticated, organized, and large-scale attacks. A broad range of industries are affected by these attacks, consumers to governments, no one is safe.
 
According to a 2019 Year End Report published by RiskBased Security, over 7,000 data breaches were reported in 2019 alone, resulting in over 15 billion records being exposed that show companies have an expanding need to protect themselves from persistent cyber-attacks.
 
Ransomware attacks have generated billions of dollars in payments to cybercriminals and inflicted significant damage and expenses for consumers, businesses, and governments. Sophos publish a report in May 2020 titled “The State of Ransomware 2020”. This showed 59% of 500 U.S. organizations surveyed, experienced a ransomware attack, with a global average of 51% of companies having been victims of ransomware attacks in the last year. This report also stated that the average cost to rectify the impacts of a ransomware attack (considering downtime, human resources, device cost, network cost, ransom price, etc.) was $732,520 for organizations that do not pay the ransom. The price tag for organizations that do pay rises to $1,448,458. As of October 1, 2021, the U.S. Department of Treasure warns that paying a ransom my violate U.S. law.
 
An October 2020 article published by Security Magazine reported that data from 25,000 small-to-midsize organizations in the United States reveal ransomware as the top cyber insurance incident in the first half of the year. The average ransomware demand increased 100% from 2019 through the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, 10% of small businesses were put out of business in 2019 due to cyber-attacks according to DarkReading.com.
 
These trends provide significant data demonstrating the need for Sollensys’ Blockchain Archive Server in the cybersecurity market. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), the “addressable enterprise security market” benefiting from Sollensys solutions is expected to reach nearly $17.3 billion in 2020, growing at a CAGR of 6.9% through 2024. The “addressable enterprise security market” represents revenue from five markets (web security, security information and event management, network security, corporate endpoint, and data loss protection).

Competition
 
The market for cybersecurity solutions for organizations (i.e., enterprises, governments, etc.) is highly competitive and constantly evolving. Conditions in our market are prone to frequent and rapid changes in technology, customer requirements and preferences, and industry standards resulting in frequent new product and service offerings and improvements and the entrance of new market participants. As a result, we face a broad set of competitors.
 
We compete for cybersecurity budgets both with larger integration providers, such as Symantec (a division of Broadcom), Palo Alto Networks, Sophos, Microsoft, Trend Micro, and Sentinel One in the endpoint, networking, and cloud access security broker (“CASB”) space, as well as with point solutions focusing on a subset of the cybersecurity market. These competitors include Crowdstrike, Carbon Black (a division of VMware), Tanium, and Cylance (a division of BlackBerry) in the endpoint market, Netskope, and Bitglass in the CASB market, IBM and Cisco in network intrusion, Forcepoint, and Zscaler in the secure web gateways market, and IBM, Splunk, Micro Focus, Dell, and LogRhythm in the security operations market. Products and services differ depending on the organization, but are all considered part of the end user’s cybersecurity budget.
 
The principal competitive factors in the markets for our solutions include:
 

● | brand recognition and reputation;
--+----------------------------------


● | breadth and integration of product offerings;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | product features, reliability, performance, and effectiveness;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | price and total cost of ownership;
--+-----------------------------------


● | strength and productivity of sales and marketing efforts;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | quality of customer service; and
--+---------------------------------


● | financial resources and stability.
--+-----------------------------------

 
We are not aware of any direct competitors with a product solution similar to the Blockchain Archive Server. Nonetheless, we face competition for budget allocations in all of the areas outlined above. We believe we compete favorably in a number of the above factors; however, we believe that our primary competitive advantage is the compatibility and ease of installation of our Blockchain Archive Server, which was designed as a turn-key solution that can stand alone or seamlessly integrate into an existing data infrastructure to quickly recover from a cyber-attack.
 
However, many of our current competitors and potential competitors have competitive advantages, such as more extensive operations, larger product development and strategic acquisition budgets, or greater financial, technical, sales, or marketing resources than we do. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Customers, Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our products or services directly to customers. In addition, in the future, we may contract with third party distributors on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis to sell our products and services.
 
We have sold the Blockchain Archive Server to a number of different companies in a wide array of industries. Companies that have purchased the Blockchain Archive Server include SFTF, LLC, which operates five Ashley HomeStore Outlets in Jacksonville, Florida. Ashley HomeStore is the number one furniture and mattress retailer in America and the number one selling furniture store brand in the world. In addition, the Blockchain Archive Server has been purchased and installed for medical data protection at Ability Plus Therapy Inc., which operates a pediatric therapy center in Melbourne, Florida and at Island Direct Primary Care, a concierge medical service in Merritt Island, Florida. Both firms provide private health care and wellness services to individuals or companies. At these locations, a special version of the Blockchain Archive Server designed to meet the unique requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) regarding patient/doctor confidentiality was delivered to these customers.
 
The Blockchain Archive Server is available across the United States and Canada. To date, most customers have been small-to-medium sized businesses. We are dependent on any of these individual customers.

Suppliers and Raw Materials
 
We purchase the servers used to make the Blockchain Archive Servers from third-party retailers, such as Amazon. We have not entered into any agreements with suppliers for any hardware or other raw materials.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to compliance with a number of regulations, in the United States and internationally, in connection with the operation of our business. By virtue of the fact that our Blockchain Archive Server involves processing of personal information, we are subject to data protection and privacy laws and regulations, which are evolving and being tested in courts, which may result in increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions.
 
A variety of data protection legislation apply in the U.S. at both the federal and state level, including new laws that may impact our operations. For example, in 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, with enforcement by the state attorney general beginning July 1, 2020. The CCPA defines “personal information” in a broad manner and generally requires companies that process personal information of California residents to make new disclosures about their data collection, use, and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt-out of certain data sharing with third parties or sale of personal information, and provides a new cause of action for data breaches.
 
In 2016, the European Union (the “E.U.”) adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which took effect in 2018. The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements on entities that receive or process personal data (as compared to existing E.U. law), along with significant penalties for non-compliance, more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers, greater rights for data subjects (potentially requiring significant changes to both our technology and operations), and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. Similarly, there are a number of federal and state level legislative proposals in the U.S. that could impose new obligations on us. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing more onerous data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or other requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. Although our sales are currently focused on customers in the U.S. and Canada, we may expand into Europe in the future, and would then be subject to such laws.
 
Like other U.S.-based IT security products, our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, specifically the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), U.S. economic and trade sanctions regulations and applicable foreign government import, export and use requirements. Certain of our products may be subject to encryption controls under the EAR due to the nature of the product and its use or incorporation of encryption functionality. Under the encryption controls in the EAR, applicable products may only be exported outside of the U.S. with required export authorizations, such as a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. In addition to the restrictions under the EAR, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the export of products and services to countries, governments, entities or persons subject to U.S. embargoes or trade sanctions.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We filed an application for a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) on July 14, 2020 under Application Serial No. 90051101 for the Word Mark “Blockchain Archive Server”. The trademark is currently pending registration by the USPTO.
 
We are in the process of preparing multiple patent applications related to our blockchain technology. We treat our unique technology as trade secrets and all software source code is obfuscated before being distributed. On August 12, 2020, we acquired the intellectual property rights to certain technology that we intend to utilize in connection with the Argus Panoptes RFID System.

We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees and have not experienced any labor disputes.
 
Corporate History
 
Sollensys Corp was formerly a development stage company, incorporated in Nevada on September 29, 2010, under the name Health Directory, Inc. The Company’s initial plans included organization and incorporation, target market identification, marketing plans, and capital formation. A substantial portion of the Company’s efforts involved developing a business plan and establishing contacts and visibility in the marketplace. The Company did not, however, generate any revenues from these efforts.
 
Effective July 30, 2012, the holder of 3,000,000 shares, or approximately 79.8% of the Company’s then outstanding voting securities, executed a written consent approving an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the Company’s name to Sollensys Corp, to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to 1,500,000,000, increase the number of authorized preferred shares to 25,000,000, and to split each outstanding share of common stock into 131.69 shares of common stock.
 
Subsequently, beginning September 30, 2012, the Company went dormant.
 
On December 27, 2019, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County, Nevada (the “Court”), pursuant to Case number A-19-805633-B appointed Custodian Ventures, LLC (“Custodian Ventures”) as the custodian of Sollensys Corp David Lazar, who controls Custodian Ventures, was subsequently named the only interim officer and director of the Company.
 
On June 16, 2020, Custodian Ventures filed a motion with the Court asking the Court to enter an order concluding and terminating the custodianship of the Company. On July 20, 2020, the Court entered an order terminating custodianship and barring non-asserted claims against the Company.
 
Effective August 5, 2020, Mr. Lazar, the interim Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Treasurer, and sole director of the Company and the beneficial owner, through his ownership of Custodian Ventures of 19,000,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, representing 100% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) by and among Eagle Lake, Sollensys Corp, and Custodian Ventures. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, Eagle Lake agreed to purchase, and Custodian Ventures agreed to sell, 19,000,000 shares of the Company’s Series A preferred stock in exchange for payment by Eagle Lake to Custodian Ventures of $230,000 (collectively with the other transactions in the SPA, the “Stock Purchase”). The Stock Purchase closed on August 5, 2020. The shares of Series A preferred stock are convertible into shares of common stock at a rate of 50 shares of common stock per share of Series A preferred stock, and has voting power on an as-converted basis (voting with the common stock as one class), and thus represents 65.4% of the voting power of all shares of stock of the Company.

In connection with the closing of the Stock Purchase, on August 5, 2020, Mr. Lazar, the then-sole member of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company, pursuant to the power granted to the Board in the Company’s bylaws, increased the size of the Company’s Board to two members. Simultaneously, Mr. Lazar, as the sole Board member, appointed Donald Beavers as a director to fill the newly created Board vacancy. At the same time, Mr. Lazar appointed Mr. Beavers as Chief Executive Officer and Secretary of the Company.
 
Also on August 5, 2020, following Mr. Beaver’s appointment and effective on the closing of the Stock Purchase, Mr. Lazar resigned from any and all officer and director positions with the Company. Mr. Lazar’s resignation was not the result of a disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies, or practices.
 
On November 30, 2020, Sollensys Corp entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with (i) Eagle Lake, (ii) each of the shareholders of Eagle Lake (the “Eagle Lake Shareholders”) and (iii) Mr. Beavers as the representative of the Eagle Lake Shareholders (the “Shareholders’ Representative”).
 
Among other conditions to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement (the “SEA Closing”), pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the parties agreed that Sollensys Corp would acquire 100% of Eagle Lake’s issued and outstanding capital stock, in exchange for the issuance to the Eagle Lake Shareholders of a number of shares of Sollensys Corp’s common stock to be determined at the SEA Closing.
 
The SEA Closing occurred on November 30, 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, Sollensys Corp acquired from the Eagle Lake Shareholders 10,000,000 shares Eagle Lake’s common stock, no par value per share, representing 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Eagle Lake, in exchange for the issuance to the Eagle Lake Shareholders of 95,000,000 shares of Sollensys common stock (the “Share Exchange”). At the time of the SEA Closing, Eagle Lake had 10,011,667 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding, which was 11,667 shares in excess of the number of shares of common stock authorized pursuant to Eagle Lake’s articles of incorporation.
