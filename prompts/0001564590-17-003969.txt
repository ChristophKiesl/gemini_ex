 AEO Direct
 We sell merchandise through our digital channels, ae.com, aerie.com and our AEO apps, both domestically and internationally in 81 countries. The digital channels reinforce each particular brand platform, and are designed to complement the in-store experience. 
 Over the past several years, we have invested in building our technologies and digital capabilities. We focused our investments in three key areas: making significant advances in mobile technology, investing in digital marketing and improving the desktop and tablet experience.  
 5


Omni-Channel
 In addition to our investments in technology, we have invested in building omni-channel capabilities to better serve customers and gain operational efficiencies. These upgraded technologies have provided a single view of inventory across channels, connecting physical stores directly to our digital store, providing our customers with a more convenient and improved shopping experience.  Our two distribution centers are fully omni-channel and service both stores and digital businesses.  We offer the ability for customers to seamlessly return product via any channel regardless of where it was originally purchased. Our store-to-door capability enables store customers to make purchases from online inventory while shopping in our stores.  Additionally, we fulfill online orders at stores through our buy online, ship from store capability, maximizing inventory exposure to digital traffic.  We also offer a reserve online, pick up in store service to our customers and give them the ability to lookup in-store inventory from all digital channels.  We will continue to optimize these tools and services to build ongoing improvements to the customer shopping experience.
 Merchandise Suppliers
 We design our merchandise, which is manufactured by third-party factories. During Fiscal 2016, we purchased substantially all of our merchandise from non-North American suppliers. For the year, we sourced merchandise through approximately 300 vendors located throughout the world, primarily in Asia, and did not source more than 10% of our merchandise from any single factory or supplier during the year. 
 We maintain a quality control department at our distribution centers to inspect incoming merchandise shipments for overall quality of manufacturing. Inspections are also made by our employees and agents at manufacturing facilities to identify quality issues prior to shipment of merchandise.
 We uphold an extensive factory inspection program to monitor compliance with our Vendor Code of Conduct.  New garment factories must pass an initial inspection in order to do business with us and we continue to review their social compliance performance both through internal audits by our compliance team and through the use of third-party monitors.  We strive to partner with suppliers who respect local laws and share our dedication to utilize best practices in human rights, labor rights, environmental practices and workplace safety.  We have been a certified member of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program (“C-TPAT”) since 2004.  C-TPAT is a voluntary program offered by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) in which an importer agrees to work with CBP to strengthen overall supply chain security.  As of September 2016, we were accepted into the Apparel, Footwear and Textiles Center, one of CBP’s Centers of Excellence and Expertise (“CEE”).  The CEE was created to ensure uniformity, create efficiencies, reduce redundancies, enhance industry expertise and facilitate trade, all with a final goal of reduced costs at the border and allowing CBP to focus on high-risk shipments.
 Inventory and Distribution
 Merchandise is shipped directly from our vendors to our U.S. distribution centers in Hazleton, Pennsylvania and Ottawa, Kansas, or to our Canadian distribution center in Mississauga, Ontario.  Additionally, an increasing amount of product is shipped directly to stores which reduces transit times and lowers operating costs. We contract with third-party distribution centers in Mexico, Hong Kong, China and the Netherlands to service our Company owned stores in those regions. 
Regulation
 We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by foreign suppliers and imported by us, and we are subject to a variety of trade laws, customs regulations and international trade agreements.  Apparel and other products sold by us are under the jurisdiction of multiple governmental agencies and regulations, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, marketing, licensing requirements, and consumer product safety requirements and regulatory testing.  We are also subject to regulations governing our employees both globally and in the U.S., and by disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly traded companies established under existing or new federal or state laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”).
 Our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our products are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, vendors, and factories to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we

are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.
 Competition
 The global retail apparel industry is highly competitive both in stores and online. We compete with various local, national, and global apparel retailers, as well as the casual apparel and footwear departments of department stores and discount retailers, primarily on the basis of quality, fashion, service, selection and price.
Trademarks and Service Marks
 We have registered AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS®, AMERICAN EAGLE®, AE®, AEO®, #WeAllCanTM, LIVE YOUR LIFE®, Aerie® and the Flying Eagle Design with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We also have registered or have applied to register substantially all of these trademarks with the registries of the foreign countries in which our stores and/or manufacturers are located and/or where our product is shipped. 
 We have registered AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS®, AMERICAN EAGLE®, AEO®, LIVE YOUR LIFE®, Aerie® and the Flying Eagle Design with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. In addition, we have acquired rights in AETM for clothing products and registered AE® in connection with certain non-clothing products. 
 In the U.S. and in other countries around the world, we also have registered, or have applied to register, a number of other marks used in our business, including our pocket stitch designs.
 Our registered trademarks are renewable indefinitely, and their registrations are properly maintained in accordance with the laws of the country in which they are registered.  We believe that the recognition associated with these trademarks makes them extremely valuable and, therefore, we intend to use and renew our trademarks in accordance with our business plans.
 Employees
 As of January 28, 2017, we had approximately 38,700 employees in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Hong Kong, China and the United Kingdom of whom approximately 32,100 were part-time or seasonal hourly employees.
