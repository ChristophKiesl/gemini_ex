ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our mission
Our mission is to improve health for all with great, innovative, affordable medicines so that people with life-changing or chronic conditions can gain access to the medicines they need, physicians can treat patients without barriers to prescribing, and health systems can afford to make those medicines available, without restrictions, to the populations they serve in a financially sustainable manner.
The EQRx business opportunity
Thanks to the powerful tools and technologies of the 21st century, including genome sequencing, proteomics, and genomics, to name a few, society has made tremendous progress in elucidating the drivers of many, but not all, diseases at the molecular mechanism level. It is now possible to engineer innovative molecules around well-known targets, as evidenced by the expanding supply of innovative but overlapping drug candidates with their own intellectual property. For example, there are now 60 Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) programs and over 160 checkpoint inhibitors in various stages of development. With the proliferation of cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI), machine-learning and technology enabled experimental drug discovery engineering platforms, this trend is expected to further accelerate, leading to more rapid engineering of potential molecules against disease targets, reducing expensive failure rates and lowering costs of early development.
Yet, unlike other industries where prices fall with technology advances and spur competition, prices for innovative medicines have continued to increase. In 1990, prescription drug expenditure in the United States totalled $40 billion. This expenditure has since increased to over $350 billion in 2020, an almost 9-fold increase, or a 7.5% year-on-year increase over the past 30 years. Global prescription drug spend has increased over 200% from 2000 through 2020 and over 1,500% from 1989 through 2020, with global drug spend in 2021 estimated to be approximately $1 trillion.
Our catalog of more than 10 programs today is estimated to address more than $100 billion of global specialty drug spend by 2026. There is no guarantee that we will identify suitable assets to grow our addressable market and even if we do, we may not be able to acquire these assets or develop them successfully to achieve our targets. Further, our preclinical and early-stage discovery programs may not ever result in clinical development candidates.
As the average annual cost for new cancer therapies continues to increase, many patients struggle with the physical and emotional effects of high out-of-pocket medical costs. The clinical consequences are significant, either because of lack of access to the best therapy for a patient’s disease or due to worse outcomes. For instance, a number of recent studies have shown that there is a statistically significant correlation between out-of-pocket costs and increased mortality for lung cancer patients.
In some countries, rising drug prices have led to significant second-order challenges beyond the financial burden. When compared to the United States, innovative drugs in developed ex-U.S. markets often have price tags that exceed cost-effectiveness thresholds, resulting in launch delays for safe and efficacious drugs or reduced access.
At the same time, there are opportunities to making the drug development process significantly more efficient, as has been shown during the COVID-19 pandemic; the use of master protocols, decentralized trials including leveraging novel technology and data tools for data collection, remote and mobile monitoring, to name just a few of the levers that not only lower cost and increase speed but also have a positive effect on the patient experience.



This creates the opportunity for EQRx. The potential to leverage recent scientific, technological, and medical advances to develop innovative medicines at significantly lower costs and greater speed. The potential to capture a significant share of a large and growing market by offering future innovative therapies at lower prices. At scale, this creates a massive business opportunity that heretofore, no company has attempted to pursue and that we believe we are purpose-built to capture.
​
​



Time for something new — time for “New Pharma”
Our business model – “New Pharma”
So, it’s time for something new. Time for a new business model to leverage these scientific, technological, and medical advances together with a new commercial model; one based on trust and collaboration with payers and health systems, rather than one focused on adversarial negotiations. Time to focus on efficiency from inception, to create the required cost structure to sustain dramatically lower prices. Time for a model built to successfully develop and commercialize medicines at scale. It’s time for “New Pharma.”
Our “New Pharma” solution starts with assembling a catalog of medicines at significant scale, targeting some of the most innovative clinical opportunities and highest drug cost categories of today and tomorrow, with an initial focus on oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases. We are focused on developing programs that are innovative, branded, and patent-protected that, if approved, have the potential to be equivalent or superior to other therapies in their class. However, there is no guarantee our product candidates will be approved, or if approved will be equivalent or superior to such other therapies.
Through our team of leading drug hunters, we are building our catalog through:

● | In-licensing clinical and preclinical stage programs to accelerate our business model
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Building alliances with cutting-edge drug engineering platforms to build an earlier-stage pipeline of programs
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Establishing partnerships with other biopharma companies to develop combination therapies
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for our medicines, we plan to offer our catalog of innovative medicines to payers and health systems at radically lower prices, through a simple and transparent pricing model without surprise price increases. However, we do not currently have, and may never have, any products approved for commercial sale, and our business and pricing model is untested and may never be successful.
We are also assembling a Global Buyers Club by entering into long-term, trusted strategic partnerships with private and public payers, providers and health systems so they and the patients they serve can gain access to, if approved, our future medicines at radically lower prices. We will offer simple and transparent pricing models to provide an opportunity for dramatic savings in these high-cost drug areas, while also providing broader access to important medicines for their patients in a sustainable matter. As part of this “New Deal” working collaboratively with our strategic partners, we ask that they make prescribing seamless for physicians, lower cost share for patients, and reduce utilization barriers that slow access to important medicines. We are effectively replacing the traditional “push” model with a “pull” model to drive adoption of our medicines.
​



As a result, patients and physicians will have better options for important medicines, payers will receive greater value and we create true access and a greater customer experience for patients.
We believe that healthcare innovation must include new ways of making life-changing therapies affordable and accessible to every patient who needs them through a market-based solution. Failing to do so could possibly result in drug pricing being addressed by regulation or legislation that could result in repercussions to innovation and competition.
​
We do not currently have, and may never have, any products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue to date, and so may never become profitable. In addition, our business and pricing model is untested and may never be successful or generate sufficient revenue to lead to profitability. Please see the section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Warrants.”
​



Designing a highly efficient model
The key to building a profitable business while offering radically lower prices is a lower cost structure, building the business at scale with a relentless focus on efficiency. There are several sources of efficiencies resulting in a significantly lower unit cost for our future medicines, driven both by significantly lower research and development as well as commercial expenses:

● | Higher expected success rate: With a focus on validated targets, where we understand the mechanism of action and the underlying biology, we expect to create greater probability of success compared to the typical biopharma model. Our business model also contemplates that we will not need to burden the prices of our future therapies to compensate for the costs of prior drug failures. Whereas historical industry success rates have typically been between 10% to 20%, we are anticipating higher success rates for our clinical candidates due to our focus on validated targets. However, the drug development process is inherently uncertain and cannot be fully de-risked, and there can be no guarantee that our approach to drug development will achieve these success rates, or that we will be able to avoid the cost burdens as anticipated.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Efficient drug development: With an eye towards lowering drug development costs, we are building a truly modern drug development organization. This includes incorporating the many ways in which incremental operational improvements can be incorporated into the end-to-end drug development process to run clinical trials better, faster, and at lower costs. We believe modern development processes that are data-science enabled will allow us to operate more seamlessly and more directly, creating less dependency on external service providers and a more direct control of the data we are generating. Our predictive screening and overall development approach have not yet been clinically validated, our chosen drug candidates may not function as anticipated in future clinical trials, and there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in creating a new and modern approach to drug development. Additionally, our model emphasizes the generation of a comprehensive body of clinical data to support the adoption of our future medicines, if approved, recognizing that trials intended solely for the purpose of regulatory approval often do not address issues important to prescribing decisions. These issues include establishing efficacy and safety in patient populations more typical of “real-world” practice, specific tolerability or safety questions, treatment adherence, optimization of dose and schedule, and associated medical resource utilization. While recognizing the need to secure appropriate approved indications, we expect that many of the trials we conduct to generate evidence to support adoption will be designed and executed in conjunction with prescribing physicians and associated payers, so that specific questions of relevance to the use of these medicines in established therapeutic classes can be addressed. We expect the result of our approach will be clinical evidence programs that strike a balance between studies conducted for regulatory use and those intended for physician and payer audiences, rather than programs that are heavily weighted towards traditional registrational clinical trials. However, our model is untested and there is no guarantee that clinical trials we conduct in the future will provide us with positive or actionable data that will facilitate efficient clinical development or that we will be able to address the relevance to the use of these medicines in established therapeutic classes as anticipated.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Streamlined commercial model: In a traditional biopharma company, a significant proportion of operating costs are spent on large sales forces and marketing budgets, effectively “pushing” high-cost medicines to physicians and directly to consumers. We will not be building a traditional sales and marketing oriented commercial organization; rather, we expect that our ability to create greater pull-through of our future medicines by our strategic partners will enable us to significantly reduce commercial costs, effectively replacing the traditional “push” model with a “pull” model. Our model is untested, and there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in our attempt to replace the traditional sales organization with our “pull” model.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Economics that enable “New Pharma”
If we are successful in executing our business model, each element in this equation would contribute to reducing the unit cost of bringing innovative drugs to patients at dramatically lower prices, while still maintaining reasonable margins. As illustrated in the figure below, these elements, taken together and replicated across a scaled catalog of medicines, have the potential to improve access to developing novel, high quality, patent protected medicines while simultaneously reducing systemic spend on healthcare and building an efficient, sustainable and profitable business.
​
​



Our flywheel
As we add therapeutic options to our catalog of medicines, we are able to create greater value for our strategic partners; and as we are adding partners to our Global Buyers Club, we expect to generate more opportunities to grow our catalog of medicines. This in turn means we will be able to create more and more true access for people around the world who will be able to benefit from innovative science for their chronic or life-threatening condition. This marketplace becomes more efficient over time, including adding more therapies to the catalog as other drug developers partner with us to leverage the relationships and connections with the Global Buyers Club already built. Over time, this creates a fly wheel, making our model sustainable and creating a significant competitive advantage. The result is a sustainable engine of innovative medicines at dramatically lower prices.
​



Business model innovation in other industries
In the 1970s, Southwest Airlines (Southwest) disrupted the market with a single interstate route and now carries more air travelers flying nonstop within the United States than any other airline. One of the founding principles of the Southwest business model was offering radically lower fares to ensure air travel no longer discriminated across socioeconomic classes. To accomplish profitability with these fares, the company would also need to sustain a radically lower cost structure, which it achieved by moving to a single type of airplane, changing the traditional hub-and-spoke network approach to point-to-point, changing turnaround time, and simplifying fares.
Today, Southwest is one of the most honored airlines in the world, known for a “triple bottom line approach” that contributes to (i) the carrier’s performance and productivity, (ii) the importance of its people and the communities they serve, and (iii) an overall commitment to efficiency and the planet. The success of this business model is demonstrated by over 40 consecutive years of profitability, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the only U.S. airline that can make that claim.
We believe there are parallels between Southwest’s business model and ours. We aim to remake a large, incumbent industry, democratizing access to innovative medicines through lowering prices and increasing access and transparency. We aim to operate profitably while also caring for our patients, our people, our partners, and the healthcare system ecosystem.
In another more recent example, Netflix has disrupted the media and entertainment industry, and we believe there are some parallels across our business models. Netflix initially introduced a low-cost offering with known high-quality content, conveniently delivered against the existing cable carriers. Traditional cable networks forced viewers to overpay as cable carriers would strategically package content to force customers to purchase bigger and more comprehensive cable packages in order to gain access to the content they wanted. Simply put, customers were being overcharged for what they wanted to subsidize the content that yielded lower demand. Netflix initially delivered content generated by other producers in a more transparent, simple, convenient format. Eventually, Netflix became a content creator and marketplace for its own and others’ content, maintaining a low, simple to understand subscription-based pricing model delivering content conveniently and at scale. Netflix democratized viewable content.
Our intent is to create a marketplace with a low, transparent pricing model expanding access to innovative medicines for everyone.
Our business and pricing model is untested in the pharmaceutical industry, and there can be no assurance that our business model will achieve market acceptance or be able to compete effectively in the pharmaceutical industry or generate sufficient revenue to lead to profitability.

​
​



Our people and culture
As of December 31, 2021, we employ over 240 ‘changemakers’ who are committed to advancing our mission and contributing to our strong culture. We have a tremendous focus on execution, “GSD” or “Getting Stuff Done”, and we celebrate “Be you at EQ,” which encourages bold and creative thinking, transparency, trust, and collaboration in everything we do. Further, we have won over 30 industry awards to date, including awards for Best Company Culture and Best Company Leadership team, and we have been recognized for our commitment to diversity with our majority female workforce. We are tremendously proud of the recognition we have received for our people and culture.
Our Board of Directors
Our Board of Directors includes industry leaders and veterans, company builders and investors across life sciences, technology/data, and healthcare. They have been invested in our mission since our inception, and we are grateful for their ongoing guidance and support.
Our investors
We are supported by a top-tier investor base that includes leading life science specialists, world-class mutual funds and private equity funds, sovereign wealth and family offices, and market-leading payers and health systems. We are proud of this diversified group of investors, which includes many of our strategic partners and customers. In building our company, we have capitalized our business with approximately $2.2 billion of gross proceeds to date from this blue-chip syndicate of long-term oriented, preeminent investors, sharing our enthusiasm for our mission and our long-term goals to build “New Pharma” at scale.
​



Our competitive advantage
Our business is built around several core tenets and capabilities that we believe will enable us to create “New Pharma” through patient-focused drug engineering, modern drug development and business model innovation, and sustain our competitive advantage over time. The biopharma industry, increasingly complex and burdened by legacy business models, needs a purpose-built solution, and incumbents may be unwilling or unable to replicate our business model. At the same time, new market entrants may find it difficult to replicate the people, assets, and capabilities that we have assembled at the scale required.

● | We have assembled a team of world-class drug hunters and developers. Our team, with decades of experience across platforms and modalities, including cutting-edge life and data science tool knowledge, continues to be instrumental in identifying targets and assets that fit our target profile at attractive prices and creating an efficient development path for regulatory approval and adoption. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have quickly built a pipeline to accelerate our business model. Since starting operations in the fall of 2019, we have already assembled a pipeline of more than 10 programs, including two late-stage clinical programs, three additional clinical stage programs and several undisclosed preclinical and drug engineering programs. The current portfolio alone represents therapeutic classes and indications that cover more than an estimated $100 billion in global specialty drug spend by 2026. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are establishing innovative strategic partnerships with payers and health systems globally. These partnerships, forged by our team with deep expertise and relationships across the payer, provider and integrated delivery network landscape, form the basis of our “Global Buyers Club” — a collection of customers with aligned incentives and deep engagement. These collaborations are rooted in transparency, trust, and a shared vision of value. Assuming we obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, we plan to leverage this platform to commercialize our future medicines, removing costs from the system, providing quantifiable value to our partners and patients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are building a purpose-built business model at scale. Our novel business model, a “first mover advantage” building scale rapidly, can become a competitive moat, which we believe would be successively more difficult to replicate over time as we expand our catalog of medicines, build out our Global Buyers Club, and generate greater savings for payers and patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​



Building a catalog of affordable medicines
Our growing catalog of medicines in development is targeting therapeutic classes, like oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases, and including indications such as lung cancer, breast cancer, rheumatoid arthritis or atopic dermatitis, that are creating the highest-cost burden to patients and society. These include drug classes with therapies available to patients today that are pressuring healthcare budgets as well as classes of medicines that are anticipated to be blockbusters adding further cost pressure in new and evolving drug classes in the future. The targets we select generally still have multiple years of patent protection securing high prices and large revenues of incumbents before generic entry is anticipated potentially lowering prices. It is in these drug classes, with multi-billion spend and multi-year protection, that we have the opportunity to generate the greatest economic impact and significant savings for our payer and health system partners.
Equally importantly, we need to be convinced that we can create a potential therapy that, if approved, would be equally good or better than competing medicines. A strong efficacy and safety profile along with a significantly lower price creates the opportunity to be included as a therapy option and to be able to capture meaningful market share.
A final selection criterion for inclusion into our portfolio is to have an understanding of the mechanism of action and the underlying biology of disease. We believe this will result in a significantly higher probability of technical success, and while it does not eliminate all risk, we expect our probability of success will be improved versus the industry standard of one to two drug candidates out of ten.
​
​
​



With these criteria in mind, we have rapidly assembled a catalog of more than 10 drug programs, initially through in-licensing efforts and more recently through drug engineering collaborations, since commencing operations in late 2019. Our initial focus has been in oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases, and includes both small molecules and biologics, with five clinical-stage programs, and several undisclosed preclinical and drug engineering programs.
​
​



Our two late-stage clinical programs include:

● | Aumolertinib (EQ143) is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI), in-licensed from Hansoh (Shanghai) Healthtech Co., LTD and Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Company LTD (collectively, Hansoh) in 2020. Aumolertinib has demonstrated clinical activity in late-stage clinical trials in initial treatment of patients with EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including positive Phase 3 results, and in treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who have developed resistance after treatment with a first-generation EGFR inhibitor. Clinical trials of aumolertinib have treated over 700 patients. Aumolertinib obtained marketing approval in China for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, who have progressed on or after prior EGFR TKI therapy in 2020, and for the first line (1L) treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR sensitive mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations) in 2021. In addition, aumolertinib is currently being investigated in multiple Phase 3 clinical trials in China.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sugemalimab (EQ165, also known as CS1001) is an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody, in-licensed from CStone Pharmaceuticals (CStone) in 2020. Sugemalimab has demonstrated clinical activity in Phase 3 clinical trials in the treatment of Stage III and Stage IV NSCLC, respectively. We believe that sugemalimab is the only immune checkpoint inhibitor which has demonstrated positive Phase 3 results in broadly defined Stage III and Stage IV patient populations, including in patients with Stage III disease treated with either concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy. In clinical trials, over 1,600 patients have been treated with sugemalimab either as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies and sugemalimab has obtained marketing approval in China for the 1L treatment of patients with Stage IV NSCLC. In addition, sugemalimab is currently being investigated in a variety of solid tumors and lymphomas and has received orphan drug designation (ODD) in the U.S. for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma as well as breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) in the U.S. and China for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory extra-nodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (R/R ENKTL).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on industry publications and other available third-party market research, we currently anticipate the EGFR inhibitor market reach an expected $10 billion in global specialty drug spend by 2026. We further estimate the PD-1/PD-L1 market for the initial indications we are targeting, including NSCLC, gastric cancer and esophageal cancer, will reach $30 billion in global specialty drug spend by 2026. Taken together, our aumolertinib and sugemalimab programs are targeting indications with an expected $40 billion global specialty drug spend by 2026, with the immunotherapy drug class expected to see an incremental $20 billion in global specialty drug spend by 2026 beyond our initial indications.
We are in ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities in several geographies, and we anticipate our first regulatory filings for marketing approval will occur outside of the United States, starting in the second half of 2022. For aumolertinib, we expect to file for marketing approval for the treatment of NSCLC and for sugemalimab, we expect to file for marking approval for the treatment of Stage IV NSCLC. As we pursue interactions with regulatory authorities, we expect to have more clarity on our regulatory requirements and filing timelines.



Our other programs in our growing pipeline include clinical and preclinical stage assets in both oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases:

● | Lerociclib (EQ132) is a novel, oral, potent, and selective small molecule cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, which has been studied in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer and shown to be highly active in combination with estrogen receptor antagonists with an acceptable tolerability profile. Additionally, lerociclib is being evaluated in a Phase 2 trial in the United States and multiple other countries for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nofazinlimab (EQ176, also known as CS1003) is an anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody and is being evaluated in an ongoing global Phase 3 trial for the treatment of patients with primary liver cancer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | EQ121 is a novel, highly selective janus kinase-1 (JAK-1) inhibitor that is currently in multiple Phase 1 trials. Additionally, EQ121 is being evaluated in multiple Phase 2 trials in China for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additional undisclosed preclinical programs targeting large oncology and immune-inflammatory indications.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to rapidly assemble our portfolio, our current clinical-stage assets were in-licensed from biopharma companies around the world. In addition, in 2021, we have entered into multiple drug engineering collaborations with cutting-edge technology platform companies including leading technology enabled experimental platforms, machine-learning computational platforms and physics based computational platforms, to efficiently engineer molecules against well-specified targets for important chronic and life-threatening conditions. For example, we have announced collaborations with Exscientia and Relay Therapeutics for the engineering of small molecule therapeutics, AbCellera for the engineering of antibody-based therapeutics, Absci for the engineering of protein-based therapeutics, and Evotec for the engineering of multi-modality therapeutics.
With more than 10 programs today covering more than an estimated $100 billion in global specialty drug spend by 2026, our vision is to continue to grow our catalog of medicines in development. We aim to achieve this through a mix of in-licensing, drug engineering collaborations and working with partners that will use our drugs and drug candidates in combination with their experimental medicines. However, the drug development process is inherently uncertain, and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to scale as anticipated, nor that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approvals or commercializing any approved therapies in these markets.
​
​



Our Global Buyers Club
If our catalog of medicines in development represents our total addressable market, our ability to make our future medicines available to patients and to capture share in those markets is through strategic partnerships with our Global Buyers Club. The objectives of setting up these transparent, engaging, open, and trusted strategic partnerships is to improve access to important, new medicines, lowering patient out-of-pocket burden and to lower pharmacy spend for payers, providers, and integrated delivery networks.
Overview of the “New Deal”
We will enable those goals through radically lower pricing compared to market-leading medicines. In this “New Deal” that we are offering our strategic partners, we are asking them to help us achieve the following objectives:

● | reduce administrative hassles for physicians to prescribe and/or administer our future medicines;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | make medicines more affordable for patients, through the elimination or reduction of patient out-of-pocket costs; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | drive market adoption through “pull-through” efforts instead of traditional, expensive “push” models.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This level of transparency and engagement between a manufacturer and a payer is unprecedented in the biopharma industry. Our goal is to rebuild trust with payers, providers and healthcare systems as true partners, creating a new level of access and collaboration that is needed to drive change together from within the industry.
​



Progress assembling the Global Buyers Club
Today, we have partnership arrangements or non-binding memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with strategic partners that cover more than 180 million lives. Importantly, some of our current and potential partners are also investors in our company and represent multiple categories of payers, including integrated delivery networks, regional and national U.S. payers, PBMs, and single-payer systems. 
Additionally, we have a strategic collaboration agreement with Abdul Latif Jameel Health, part of the international diversified family business Abdul Latif Jameel. Through this agreement, Abdul Latif Jameel Health is our regulatory and commercial partner in selected markets throughout the Middle East region, as well as in Turkey and all of Africa.
We are working diligently to engage with potential future members of our Global Buyers Club in a dialog around shared goals of lowering the cost burden on patients, making innovative medicines more accessible, and reducing total drug costs to keep health budgets sustainable.
We expect that our future Global Buyers Club will ultimately include a range of private and public payers, including health insurance organizations, PBMs, integrated delivery networks, single payer systems and public payer organizations as well as health systems and clinical practice across geographies.

Our growth horizons
We expect to incur rapid growth and create value for patients and customers across three growth horizons:
​

● | Today: Building our pipeline and payer partnerships.
--+-----------------------------------------------------


o | We have announced positive Phase 3 results for our two late-stage clinical programs, aumolertinib and sugemalimab. We are in ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities in several geographies, and we anticipate our first regulatory filings for marketing approval will occur outside of the United States, starting in the second half of 2022.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Behind our lead assets are three mid-stage programs, our CDK4/6, PD-1, and JAK-1, as well as several other non-disclosed preclinical assets, creating additional opportunity for future value creation. In addition, we have signed multiple drug engineering collaborations to create additional molecules against pre-specified targets with well-defined profiles to further build our portfolio.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In parallel with our drug development efforts, we have partnership arrangements or non-binding MOUs with strategic public and private payers across multiple Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, currently covering more than 180 million lives, that serve as the foundation for the creation of our Global Buyers Club.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 2023 to 2027: Launching medicines, delivering revenue, and scaling our pipeline and payer partnerships.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | If approved, we expect to launch our lead programs – aumolertinib and sugemalimab – on a global basis outside Greater China and begin to generate significant revenue. Later in the decade, we expect to introduce our second wave of medicines, generating additional substantial revenue and delivering greater value to our strategic partners through savings and greater options to patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We expect to sign commercial agreements with a significant number of private and public payers and health system partners in the United States and globally.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | At this point, these proof points would validate “New Pharma” as an innovative, purpose-built business model that offers high quality, innovative drugs at lower prices through our new payer partnerships. While delivering these proof points, we anticipate that we will continue to grow our pipeline of in-licensed programs, drug engineering collaborations and combination partnerships, as we aim to access new targets and franchises, further adding to our catalog of medicines.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 2028 and beyond: Platform at scale with unprecedented access to innovate medicines for all.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We expect to have significant commercial volume passing through our platform as members of our Global Buyers Club, including U.S. and international payers and providers, have access to our deep catalog of medicines across multiple therapeutic areas.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | With our platform fully established, we expect to demonstrate meaningful savings to healthcare systems, reinforcing the value of our business model to the Global Buyers Club. We would expect further demand to access our catalog, as well as an expansive list of commercial agreements.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We also foresee opportunities for other innovators to place their medicines into our marketplace, which would allow them to leverage our purpose-built business model and access our Global Buyers Club. We expect the combination of a growing catalog of drugs with trusted, strategic partnerships to create a mutually reinforcing flywheel effect, encouraging more innovators to join our marketplace, generating compounding value for all stakeholders, and driving our growth into the next decade.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Additional information on our pipeline programs
Our late-stage clinical programs
Aumolertinib (EQ143) for treatment of 1L and adjuvant EGFR-mutated NSCLC
We are developing aumolertinib, a novel, irreversible, third generation EGFR TKI for the treatment of EGFR-mutated NSCLC. In July 2020, we in-licensed the exclusive development and commercialization rights of aumolertinib globally, excluding Greater China, from Hansoh. Hansoh retains rights to aumolertinib in Greater China, where it is approved by the National Medical Products Association (NMPA) of China for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, who have progressed on or after prior EGFR TKI therapy, and for the 1L treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR sensitive mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations).
Based on the clinical data generated to date with aumolertinib, recent pivotal trial results, and commercial approval in China, we believe that aumolertinib has the potential to expand treatment options for patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC, a market expected to double in the next five years to $10 billion. Our recent discussions with our payer partners suggest strong receptivity for a differentiated therapy option for patients in this space.
As of December 31, 2021, aumolertinib clinical trials, sponsored by Hansoh and conducted in China, have treated over 700 patients including:

● | The pivotal, Phase 3 randomized trial in the initial treatment of Chinese patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) NSCLC harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations (n=429). The trial compared aumolertinib 110 mg once daily (n=214) to gefitinib 250 mg once daily (n=215). The trial met its primary endpoint of improvement in progression-free survival (PFS). These data supported the approval by the NMPA of China for the 1L treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR sensitive mutations (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The pivotal, Phase 2 open-label, single-arm trial in Chinese patients with metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC who had developed resistance to a first-generation EGFR inhibitor (EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC) (n=244). The trial met the primary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR), and aumolertinib was well-tolerated. These data supported the approval by the NMPA of China for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC who have progressed on or after prior EGFR TKI therapy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 1 trials consisting of two components: a Phase 1a dose escalation phase (n=26) and a Phase 1b dose expansion phase (94 patients), with patients in China, the U.S., Australia, and Korea. The results demonstrated predictable pharmacokinetics (PK) and established the basis for the clinical activity and tolerability profile subsequently confirmed in pivotal trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​



In February 2021, our partner, Hansoh, disclosed topline results of its Phase 3 trial which demonstrated that aumolertinib met its primary endpoint of improvement of PFS in 1L treatment of patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB) or metastatic (Stage IV) EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), ORR, duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR) and depth in response (DepOR). Additional results from the trial, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2021 Annual Meeting, demonstrated that aumolertinib has the potential to provide significant benefits as initial treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Highlights from the trial include:

● | The median PFS, as evaluated by investigators, was estimated at 19.3 months for aumolertinib versus 9.9 months for gefitinib with a hazard ratio of 0.46 (Log-rank p-value < 0.0001). The effect of aumolertinib on OS will be available at a future timepoint when these data are mature.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | At a one-year landmark, 69% of patients treated with aumolertinib were free of disease progression compared to 46% of patients treated with gefitinib.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improvement in PFS in patients who received aumolertinib over gefitinib was observed across relevant subgroups of patients, including those with brain metastases.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aumolertinib was generally well-tolerated and adverse events (AEs) resulting in patients temporarily stopping or discontinuing treatment were less common with aumolertinib than with gefitinib.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drug-related AEs were reported in 197 (92%) and 206 (96%) patients treated with aumolertinib or gefitinib, respectively. Drug-related severe (Grade 3 or higher) AEs were reported in 43 (20%) and 57 (27%) patients treated with aumolertinib or gefitinib, respectively.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drug-related serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 9 (4%) and 24 (11%) patients treated with aumolertinib or gefitinib, respectively. Drug-related SAEs observed in ≥2 patients in either group were less commonly observed with aumolertinib versus gefitinib treatment: hepatic function abnormal (2 patients or 0.9% versus 9 patients or 4.2%), alanine aminotransferase increased (0 patients versus 4 patients or 1.9%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (0 patient versus 4 patients or 1.9%) and drug-induced liver injury (0 patient versus 2 patients or 0.9%).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The table below describes the commonly reported AEs (≥20% of patients, all causality). In terms of AEs related to the inhibition of wild-type EGFR, both rash (50 patients or 23% versus 89 patients or 41%) and diarrhea (35 patients or 16% versus 77 patients or 36%) were less commonly observed with aumolertinib versus gefitinib. Conversely, elevations in creatine phosphokinase were more common with aumolertinib (76 patients or 35% versus 20 patients or 9.3%) but were not associated with clinical consequences such as kidney or cardiac damage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


​
In August 2021, we initiated an open-label clinical trial to evaluate the comparative PK of aumolertinib following oral single dose administration in adult healthy volunteers of different racial and ethnic populations, for the purpose of establishing whether aumolertinib PK are sensitive to ethnicity. We enrolled 45 participants to this trial in the U.S. and New Zealand and completed the trial in December 2021. This trial demonstrated comparable PK in non-Chinese healthy volunteers with a diverse background.
Currently, aumolertinib is being investigated in multiple ongoing clinical trials. In addition to the aforementioned Phase 3 trial in NSCLC, these trials include:

● | A Phase 3 trial evaluating the effects of aumolertinib versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in patients with surgically resected Stage II-IIIB EGFR-mutated NSCLC (n=192), being conducted in China and sponsored by Hansoh. The primary endpoint is disease free survival (DFS) as assessed by an independent review committee. The key secondary endpoints include DFS assessed by investigators and OS.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 3 trial evaluating the effects of aumolertinib as a maintenance therapy in patients with Stage III unresectable NSCLC (n=150), being conducted in China and sponsored by Hansoh. The primary endpoint is PFS as assessed by an independent review committee. The key secondary endpoints include PFS as assessed by investigators, OS, ORR, DoR, DCR, and time to death/distant metastasis (TTDM).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 3 trial evaluating the effects of aumolertinib versus platinum-based chemotherapy in non-canonical EGFR mutations (n=220), being conducted in China and sponsored by Hansoh. The primary endpoint is PFS as assessed by an independent review committee. The key secondary endpoints include PFS as assessed by investigators, ORR, DoR, DCR, DepOR and OS.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 3 trial evaluating the effects of aumolertinib in combination with platinum-containing dual-agent agents vs. aumolertinib as 1L for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring sensitizing EGFR mutations (n=624), being conducted in China and sponsored by Hansoh. The primary endpoint is PFS as assessed by an independent review committee. The key secondary endpoints ORR, DoR, DCR, DepOR, PFS and OS.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We intend to conduct additional, multi-regional clinical trials to support the approval and adoption of aumolertinib in multiple geographies. We are currently in ongoing regulatory discussions and expect these trials to support the expansion of access to aumolertinib globally for the initial treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC.
As part of our differentiated business model and collaboration agreements with payers, we also intend to conduct clinical trials to generate evidence to support the adoption of aumolertinib in multiple geographies across the globe.
Sugemalimab (EQ165) for NSCLC and other cancers
We are developing sugemalimab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1, for the treatment of NSCLC, with Phase 3 clinical trials in both metastatic (Stage IV) and locally advanced/unresectable (Stage III) disease, as well as additional solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Authorized by a company based in the U.S., Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: LGND), sugemalimab was developed using the OmniRat transgenic animal platform, which can generate fully human antibodies in one stop. In October 2020, we in-licensed the exclusive development and commercialization rights of sugemalimab globally, excluding Greater China, from CStone. Pfizer, Inc. holds the exclusive development and commercialization rights to sugemalimab within Greater China, where it is approved by the NMPA of China for 1L treatment of patients with Stage IV NSCLC. Sugemalimab is the only PD-L1 inhibitor to have demonstrated the potential for progression-free survival benefit in broadly defined Stage III (locally advanced/unresectable) and Stage IV (metastatic) NSCLC patient populations, inclusive of Stage III patients treated with either concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy.
In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted sugemalimab ODD for the treatment of patients with T-cell lymphoma and both the FDA and the NMPA granted BTD for the treatment of patients with R/R ENKTL, a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Based on clinical data generated to date and recent pivotal trial results, we believe that sugemalimab has the potential to treat patients with Stage III and Stage IV NSCLC, a market estimated to be approximately $25 billion in global specialty drug spend by 2026. Our recent payer discussions suggest strong receptivity for a broadly effective and competitively priced immune checkpoint inhibitor.
As of December 31, 2021, sugemalimab clinical trials, sponsored by CStone, have treated over 1,600 patients including, but not limited to:

● | The Phase 3 double-blind, randomized GEMSTONE-302 trial, conducted in China, evaluating the addition of sugemalimab to platinum-based chemotherapy as an initial treatment for Stage IV squamous or non-squamous NSCLC. The GEMSTONE-302 trial met its primary endpoint of improvement in PFS for sugemalimab plus chemotherapy (n=320) as compared to chemotherapy alone (n=159). The benefit of adding sugemalimab to chemotherapy was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression level or pathologic subtype of NSCLC (squamous versus non-squamous), and the tolerability profile was acceptable. In a planned interim analysis, sugemalimab combined with chemotherapy met its key secondary endpoint of prolongation of OS and the benefit was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression level or pathologic subtype of NSCLC.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Phase 3 double-blind, randomized GEMSTONE-301 trial, conducted in China, evaluating sugemalimab as consolidation therapy in patients with locally advanced, unresectable Stage III NSCLC without disease progression after either concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy. The GEMSTONE-301 trial met its primary endpoint of improvement in PFS for sugemalimab (n=255) as compared to placebo (n=126). Sugemalimab demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile, with no new safety signals observed.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An ongoing Phase 2 single-arm, registrational trial, conducted in the U.S. and China, evaluating the activity and tolerability of sugemalimab in the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory ENKTL (n=80).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Completed Phase 1 and 1b trials for patients with a variety of advanced solid tumors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In August 2020, our partner, CStone, first announced that its Phase 3 GEMSTONE-302 trial met its primary endpoint in Stage IV NSCSLC. The most recent data, as of March 2021, was presented in September 2021 at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer 2021 World Conference on Lung Cancer (IASLC 2021 WCLC) and was published in January 2022 in The Lancet Oncology. Highlights from the GEMSTONE-302 trial include:

● | Sugemalimab combined with chemotherapy met the primary endpoint of improvement in PFS, as evaluated by investigators as compared with chemotherapy and placebo at the time of the pre-specified event-driven analysis. In a planned interim analysis, sugemalimab combined with chemotherapy met its key secondary endpoint of prolongation of OS and the benefit was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression level or pathologic subtype of NSCLC.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other key secondary endpoints included PFS as assessed by an independent review committee, PFS as assess by investigator in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%, ORR, DoR, and safety.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The findings showed that sugemalimab plus chemotherapy in Stage IV NSCLC patients resulted in statistically significant improvement in PFS. The median PFS was estimated at 9.0 months for the sugemalimab and chemotherapy combination group versus 4.9 months for the chemotherapy and placebo group with a hazard ratio of 0.48 (Log-rank p-value <0.0001).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A higher ORR (63% versus 40%, p-value < 0.0001) and longer median DoR (9.8 versus 4.4 months) were significantly improved with the addition of sugemalimab to chemotherapy as compared to chemotherapy alone.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The benefit of the addition of sugemalimab to chemotherapy was observed regardless of PD-L1 expression level, patient functional status, and the presence or absence of brain or liver metastases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sugemalimab added to chemotherapy was generally well-tolerated and no new safety signals were identified.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Treatment-related AEs were reported in nearly all patients in both groups with 317 (99%) and 153 (96%) patients in the sugemalimab/chemotherapy and chemotherapy groups, respectively. Treatment-related severe (Grade 3 or higher) AEs were reported in 182 (57%) and 91 (57%) of patients in the sugemalimab/chemotherapy and chemotherapy groups, respectively.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 73 (23%) and 31 (20%) patients in the sugemalimab/chemotherapy and chemotherapy groups, respectively. Commonly reported (≥2% of patients in either group) treatment-related SAEs included the following (sugemalimab/chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, respectively): anaemia (3.4% versus 3.1%), pneumonia (3.1% versus 4.4%), platelet count decreased (3.1% versus 2.5%), and neutrophil count decreased (1.9% versus 2.5%).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In May 2021, our partner, CStone, first announced that its Phase 3 GEMSTONE-301 trial met its primary endpoint in Stage III NSCLC. The most recent data, as of March 2021, was presented in September 2021 at 



the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2021 and was published in January 2022 in The Lancet Oncology. Highlights from the GEMSTONE-301 trial include:

● | Sugemalimab met the primary endpoint of improvement of PFS, as assessed by an independent review committee compared to placebo at the time of the pre-specified interim analysis. Key secondary endpoints included OS, PFS as assessed by investigators, ORR, DoR, and time to death/distant metastasis (TTDM).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The findings showed that sugemalimab as a consolidation therapy in Stage III NSCLC patients without disease progression after chemoradiotherapy resulted in statistically significant improvement in PFS as assessed by an independent review committee. The median PFS was estimated at 9.0 months for the sugemalimab group versus 5.8 months for the placebo group with a hazard ratio of 0.64 (Log-rank p-value = 0.0026).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The clinical benefit of sugemalimab as a consolidation therapy in Stage III NSCLC patients without disease progression after chemoradiotherapy was observed regardless of whether patients received concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy prior to sugemalimab.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sugemalimab was generally well-tolerated and no new safety signals were identified.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Treatment-related AEs were reported in 193 (76%) and 73 (58%) patients in the sugemalimab and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment-related severe (Grade 3 or higher) AEs were reported in 26 (10%) and 7 (6%) patients in the sugemalimab and placebo groups, respectively. Commonly reported (≥ 2% of patients in either group) treatment-related severe AEs included the following (sugemalimab versus placebo, respectively): immune-mediated pneumonitis (2.4% versus 0) and pneumonia (2.4% versus 0.8%).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 38 (15%) and 12 (10%) patients in the sugemalimab and placebo groups, respectively.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe the results of the GEMSTONE-301 and GEMSTONE-302 trials will advance the clinical application of immune checkpoint inhibitors and improve the availability of treatment for many patients with Stage III and Stage IV NSCLC. We expect these trials will support our ongoing regulatory discussions in multiple geographies regarding approval of sugemalimab for the treatment of Stage III and Stage IV NSCLC.
Currently, sugemalimab is being investigated in multiple ongoing clinical trials. In addition to the aforementioned Phase 3 studies in NSCLC, these studies include:

● | A Phase 2 pivotal trial evaluating sugemalimab in the treatment of relapsed/refractory extranodal natural killer T-cell lymphoma (n=80), being conducted in China and the U.S. and sponsored by CStone. The primary endpoint is ORR, as assessed by an independent review committee according to Lugano 2014 classification. The key secondary endpoints include ORR assessed by investigators, complete remission rate (CRR), partial remission rate (PRR), time to response (TTR), and DoR.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 3 trial evaluating sugemalimab in addition to chemotherapy in the initial treatment of metastatic gastric cancer (n=480), being conducted in China and sponsored by CStone. This trial has co-primary endpoints of overall and progression-free survival, as assessed by an independent review committee. Key secondary endpoints include ORR, DoR, and safety.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 3 trial evaluating sugemalimab in addition to chemotherapy in the initial treatment of metastatic esophageal cancer (n=540), being conducted in China and sponsored by CStone. This trial has co-primary endpoints of overall and progression-free survival. Key secondary endpoints include ORR, DoR, and safety.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We intend to conduct additional, multi-regional clinical trials to support the approval and adoption of sugemalimab in multiple geographies. We are currently in ongoing regulatory discussions and expect these trials to support the expansion of access to sugemalimab globally for the treatment of NSCLC patients.
As part of our differentiated business model and collaboration agreements with payers, we also intend to conduct clinical trials to generate evidence to support the adoption of sugemalimab in multiple geographies across the globe.
Additional clinical-stage assets
Lerociclib (EQ132) for estrogen receptor positive (HR+)/HER2- receptor negative (HER2-) breast cancer
We are developing lerociclib, a novel, oral, potent, and selective small molecule cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor for use in combination with other targeted therapies for the treatment of patients with HR+/HER2-metastatic breast cancer (mBC). In July 2020, we in-licensed the exclusive development and commercialization rights of lerociclib for the U.S., Europe, Japan, and all other global markets, excluding the Asia-Pacific region (except Japan), from G1 Therapeutics (G1), a U.S. based, Nasdaq listed biotech company. Genor Biopharma (Genor) holds the development and commercialization rights to lerociclib within the Asia-Pacific region (except Japan).
Currently, lerociclib is being evaluated in the following clinical trials:

● | A Phase 2 trial evaluating lerociclib in addition to standard endocrine therapy patients with HR+/HER2- mBC in the initial treatment or relapsed disease settings (n=100), being conducting in the United States and multiple other countries and sponsored by us. The primary endpoint is safety, including the incidence of AEs and SAEs by line of therapy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating lerociclib in combination with the estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant in patients with HR+/HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after endocrine therapy failure (n=110), being conducted in the United Kingdom, Georgia, Moldova, and Bulgaria, and sponsored by G1. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity and identify the dose and schedule for future trials of lerociclib.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating lerociclib in combination with osimertinib in EGFR-mutated NSCLC (n=36), being conducted in the U.S., Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan, and sponsored by G1. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity and identify the dose and schedule for future trials of lerociclib.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in December 2019, G1 reported preliminary Phase 1/2 clinical data in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Highlights from the trial included:

● | Continuously dosed, twice-daily lerociclib, in combination with fulvestrant, was well tolerated. Additionally, lerociclib could be dosed continuously without need for interruption for management of neutropenia.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Coadministration of fulvestrant had minimal impact on the PK of lerociclib.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The clinical activity data were consistent with those from other approved CDK4/6 inhibitors when used in combination with fulvestrant.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taken together, these results demonstrate the potentially differentiated clinical profile of lerociclib in combination with fulvestrant versus currently marketed CDK4/6 inhibitors, and suggest that lerociclib can be administered without need for dose interruption due to neutropenia, one of the main toxicities associated with 



CDK4/6 inhibition. Some CDK4/6 therapies require frequent blood testing for neutropenia and lerociclib has the potential to offer fewer office visits and blood draws, improving the experience for patients and reducing the burden on physician offices and costs to the healthcare system.
Nofazinlimab (EQ176) for advanced solid tumors
We are developing nofazinlimab, a novel, anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. In July 2020, the FDA granted nofazinlimab ODD for the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and in October 2020, we in-licensed the exclusive development and commercialization rights of nofazinlimab globally, excluding Greater China, from CStone. CStone retains rights to nofazinlimab (CS1003) in Greater China.
Our partner, CStone, reported that its Phase 1 trial in China (n=19) demonstrated that nofazinlimab monotherapy was well-tolerated at 60mg and 200mg Q3W with no dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) observed and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) not reached. CStone’s Phase 1b trial (n=20) evaluated nofazinlimab in combination with lenvatinib for the treatment of HCC and demonstrated an ORR of 40% and median PFS of 8.4 months. Currently, a global, randomized, Phase 3 trial is evaluating nofazinlimab in combination with lenvatinib in initial treatment of patients with advanced unresectable HCC (n=525). The trial is being conducted in multiple countries, including China and the U.S., and is sponsored by CStone. The co-primary endpoints are PFS, as assessed by an independent review committee, and OS. The key secondary endpoints include PFS as assessed by investigators, ORR, DCR, DoR, and time to progression (TTP).
EQ121 for rheumatoid arthritis and other I&I indications
We are developing EQ121, a highly selective, novel, JAK-1 inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other immune-inflammatory diseases. In April 2020, we in-licensed the exclusive development and commercialization rights of EQ121 globally, excluding Greater China, from Lynk Pharmaceutical (Hangzhou) Co, Ltd. (Lynk Pharmaceuticals). Lynk Pharmaceuticals retains rights to EQ121 (LNK-207) in Greater China.
Currently, we are conducting multiple Phase 1 trials in Australia and New Zealand which include both healthy subjects as well as RA patients. In the first substudy, the primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of EQ121 following oral single and multiple ascending dose administration in adult healthy volunteers; the key secondary endpoint is to characterize the PK of EQ121 following single and multiple ascending dose administration. In the second substudy, the primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of multiple doses of EQ121 in adults with RA who are on a stable oral methotrexate (MTX) regimen; key secondary endpoints include evaluation of the effect of MTX on the PK of EQ121 and the effect of EQ121 on the PK of MTX. Lynk Pharmaceuticals is also conducting a Phase 1 trial in China in healthy subjects, and multiple Phase 2 trials in China for the treatment ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.
Preclinical programs and drug engineering collaborations
In additional to our five clinical-stage programs, our preclinical pipeline includes several undisclosed preclinical assets and discovery programs through our drug engineering collaborations. These assets and programs are focused on oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases that are expected to have large, multi-billion-dollar market opportunities.
We have entered into multiple drug engineering collaborations with cutting-edge technology platform companies including leading technology enabled experimental platforms, machine-learning computational platforms and physics based computational platforms. These are multi-year, multi-target collaborations intended to accelerate the engineering of therapeutic drug candidates against selective targets across a range of therapeutic areas, further expanding the breadth of our pipeline of novel therapies when combined with our internal drug development efforts. We will carefully evaluate additional opportunities to collaborate with 



additional drug discovery companies on cost-effectively creating new molecules should that make sense financially and from a business point of view.
In June 2021, we entered into our first drug engineering collaboration with Exscientia, which we then followed by agreements with AbCellera (August 2021), Relay Therapeutics (August 2021), Absci (October 2021) and Evotec (November 2021). We believe these drug engineering collaborations have the potential to help accelerate growth of our catalog of medicines.
We do not currently have, and may never have, any products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue to date, and so may never become profitable. In addition, our business and pricing model is untested and may never be successful or generate sufficient revenue to lead to profitability. We also note that the drug development process is inherently uncertain and cannot be fully de-risked, and there is no guarantee that the clinical trials we may conduct in the future will provide us with positive or actionable data that will facilitate efficient clinical development. For more details regarding these and other risks that are material to our business, operations and future share price, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Warrants.”
Licenses and collaborations
A key component of our strategy is to build our catalog of affordable medicines. We plan to do this using multiple strategies, including entering into agreements to in-license assets, drug engineering collaborations, and combination programs.
Material license agreements
We believe that the license and collaboration agreements for our two late-stage clinical assets, aumolertinib (EQ143) and sugemalimab (EQ165) are material agreements in light of our current near-term business plans and development strategy. Our agreement with CStone, described in more detail below, also gives us rights to nofazinlimab (EQ176, also known as CS1003), an anti-PD-1 antibody that is in an ongoing Phase 3 trial for the treatment of liver cancer patients, and our agreements with Lynk Pharmaceuticals for EQ121 and with G1 for Lerociclib, also described below, further support our near-term business plans and development strategy. We intend to continue into additional in-licenses for assets in various stages of development to build our catalog of affordable medicines.
Aumolertinib (EQ143)
In July 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Hansoh under which we acquired a worldwide exclusive license for the research, development, and commercialization of aumolertinib (EQ143) (also/previously known as almonertinib), for any and all uses for the treatment of cancer, cancer-related and immune-inflammatory diseases in humans at our own cost and expense, with the exception of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and its territories and possessions, including, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (the Hansoh Territory). We also received a non-exclusive license in the Hansoh Territory to research, develop and export aumolertinib for purposes of obtaining regulatory approval for, and commercialization of aumolertinib for use outside of the Hansoh Territory.

Competition
Since our founding, our strategy has been focused on developing an innovative business model where we have the potential to bring novel, patent-protected medicines to the market at radically lower prices through our strategic partnerships with our Global Buyers Club. While we do not believe there are currently any direct competitors that are positioned to offer their customers the broad and growing catalog of programs and shared economic incentives that we do, there are many companies that compete with certain components of our “New Pharma” solution.
The biopharma industry is highly competitive and dynamic, driven by rapidly advancing technologies and resulting in a proliferation of assets within drug classes. Our pipeline faces competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, drug engineering platforms, academic institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatments and new treatments that may become available in the future.
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, and marketing than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with larger and more established companies. These competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and in patient accrual to clinical trials, and acquiring programs complementary to our pipeline, among others.
Further, biopharma companies have not historically offered one transparent price for a branded drug but instead multiple prices that can vary widely for each payer, based on financial incentives offered to each gatekeeper in the value chain between the drug manufacturer to the patient. Due to this lack of transparency, we may not be aware of the financial or other incentives that our competitors are offering their customers or how their customer value proposition compares to ours.
Our commercial potential could be negatively impacted if competitors:

● | Develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, or are more convenient.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop and implement strategies that erode our anticipated cost advantage, including by lowering list prices, developing partnerships with payers, or offering other incentives.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With respect to the key success factors in our industry, including clinical efficacy and safety, breadth and depth of programs, affordability for patients and health systems, and quality of payer partnerships, we believe that our company and innovative business model will allow us to compete favorably. 
Intellectual property
We seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including by pursuing patent applications that cover our product candidates and methods of using 



the same, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are considered commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. Our commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce, and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights for the technology, inventions, and improvements we consider important to our business, and to defend any patents we may own or in-license in the future, prevent others from infringing any patents we may own or in-license in the future, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims, if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents and any issued patents we may obtain do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products.

Trade secrets
In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect our trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and partners. These agreements generally require that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all inventions resulting from 



work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Government regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, recordkeeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics. We, along with our vendors, contract research organizations (CROs), clinical investigators, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, will be required to comply with the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing, and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining and regulatory approvals of drugs and biologics and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and biologics under the FD&C Act and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, as amended, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing, approval, or any other requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing, advertising, promotion, packaging, labeling, export, import, distribution, or sale, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions or other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters, product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution.
Our product candidates must be approved for therapeutic indications by the FDA before they may be marketed in the U.S. For drug product candidates regulated under the FD&C Act, the FDA must approve a New Drug Application, or NDA. For biologic product candidates regulated under the FD&C Act and PHSA, the FDA must approve a Biologics License Application, or BLA. The process is similar and generally involves the following:

● | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | completion of the manufacture, under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually and when certain changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval or pre-license inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA or BLA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including, where applicable, consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical studies and clinical trials for drugs and biologics
Before testing any drug or biologic in humans, a product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulation and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety/toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies related to the product. The IND also includes the results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a full or partial clinical hold. The FDA must notify the sponsor of the grounds for the hold, and the sponsor must resolve any identified deficiencies before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA’s not allowing clinical trials to commence or not allowing clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A clinical hold can also be imposed once a trial has already begun, thereby halting the trial until the deficiencies articulated by the FDA are corrected.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, who generally are physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in the relevant clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring the product candidate’s safety and evaluating its effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable compared to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The 



FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (DSMB), which provides authorization for whether a study may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of the product candidate’s efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about clinical trials, including results for clinical trials other than Phase 1 investigations, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on www.ClinicalTrials.gov, a clinical trials database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.
A sponsor that wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA will nevertheless accept the results of the study in support of an NDA or BLA if the study was well-designed and well-conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, including requirements for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of the clinical trial in a way that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection if deemed necessary. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the U.S., the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless (i) the data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; (ii) the trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; and (iii) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through other appropriate means.
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs and BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.

● | Phase 1 — Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the investigational product in a limited population of healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, and distribution of the investigational product in humans, excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 — Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve the administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the drug’s potential efficacy, to determine the optimal dosages and dosing schedule, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 — Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve the administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA.

In August 2018, the FDA released a draft guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development (i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial) to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts is included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce development costs and time.



Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials or post-marketing studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of NDA or BLA approval.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 calendar days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected AEs, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human volunteers and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Expanded access
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application.
There is no requirement for a company to provide expanded access to its investigational products. However, if a company decides to make its investigational product available for expanded access, FDA reviews each request for expanded access and determines if treatment may proceed. Expanded access may be appropriate when all of the following criteria apply: the patient has a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment, and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be treated; and providing the investigational product for the requested use will not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the expanded access use or otherwise compromise the potential development of the expanded access use.
In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. While there is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients under the Right to Try Act, the 21st Century Cures Act requires the manufacturer to develop a policy for evaluating and responding to patient requests for expanded access. This policy must be made public and readily available and include company contact information and expected response times.



U.S. marketing approval for drugs and biologics
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy for the requested indications. A BLA is a request for approval to market a new biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the biologic’s safety, purity, and potency for the requested indications. The marketing application is required to include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug, or the safety, purity and potency of the investigational biologic, to the satisfaction of the FDA. The FDA must approve an NDA or BLA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs to ensure they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA or BLA. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective for the indications sought and whether the facilities in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged, or held and meets standards, including cGMP requirements, designed to assure and preserve the product’s continued identity, strength, quality, and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular entity NDA or BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular entity NDA or BLA for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by the FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification.
Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA adjusts PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) if it believes that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS can include use of risk evaluation and mitigation strategies like medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, special monitoring, or other risk-minimization tools.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug or biologic to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates, and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect 



one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
After evaluating the NDA or BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, but the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may require additional clinical or preclinical testing or recommend other actions, such as requests for additional information or clarification, that the applicant might take in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant ODD to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the U.S. for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. ODD must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. ODD does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, although companies developing orphan products are eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing and waiver of application fees.
If a product that has ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic agent for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a subsequent product’s showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the original applicant cannot produce sufficient quantities of product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different therapeutic agents for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same therapeutic agent for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for the same therapeutic agent for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. Further, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or the manufacturer of 



the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Rare pediatric disease designation and priority review vouchers
Under the FD&C Act, the FDA incentivizes the development of products that meet the definition of a “rare pediatric disease,” defined to mean a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and the disease affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States of such drug. The sponsor of a product candidate for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug application after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product, referred to as a priority review voucher (PRV). A sponsor may request rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA prior to the submission of its NDA or BLA. A rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that a sponsor will receive a PRV upon approval of its NDA or BLA. Moreover, a sponsor that chooses not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a PRV upon approval of its marketing application if it requests such a voucher in its original marketing application and meets all of the eligibility criteria. If a PRV is received, it may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has extended the PRV program through September 30, 2024, with the potential for PRVs to be granted through September 30, 2026.
Expedited development and review programs for drugs and biologics
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include fast track designation, BTD, priority review and accelerated approval. The purpose of these programs is to expedite the development or review of important new drugs and biologics to get them to patients more quickly than standard FDA review timelines typically permit.
A new drug or biologic is eligible for fast track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed. Rolling review means that the FDA may review portions of the marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application.
In addition, a new drug or biologic may be eligible for BTD if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. BTD provides all the features of fast track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient product development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and the FDA’s organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with fast track or BTD, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including priority review designation and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review once an NDA or BLA is submitted, if the product that is the subject of the marketing application has the potential to provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal date to take action on the marketing application is six months compared to ten months for a standard review. Products are eligible for accelerated approval if they can be 



shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, adequate and well-controlled additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or an indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period. After the 120 day period has passed, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review, or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, BTD, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval, although they may expedite the development or review process.
Pediatric information and pediatric exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), as amended, certain NDAs and BLAs and certain NDA and BLA supplements must contain data that can be used to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FD&C Act requires that a sponsor that is planning to submit a marketing application for a product candidate that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within 60 days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to a drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted, except that PREA will apply to an original NDA or BLA for a new active ingredient that is orphan-designated if the drug or biologic is a molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer.
A product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs and biologics
Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of AEs with the product, complying with promotional and advertising 



requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved label (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe approved products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but it does impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including not only by company employees but also by agents of the company or those speaking on the company’s behalf, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Promotional materials for approved drugs and biologics must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication, and may be required to be reviewed in advance in certain circumstances such as for products that receive accelerated approval. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement, which may be denied or may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements on sponsors and their CMOs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that a sponsor may use. Additionally, manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug and biologic products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements may subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual program user fee for any marketed product.
The FDA may withdraw approval of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Health Care Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

United States patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of a drug or biologic, some United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. An NDA or BLA applicant may apply for restoration of the patent term for its currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond a patent’s current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is considered a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides for three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
United States biosimilars and exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, (collectively, the ACA), signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biologic products 



that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biologic product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars in the U.S. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biologic product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference product.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
Other regulatory matters
Manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, sales, promotion, and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also potentially subject to federal, state, and local consumer protection and unfair competition laws, among other requirements to which we may be subject. Additionally, the activities associated with the commercialization of product candidates is subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and government agencies.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive recordkeeping, licensing, storage, and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements may subject companies to legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, relabeling or repackaging, or refusal to allow a company to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any claim or action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defended against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on marketing, sales, or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in statutes, regulations, or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional recordkeeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.



Other healthcare laws
Coverage and reimbursement
Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on these governments or payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private payers is critical to new product acceptance. Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.
There is also significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage, and reimbursement of newly approved products and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, an agency within the HHS. CMS determines whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payers tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Further, due to the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, millions of individuals have lost or may lose employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products.
Payers determining reimbursement level consider multiple factors, including whether the product is:

● | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | safe, effective, and medically necessary;
--+------------------------------------------


● | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


● | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


● | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the U.S. government, such as average sales price (ASP) and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S., and generally prices in the European Union tend to be significantly lower than those in the United States.



Other healthcare laws and compliance requirements
In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, CMS, other divisions of HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. Our clinical research, sales, marketing, scientific/educational grant programs, collaboration agreements, and partnerships with third-party payers, providers, PBMs, and other entities may be subject to the following laws, each as amended, as applicable:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and providers, prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, among others, on the other. The HHS and OIG, heavily scrutinizes relationships between pharmaceutical companies and persons in a position to generate referrals for or the purchasing of their products such as healthcare providers and PBMs; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by, Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the False Claims Act. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, which imposes requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses (collectively, covered entities) as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, or protected health information. HITECH
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency requirements under the ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which require applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign analogs of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payer. Many U.S. states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payers, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state and require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws, including for example the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, also govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements, and, if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties. 
Healthcare reform
Payers, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or private, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and those methods are not always specifically adapted for new technologies. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In particular, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, was enacted, which, among other things, subjected biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% 



pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an Executive Order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The Executive Order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge repeal or replace the ACA, will impact our business.
Prior to the Biden administration, on October 13, 2017, former President Trump signed an Executive Order terminating the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. The former Trump administration concluded that cost-sharing reduction payments, or CSRs, to insurance companies required under the ACA have not received necessary appropriations from Congress and announced that it will discontinue these payments immediately until those appropriations are made. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. On August 14, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in two separate cases that the federal government is liable for the full amount of unpaid CSRs for the years preceding and including 2017. For CSR claims made by health insurance companies for years 2018 and later, further litigation will be required to determine the amounts due, if any. Further, on June 14, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payers that argued the payments were owed to them. On April 27, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, concluding that the government has an obligation to pay these risk corridor payments under the relevant formula. It is unclear what impact these rulings will have on our business.
In addition, CMS published a final rule that would give states greater flexibility as of 2020 in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repeals the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Further, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional action is taken by Congress. Pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), as well as subsequent legislation, these reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through 



March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction will occur beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction will resume on July 1, 2022. Additionally, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will challenge, reverse, revoke, or otherwise modify these executive and administrative actions after January 20, 2021.
Further, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At a federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. The FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation (MFN), Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologics based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in OECD countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. The MFN Model regulations mandate participation by identified Part B providers and would have applied to all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2027. The MFN is currently subject to ongoing litigation. Further, authorities in Canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the Canadian drug supply from shortages. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada and the MFN Model may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates in Canada and other OECD countries. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Other U.S. environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste 



products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties, or other sanctions.
Personal data processing
The collection, use, transfer, disclosure, retention, security, and other processing of personal data (including, without limitation, clinical trial data and other personal health data) (collectively, Process or Processing) may be subject to independent and overlapping data security and privacy regulatory frameworks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These frameworks are evolving and may impose potentially conflicting obligations. For example, in the European Economic Area (EEA), the GDPR, which became effective May 25, 2018, governs the Processing of personal data (GDPR). The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that Process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers (such as clinical trial sponsors) of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” Processing, limitations on retention of personal data, special provisions for “sensitive information” including health and genetic information of data subjects, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data, like the United States. Such transfers of personal data outside of the EEA require the use of a valid “transfer mechanism” and, in many cases, the implementation of supplementary technical, organizational and/or contractual measures. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines of up to €20 million or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to request deletion of personal data in certain circumstances, and claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Notwithstanding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, by operation of the so-called “UK GDPR”, the GDPR continues to apply in substantially equivalent form in the context of the United Kingdom (UK), UK establishments and UK-focused personal data Processing operations. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the EU Commission recently adopted adequacy decisions for the United Kingdom to facilitate data transfers between the EU and the United Kingdom, the respective provisions and enforcement of the GDPR and UK GDPR may diverge in the future and create additional regulatory challenges and uncertainties. Additionally, other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar privacy and data protection laws, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business. For example, Brazil enacted the General Data Protection Law, New Zealand enacted the New Zealand Privacy Act, China enacted its Personal Information Protection Law, and Canada introduced the Digital Charter Implementation Act.
In the United States, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires 



covered businesses to provide certain disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, as well as the right to request, modify, and delete personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, and the California State Attorney General submitted final regulations for review on June 2, 2020, which were finalized and are now effective. The California State Attorney General has commenced enforcement actions against violators as of July 1, 2020. Further, a new California privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was passed by California voters on November 3, 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022). Other U.S. states also are considering omnibus privacy legislation and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas. For example, Virginia recently enacted the Consumer Data Protection Act that will become effective on January 1, 2023, and is similar to the CCPA and CPRA, and Colorado recently enacted the Colorado Privacy Act, which will become effective on July 1, 2023, and which is similar to the CCPA and Virginia law. While the CCPA and CPRA provide exceptions for certain activities involving data collected in the context of clinical trials, health data governed by California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, and PHI governed by HIPAA, and other state laws may contain similar exceptions, we cannot yet determine the impact the CCPA, CPRA, or other such existing or future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.
Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, achieving, and maintaining compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations such as the GDPR, UK GDPR and CCPA will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place new or additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with current, evolving and new data protection requirements. This may be an onerous undertaking and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Government regulation of drugs and biologics outside of the United States
European drug development
Our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements in the European Union. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. 
In April 2014, the European Union adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the new Regulation offer sponsors the possibility to choose between the requirements of the previous Directive and the new Regulation if the request for authorization of a clinical trial is submitted in the year after the new Regulation became applicable. If the sponsor chooses to submit under the previous Directive, the clinical trial continues to be governed by the Directive until three years after the new Regulation became applicable. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years after the Regulation became applicable, the new Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The new Regulation is directly applicable in all Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State), and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the European Union. The main characteristics of the new Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all European Union Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States) of a draft report 



prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have also been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
European drug review and approval
In the European Union, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization (MA). There are two main types of MAs:

● | The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the European Union and the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, including products produced by certain biotechnological process, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (i.e., gene-therapy, somatic cell therapy, or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the European Union, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, which makes the final decision to grant a marketing authorization within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding stop clocks, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.

● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the European Union, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, all of which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment report, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all of the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States).

Under the procedures described above, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety, and efficacy.



European data and market exclusivity
In the European Union, innovative medicinal products (including both small molecules and biologic medicinal products), sometimes referred to as new active substances, approved on the basis of a complete independent data package, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the European Union, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed in the European Union until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests, and clinical trials.
European orphan drug designation and exclusivity
In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan designation to promote the development of products that: (1) are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions; (2) either (i) such condition affects no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (ii) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or, if such a method exists, the product in question would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
In the European Union, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing approval for the orphan product. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, marketing authorization may only be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process in the EEA.
European pediatric investigation plan
In the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or the PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric 



indication of the drug for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative) are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension (if any is in effect at the time of approval). In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
PRIME designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines (PRIME), scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where the marketing authorization application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (meaning there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment in the European Union or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage), and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the EMA’s CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
Post-approval requirements
Similar to the United States, in the EEA, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the Member States. The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. This obligation to appoint a qualified person for pharmacovigilance similarly applies in the United Kingdom. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (PSURs).
All new MA applications must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising, and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer 



advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under European Union directives, the details are governed by regulations in each Member State and can differ from one country to another.
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians or other health care professionals to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is usually governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the United Kingdom. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the United Kingdom despite its departure from the European Union.
Payments made to physicians or other healthcare professionals in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
The aforementioned European Union rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
Pricing and reimbursement
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. The delivery of healthcare in the European Union, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than European Union, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of healthcare and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so-called health technology assessments (HTAs)) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval.
The European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union Member States may approve a specific price for a product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals, and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union Member States and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States) can further reduce prices. Special pricing and reimbursement rules may apply to orphan medicinal products. Inclusion of orphan medicinal products in reimbursement systems tends to focus on the 



medical usefulness, need, quality and economic benefits to patients and the healthcare system as for any drug. Acceptance of any medicinal product for reimbursement may come with cost, use, and often volume restrictions, which again can vary by country. In addition, results-based rules of reimbursement may apply.
Brexit and the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit, and the United Kingdom officially withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020 (Transition Period), during which the European Union’s rules continued to apply. However, the European Union and the United Kingdom have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and European Union pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented European Union legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the European Union regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current European Union regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the European Union and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of United Kingdom and European Union pharmaceutical legislation.
Great Britain is no longer covered by the European Union’s procedures for the grant of centralized marketing authorizations (as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, Northern Ireland will be covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered as a Concerned Member State under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). A separate marketing authorization will therefore be required to market drugs in Great Britain. All medicinal products with a valid centralized MA on January 1, 2021 were automatically converted into Great Britain MAs (unless the MA holder opted out of such a conversion). For two years starting on January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom’s regulator, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), may adopt decisions taken by the European Commission on the approval of new marketing authorizations through the centralized procedure, and the MHRA will have regard to marketing authorizations approved in a country in the EEA (although in both cases a marketing authorization will only be granted if any Great Britain-specific requirements are met). Various national procedures are now available to place a drug on the market in the United Kingdom, Great Britain, or Northern Ireland, with the main national procedure having a maximum timeframe of 150 days (excluding time taken to provide any further information or data required).
Since January 1, 2021, a separate process for orphan designation has applied in Great Britain. There is now no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation (as there is in the European Union) in Great Britain and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of a marketing authorization application for a United Kingdom or Great Britain MA. The criteria for orphan designation are the same as in the European Union, save that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g., there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned in Great Britain, as opposed to the European Union, and the prevalence of the condition must be no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in Great Britain).
The UK has implemented the now repealed Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). The extent to which the regulation of clinical trials in the UK will mirror the new Clinical Trials Regulation now that has come into effect is not yet known, however the MHRA has opened a consultation on a set of proposals designed to improve and strengthen the UK clinical trials legislation. Such consultation is open until 14 March 2022.



China – Human Genetic Resources Approval
According to the Interim Measures for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources, promulgated by China’s Ministry of Science and Technology and Ministry of Health (MOH) jointly on June 10, 1998, an additional approval is required for any foreign companies or foreign affiliates that conduct trials in China. Prior to beginning a trial, the foreign sponsor and the Chinese clinical trial site are required to obtain approval from the Human Genetic Resources Administration of China, or HGRAC, which is an agency under the Ministry of Science and Technology, to collect any biological samples that contain the genetic material of Chinese human subjects, and to transfer cross-border the samples or associated data. Furthermore, one of the key matters that is subject to the HGRAC review and approval process is the IP sharing arrangement between Chinese and foreign parties. The parties are required to share patent rights to inventions arising from the analysis of the samples. Conducting a clinical trial in China without obtaining the relevant HGRAC preapproval will subject the sponsor and trial site to administrative liability, including confiscation of HGRAC samples and associated data, and administrative fines.
On July 2, 2015, the Ministry of Science and Technology issued the Service Guide for Administrative Licensing Items concerning Examination and Approval of Sampling, Collecting, Trading, Exporting Human Genetic Resources, or Taking Such Resources out of the People’s Republic of China, or PRC, which provides that foreign-invested sponsors that sample, collect, or research human genetic resources in clinical trials shall be required to apply for approval of the China Human Genetic Resources Management Office through its online system. On October 26, 2017, the Ministry of Science and Technology issued the Circular on Optimizing the Administrative Examination and Approval of Human Genetic Resources, which simplified the approval for sampling and collecting human genetic resources for the purpose of commercializing a drug in the PRC. On May 28, 2019, the State Council of PRC issued the HGR Regulation, which became effective on July 1, 2019. The HGR Regulation regulates the collection, preservation, usage and provision abroad of China’s human genetic resources. According to this regulation, “human genetic resource” includes human genetic resource materials and information. Human genetic resource materials refer to organs, tissues, cells and other genetic materials containing human genome, genes and other genetic materials. Human genetic resource information refers to information, such as data, generated by human genetic resources materials. The Ministry of Science and Technology is responsible for the management of human genetic resources at the national level, and the administrative departments of science and technology under the provincial governments are responsible for the management of human genetic resources at local level. Foreign entities, individuals and such entities established or actually controlled by foreign entities are not allowed to collect or preserve China’s human genetic resources or provide human genetic resources abroad. If foreign entities and individuals and foreign-established or foreign-controlled entities intend to use China’s human genetic resources for conducting scientific research, they must comply with the applicable Chinese laws, regulations and rules (including any approval requirements) and carry out such research through collaboration with Chinese research institutions, universities, medical institutions or enterprises. The HGR Regulation formalized the approval requirements pertinent to research collaborations between Chinese and foreign-owned entities. Pursuant to the new rule, a new notification system (as opposed to the advance approval approach originally in place) is put in place for clinical trials using China’s human genetic resources at clinical institutions without involving the export of human genetic resources outside of China.
Rest of the world regulation
For other countries outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, privacy, information security, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.



Manufacturing
We developed our manufacturing strategy with the aim to deliver reliability, quality, and affordability for our future customers, the Global Buyers Club. We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. As such, we are developing robust and replicable manufacturing processes and analytical methods in concert with world-class, global CMOs. Additionally, we plan to maintain efficient use of inventory, leveraging advanced supply chain planning capabilities and storing inventory at the most strategic points of the value chain to also ensure reliability of supply for us and our combination partners, as appropriate.
For clinical supply, we use CMOs that act in accordance with the FDA’s cGMP for the manufacturing of drug substance and product. We expect to rely on third parties for the production of all clinical supply drug substance and drug product. We use additional contract manufacturers to fill, label, package, store and distribute investigational drug products. It is our intent to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide drug substance and drug product services (including packaging and distribution) as products move into the regulatory approval stage for any product candidates that complete clinical development. In parallel, we are designing our supply chains for late-stage clinical programs with dual sourcing of both drug substance manufacturing and drug product formulation.
All of our CMOs have Quality Management Systems in line with U.S., EU and UK regulatory expectations and our internal quality function has full oversight responsibility, including on-site pre- and post-approval inspections, for those suppliers. The quality oversight is ensured through the supply and quality agreements agreed with all of our suppliers.
As our portfolio expands, we will continue to evaluate whether there is strategic benefit to internalizing certain technologies or processes. This assessment will be based on our priorities of quality, reliability, and affordability, as well as risk management factors, including geopolitical.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2021, we had 242 full-time employees, of which 57 have M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. At such date, we also had two part-time employees, and approximately 50 consultants/contractors. Within our workforce, 129 employees are engaged in research and development and 115 are engaged in business development, finance, legal, and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be very strong, as evidenced by our more than 30 awards for company culture and leadership.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
