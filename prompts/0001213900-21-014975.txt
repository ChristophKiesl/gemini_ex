ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
 
GI Dynamics, Inc. (“GI Dynamics” or “the Company”) is a clinical stage medical device company focused on the development and commercialization of EndoBarrier, a medical device system intended for treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and reduction of obesity. EndoBarrier is a medical implant designated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the reduction of obesity with nearly 4,000 implants since inception and is the subject of an approved FDA pivotal trial in the United States under which the Company initiated patient implant procedures in January 2020. The Company believes that EndoBarrier represents a paradigm-breaking approach to traditional management of type 2 diabetes, which has focused historically solely on lifestyle intervention and diabetes medications. According to the article “Challenges in Diabetes Management: Glycemic Control, Medication Adherence, and Healthcare Costs,” published in the American Journal of Managed Care in 2017, these historical treatments for type 2 diabetes are limited in efficacy, with approximately 40% of patients achieving glycemic control.
 
EndoBarrier represents the first material departure from this historical approach. The Company believes that EndoBarrier offers an adjunct to non-insulin diabetes pharmacotherapy, while providing patients a chance to significantly reduce or eliminate insulin and increase the likelihood of avoiding invasive and permanent bariatric or metabolic surgery. EndoBarrier is designed to mimic the mechanism of action of the duodenal-jejunal exclusion currently created by gastric bypass surgery (which is referred to as Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, or RYGB), as explained in the article “EndoBarrier: A Safe and Effective Novel Treatment for Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes?”, published in Obesity Surgery in 2018 by Nisha Patel. After implanting EndoBarrier, the patient’s food that exits the stomach will flow through the inside of the EndoBarrier Liner, and therefore will not contact the wall of the upper intestine (duodenum and jejunum). The food will also not mix with fluids from the pancreas and bile duct until these fluids and the food reach the far end of the EndoBarrier Liner. It is believed that, in a similar fashion to RYGB, shunting the food to a more distant location in the upper intestines triggers hormonal responses that regulate key factors that help control hunger, satiety, and insulin sensitivity, which is also explained in the article by Nisha Patel.
 
EndoBarrier has been shown in multiple independent clinical studies to lower blood sugar levels (as measured by hemoglobin A1c or HbA1c), reduce excess body weight, increase insulin sensitivity, and positively affect other health metrics and comorbidities. Because it has been utilized in approximately 4,000 procedures, EndoBarrier has a thoroughly characterized benefit-risk profile. A recent independent meta-analysis published in 2018 by Pichamol Jirapinyo in American Diabetes Association (ADA) Diabetes Care, “Effects of the Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass Liner on Glycemic Control in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes with Obesity: A Meta-Analysis with Secondary Analysis on Weight Loss and Hormonal Changes,” provides the most comprehensive review and meta-analysis of EndoBarrier clinical data to date. In addition, two ongoing EndoBarrier registries in the UK and Germany have captured and reported clinical results on more than 800 patients between the two databases. These registries as well as other investigator-initiated trials continue to release clinical data on an annual basis, largely centered around the annual meetings hosted by DDW (Digestive Disease Week) in May, ADA (American Diabetes Association) in June, EASD (European Association for the Study of Diabetes) in October, and Obesity Week in November.
 
Business Strategy
 
The Company’s goal is to become the leading provider of alternative options for treating type 2 diabetes and concurrently reducing obesity. The Company’s corporate priorities include:
 

1) | US Clinical Operations: Conduct Stage 1 of the STEP-1 EndoBarrier pivotal trial in the United States.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company is focused on the successful execution of the STEP-1 pivotal trial in the United States. In August 2018, GI Dynamics received notification from the FDA that it had approved the Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) application for EndoBarrier, and received required Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, in February 2019. The approved EndoBarrier IDE represents the pivotal clinical trial for EndoBarrier.

The STEP-1 clinical trial is a randomized, controlled, double blinded trial with 3:1 randomization between patients who receive the EndoBarrier implant (3) and the control group made up of patients who will receive a sham procedure and not receive the EndoBarrier implant (1). Both arms will maintain pharmacotherapy within ADA guidelines and will receive lifestyle and nutritional counseling consistent with ADA guidelines. The primary endpoint of the trial is reduction of HbA1c from baseline to removal of the EndoBarrier at twelve months as compared to the control group. The study includes numerous secondary endpoints, including changes in weight, cardiovascular risk metrics, as well as health metrics related to NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), and CKD (chronic kidney disease).
 
The STEP-1 clinical trial consists of two stages. The first stage consists of 50 EndoBarrier patients and approximately 17 control patients. At the end of stage 1, the Company will submit four DMC (Data Monitoring Committee) reports to the FDA for review. Upon a successful completion of the stage 1 review, the Company will submit a request to the FDA to complete the study by conducting stage 2, which the Company anticipates will be comprised of 130 EndoBarrier patients and approximately 43 control patients for a study total of 240 patients (180 EndoBarrier and 60 control patients). There is no guarantee that this will be the final composition of the study, as the number of remaining stages or remaining patients may vary based on the stage 1 clinical data and the outcome of the stage 1 review with FDA. In addition to the multiple staged study, the FDA has mandated certain stopping rules which, if triggered, could result in the STEP-1 study having enrollment or treatment delayed or stopped.
 
On January 27, 2020, the first patient was randomized into the STEP-1Trial Protocol. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic. From the time of that declaration, the public safety restrictions adopted at the federal, state, and individual clinic policy level have impacted the ability to enroll patients after March 11, 2020. The EndoBarrier implantation procedure is classified as an elective procedure and was thus impacted by policies that disallowed elective procedures. In the fourth quarter of 2020, select clinical trial sites have been engaged in pre-screening activities to identify potential enrollees, although an increase in COVID-19 positivity rates and resulting policies on elective procedures, patient caution, and individual infections have prevented randomization of any additional enrollees prior to March 11, 2021. The Company continues to focus on potential patient identification and will resume enrollment and randomization as early as possible, presumably in the first half of 2021 due to the availability of the SARS-Cov2 vaccines and the assumption that the vaccines will continue to provide protection against emergent viral variants. Pending timely release of the COVID-19 restrictions, the Company expects to complete the enrollment of Stage 1 by the end of 2021.
 

2) | India Partnership: Conduct the I-STEP EndoBarrier pivotal trial in India as part of the Apollo Sugar partnership.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
GI Dynamics is focused on the successful execution of the EndoBarrier trial in India as part of its partnership with Apollo Sugar, which was announced on November 27, 2018.
 
The I-STEP study is also a randomized, controlled, double blinded trial with 3:1 randomization between patients who receive the EndoBarrier implant (3) and the control group made up of patients who will not receive the EndoBarrier implant (1). The primary endpoint of the trial is reduction of HbA1c from baseline to removal of the EndoBarrier at twelve months as compared to the control group. The study includes numerous secondary endpoints, including changes in weight and reduction in cardiovascular risk metrics. The study includes 100 patients in total, which consists of 75 patients who will receive the EndoBarrier implant and 25 control patients. Up to five clinical sites in India will participate in the study.
 
Apollo Sugar is a collaboration between Apollo Health & Lifestyle Limited and Sanofi. Apollo Sugar is a division of Apollo Hospitals Group (Apollo) focused on the treatment of metabolic disorders and operates an integrated network of centers of excellence for diabetes, obesity and endocrinology. Apollo is the largest private hospital system in India and has emerged as Asia’s foremost integrated healthcare services provider, maintaining a robust presence of hospitals, pharmacies, primary care and diagnostic clinics across the healthcare ecosystem. Since its inception, Apollo has treated over 65 million patients from 141 countries.
 
2



In April 2020, the Company and Apollo Sugar filed a pre-trial application with the Central Drugs Standards Control Organization (CDSCO) in India to obtain approval to initiate the I-STEP trial. As of March 11, 2021, the Company has not received communication from CDSCO regarding the timing of a response to the application, with the delay likely related to COVID-19 disruption in India. The Company expects to receive approval and initiate the trial in the first half of 2021, pending the removal of COVID-19 disruption and restrictions. Once initiated, the partners anticipate trial enrollment will take less than 12 months.
 
GI Dynamics and Apollo Sugar leadership are working to finalize the terms of the GI Dynamics-Apollo Sugar partnership that will focus on the marketing, distribution and clinical support of EndoBarrier to appropriate patients in India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Final terms of the proposed collaboration are subject to negotiation and will be disclosed upon completion.
 

3) | Gain CE Mark: Work with new Notified Body to gain EndoBarrier CE mark.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
CE Marking of a product is a manufacturer’s declaration that a product meets the applicable health, safety, and environmental requirements outlined in the appropriate European product legislation and has undergone the relevant conformity assessment procedure. A CE Mark is required before the Company can market EndoBarrier in the EU and certain Middle Eastern countries. In 2020, the standards for a medical device CE mark were scheduled to change from the Medical Device Directive (“MDD”) to the more stringent Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”), but largely due to the impacts of COVID-19, the deadline for conversion to MDR has been postponed. The Company has initiated the review process under MDD regulation with a new Notified Body, the independent third party commissioned to evaluate the conformity of products and the associated quality systems for manufacturers that seek to sell products in Europe.
 
Summary
 
In summary, GI Dynamics believes that EndoBarrier represents the most effective new treatment option in a market dominated by pharmaceutical companies generating annual revenue in excess $40 billion. The Company believes that EndoBarrier is poised to have a transformative and disruptive effect on the type 2 diabetes market. EndoBarrier is one of the few treatment options that treats type 2 diabetes, concurrently reduces obesity, and continues to show lasting treatment effects post treatment in many patients. As the duration of the EndoBarrier treatment effect continues to increase in published literature and because, to date, there has been minimal observed clinical risk after EndoBarrier removal, the EndoBarrier risk-benefit balance continues to evolve in an increasingly positive manner.
 
Background of the Disease
 
Diabetes mellitus type 2 (also known as type 2 diabetes) is a long-term progressive metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and reduced insulin production. People with type 2 diabetes represent 90-95% of the worldwide diabetes population; only 5-10% of this population is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (a form of diabetes mellitus wherein little to no insulin is produced).
 
Being overweight is a condition where the patient’s body mass index (BMI) is greater than 25 (kg/m2); obesity is a condition where the patient’s BMI is greater than 30, with some countries applying a lower metric to both definitions. Obesity and its comorbidities contribute to the progression of type 2 diabetes. Many experts believe obesity contributes to higher levels of insulin resistance, which creates a feedback loop that increases the severity of type 2 diabetes for many patients.
 
When considering treatment for type 2 diabetes, it is optimal to address obesity concurrently with diabetes. According to the article “Mechanisms of Insulin Resistance in Obesity,” published in Frontiers of Medicine in 2013 by Jianping Ye, absent the concurrent reduction of obesity with the treatment of type 2 diabetes, obesity will likely continue to contribute to the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes. It is the Company’s belief that the inability of the current pharmacologic options to fully treat type 2 diabetes is due to the fact that diabetes medications generally treat blood sugar levels only and do not contribute substantially to weight loss.
 
3



Current Treatment Options
 
According to the American Diabetes Association 2018 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, the current treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes is lifestyle therapy combined with pharmacological treatment, whereby treating clinicians prescribe a treatment regimen of one to four concurrent medications that could include insulin. Insulin usage carries a significant risk of increased mortality and may contribute to weight gain, which in turn may lead to higher levels of insulin resistance and increased levels of blood sugar, as explained in the article “Insulin-associated weight gain in diabetes--causes, effects and coping strategies,” by Russel-Jones, D. Only 40% of patients treated pharmacologically for type 2 diabetes are adequately managed, meaning that medication does not lower blood sugar adequately and does not halt the progressive nature of diabetes for these patients, as explained in the article “Adherence to Therapies in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes,” by Luis-Emilio Garcia-Perez.
 
The current pharmacological treatment algorithms for type 2 diabetes fall short of ideal, creating a large and unfilled efficacy gap. GI Dynamics believes that EndoBarrier, which is designed to mimic the mechanism of action of duodenal-jejunal exclusion currently created by RYGB gastric bypass surgery and operates in a relatively similar manner by reducing both weight and long-term blood sugar levels, can fill this gap by treating type 2 diabetes and reducing obesity in a unique minimally invasive and reversible manner.
 
Market Opportunity
 
Unmet Clinical Needs in the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity.
 
In 2019, the International Diabetes Federation estimated there were approximately 463 million people with type 2 diabetes worldwide. Diabetes is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness, and lower-limb amputation in almost all countries.
 
Three years after initial diagnosis, over half of patients with type 2 diabetes require multiple drug therapies. Studies have shown that only 40% of the type 2 diabetes population is adequately managed pharmacologically, as explained in the article “Challenges in Diabetes Management: Glycemic Control, Medication Adherence, and Healthcare Costs,” published in the American Journal of Managed Care in 2017. At ten years post diagnosis, most patients, despite insulin use in many, struggle to reach their hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) treatment goals. HbA1c is a glycosylated hemoglobin molecule found in the bloodstream that is formed when red blood cells are exposed to blood glucose. HbA1c has become the generally accepted gold standard biomarker for measuring levels of diabetes control in clinical practice and in human trials.
 
Many patients and health care systems struggle to meet the financial burden imposed by the numerous concurrent medications required to attempt to control the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes.
 
According to the World Health Organization, in 2016 more than 1.9 billion adults 18 and older were overweight. Of these, 650 million people worldwide are diagnosed with obesity (BMI ³ > 30 kg/m 2), a condition often leading to serious health consequences such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, and some cancers.
 
Those suffering from both type 2 diabetes and obesity, also referred to as diabesity, total more than 169 million worldwide, represent a significant public health problem not only in the United States (US) but also globally, as explained in the article “Epidemiology of Obesity and Diabetes and Their Cardiovascular Complications,” published in the Circulation Research in 2016 by Shilpa Bhupathiraju. GI Dynamics believes that the unchecked worldwide rate of growth of the type 2 diabetes and obesity patient population represents one of the greatest unmanaged health risks in all of health care.
 
GI Dynamics believes EndoBarrier can treat patients with type 2 diabetes and reduce obesity in a safe, effective, nonpharmacological, and nonpermanent manner.
 
The Efficacy Gap
 
The Company’s intent in developing and seeking regulatory approval for EndoBarrier is to help clinicians deliver a unique treatment option to those patients suffering from type 2 diabetes, a disease state that sorely lacks innovative and broadly effective new treatment options.

GI Dynamics and its scientific advisors feel there must be a change in how the medical establishment currently treats obese patients suffering from type 2 diabetes because current treatment options are not effective. According to the International Diabetes Federation, the number of obese patients progressing to later stages of type 2 diabetes continues to grow at an alarming rate. Yet less than half of all type 2 diabetes patients are adequately managed by pharmacotherapy, and insulin carries serious risks and may in many cases contribute to the further progression of obesity. At the extreme end of the treatment spectrum, the treatment options are limited to different types of bariatric or metabolic surgery, which are highly invasive and irreversible procedures. Less than 1% of patients who are eligible for bariatric or metabolic surgery opt to undergo the procedure, as explained in the article “Recent advances in clinical practice challenges and opportunities in the management of obesity,” published by Andres Acosta in 2015 in the Gut .
 


The graphic above illustrates the multiple treatment options during the course of progression of type 2 diabetes:
 

● | Risk associated with treatment increases from left to right.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | Progression of diabetes and obesity health risk and cost increase vertically.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lifestyle therapy (lifestyle counseling including nutrition and exercise) is the first line of defense against the progression of type 2 diabetes and obesity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pharmacotherapy
--+----------------


o | Oral monotherapy follows lifestyle therapy, often with metformin as the first line of treatment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Multiple combinations may then be administered, as recommended by the American Diabetes Association and other diabetes associations around the world. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Ultimately, as disease progression continues, injected insulin may be prescribed. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Bariatric or metabolic gastric bypass surgery may represent a final option.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A significant and rapidly growing patient population falls into the efficacy gap, wherein the patient is inadequately managed by medication yet unwilling to undergo gastric bypass surgery. For patients who elect to undergo bariatric or metabolic surgery, the clinical gains may not be permanent, while the risk associated with the procedure is permanent. These risks include, but are not limited to, excessive bleeding, blood clots, infection and in some cases death. GI Dynamics believes that because EndoBarrier is minimally invasive, can mimic the effects of gastric bypass, and has minimal side-effects, EndoBarrier can uniquely fill this efficacy gap, as explained in the article “EndoBarrier: A Safe and Effective Novel Treatment for Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes?” published in Obesity Surgery in 2018 by Nisha Patel.
 
The EndoBarrier Solution
 
EndoBarrier is intended for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the reduction of obesity in a minimally invasive and reversible manner. EndoBarrier is designed to mimic the mechanism of action of duodenal-jejunal exclusion created by gastric bypass surgery. The EndoBarrier System is provided sterile and consists of an EndoBarrier Liner preloaded, packaged and sterilized within the EndoBarrier Delivery System. The EndoBarrier Delivery System is utilized to deliver the EndoBarrier Liner to the proximal small intestine. The EndoBarrier Liner is removed using the EndoBarrier Retrieval System.
 
The EndoBarrier System consists of three primary components:
 


● | EndoBarrier — The EndoBarrier or EndoBarrier Liner is a 60-cm-long implant consisting of a thin, flexible, impermeable fluoropolymer liner coupled to a proprietary nitinol Anchor Mechanism. A gastroenterologist implants the EndoBarrier Liner into the patient’s duodenum in a minimally invasive manner using the EndoBarrier Delivery System and standard gastroscope. The EndoBarrier Liner is placed endoscopically (through the mouth and esophagus and into the stomach without cutting tissue). Once the EndoBarrier Liner is properly positioned in the patient’s duodenal bulb, the area within the duodenum just below the stomach, the EndoBarrier Delivery System is removed and the EndoBarrier Liner remains, held in place by a proprietary Anchor Mechanism. The EndoBarrier Liner remains in the body for a maximum intended duration of twelve months until removal, again via a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure using the EndoBarrier Retrieval System. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | EndoBarrier Delivery System — The EndoBarrier Liner is delivered using the Company’s proprietary sterile, single-use EndoBarrier Delivery System. This includes a custom-made Outer Catheter that is sufficiently flexible to allow for insertion through the patient’s mouth, through the stomach, and into the intestine without kinking. The EndoBarrier Liner is pre-assembled during manufacturing into a collapsed position inside the Capsule, which is located at the end of the Outer Catheter. The clinician uses the EndoBarrier Delivery System to advance the Capsule into the duodenum and deploy the EndoBarrier Liner from the Capsule. The delivery procedure is typically an outpatient procedure, during which the patient is under anesthesia or semi-sedation. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | EndoBarrier Removal System — The EndoBarrier Liner is removed at the end of the treatment period via a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure using the Company’s proprietary Retrieval System which is passed by the clinician through a standard gastroscope. The Hook of the EndoBarrier Removal System is used to pull either of two drawstrings located in the Anchor Mechanism. As the drawstring is pulled, the Anchor Mechanism is collapsed inward and disengages from the wall of the duodenum. The Hood, pre-placed on the end of a gastroscope, allows the EndoBarrier anchor assembly to be pulled and collapsed into the Hood with the Hood positioned to cover portions of the anchor. The EndoBarrier Liner is then safely removed through the patient’s stomach, esophagus, and mouth. The retrieval procedure is typically an outpatient procedure, during which the patient is under anesthesia or semi-sedation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
EndoBarrier has been shown in multiple company-sponsored and independent clinical studies to lower blood sugar levels (hemoglobin A1c or HbA1c), reduce excess body weight, and positively affect other health metrics and comorbidities.
 
EndoBarrier is not currently approved or commercially available in any jurisdiction.  In August 2018, GI Dynamics received notification from the FDA that it had approved its IDE application, pending IRB approval which was received in February 2019. To gain regulatory approval to commercialize EndoBarrier in the United States, the Company must submit a pre-market authorization (PMA) application for review and approval by the FDA.  In January 2020, GI Dynamics initiated treatment of patients in the STEP-1 pivotal clinical trial, which is the registration trial for the PMA application.
 
The EndoBarrier Effect
 
Obesity has been shown to exacerbate insulin resistance and contribute to the progression of type 2 diabetes. In situations where lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy have failed and surgery is not an option or is considered a therapy of last resort, EndoBarrier is intended to reduce blood sugar and weight. In clinical trials in both the United States and outside of the United States, EndoBarrier has been shown to:

● | significantly lower glucose levels;
--+------------------------------------


● | significantly lower body weight;
--+---------------------------------


● | lower cardiovascular-related risk factors.
--+-------------------------------------------

 
EndoBarrier utilization accomplishes this in many patients by affecting key hormones involved in insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, satiety, and food intake. (See the section titled “How EndoBarrier Works: EndoBarrier Mechanism of Action.”)
 
The Company’s intent in positioning EndoBarrier to fill the type 2 diabetes efficacy gap with concurrent reduction of obesity is to help patients and clinicians avoid the initiation of insulin therapy by helping many patients maintain lower HbA1c levels and slow or halt the progression of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, for those patients whose type 2 diabetes has progressed to the point where insulin therapy is necessary, EndoBarrier has been shown in many cases to lower HbA1c levels to the point where insulin dosage can be reduced, or insulin is no longer needed.
 
7



Finally, if the progression of type 2 diabetes is severe enough to warrant gastric bypass surgery, the Company expects that EndoBarrier either may serve as an opportunity to control type 2 diabetes so that surgery may not be needed, or at least better prepare the patient for bariatric surgery by lowering weight and helping control other comorbidities prior to surgery.
 
How EndoBarrier Works: EndoBarrier Mechanism of Action
 
The EndoBarrier mechanism of action is thought to be based on its functional similarities in many ways to RYGB. Once the EndoBarrier is implanted into the duodenum and proximal jejunum, ingested food passing through the EndoBarrier during the normal digestive process is prevented from interacting with the epithelium, microbiota, mucosal layer, or biliopancreatic secretions within the duodenum and proximal jejunum. In addition, EndoBarrier acts as a physical barrier that prevents the interaction of food with pancreatic enzymes and bile until reaching the end of the EndoBarrier Liner. Pancreatic enzymes and bile pass outside EndoBarrier and mix with the food at the distal end of the liner, where absorption ultimately takes place in the intestine. Thus, EndoBarrier creates a functional and reversible bypass of the upper intestine. Unlike RYGB surgery, EndoBarrier does not require an invasive and permanent surgical procedure or permanent physical modification of the stomach and exclusion of the distal stomach from the alimentary flow.
 
The Company’s scientific team and advisors have postulated the following EndoBarrier mechanisms of action, based on scientific evidence from such articles as “Effects of the Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass Liner on Glycemic Control in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes with Obesity: A Meta-Analysis with Secondary Analysis on Weight Loss and Hormonal Changes,” published in Diabetes Care in 2018 by Pichamol Jirapinyo and “The EndoBarrier: Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass Liner for Diabetes and Weight Loss,” published in Hindawi in 2018 by Aruchuna Ruban.:
 
Exclusion of the duodenum — This may offset an abnormality of gastrointestinal physiology responsible for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
 

● | Increased nutrient delivery to the distal small bowel — Additional findings suggest that the exclusion of the proximal intestine (foregut theory) and increase in nutrient delivery to the distal small bowel (hindgut theory) created by EndoBarrier likely induce neuro-hormonal changes and nutrient sensing that affect energy balance and glucose homeostasis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Secretion of GLP-1 — Partially digested nutrients reach the distal ileum, which stimulates the secretion of GLP-1 by L-cells located in this area. GLP-1 is known to regulate insulin secretion and action.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase in gut hormones — This contributes to the restoration of energy and glucose homeostasis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Elevated GLP-1 and PYY levels — Both levels are elevated as quickly as one-week post-implantation. Both hormones may play a role in satiety and body weight control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
There is no known evidence of occurrence of clinically significant caloric malabsorption with EndoBarrier. EndoBarrier covers only 60 cm of duodenal and proximal jejunal mucosa, which most likely represents less than 10% of the length of the small intestine and leaves almost the entire jejunum and ileum for digestion and absorption.
 
Operations and Financing
 
GI Dynamics began selling EndoBarrier in Europe and South America in 2010 and in Australia in 2011. Since inception, the Company has distributed almost 4,000 units of EndoBarrier and generated a total of $7.8 million in revenue. The Company has incurred net losses in each year since its inception.
 
The Company has five subsidiaries: GI Dynamics Securities Corporation, a Massachusetts-incorporated nontrading entity; GID Europe Holding B.V., a Netherlands-incorporated nontrading holding company; GID Europe B.V., a Netherlands-incorporated company that conducts certain European business operations; GID Germany GmbH, a German-incorporated company that conducts certain European business operations; and GI Dynamics Australia Pty Ltd, an Australia-incorporated company that conducts Australian business operations.

GI Dynamics has raised net proceeds of approximately $283 million through sales of the Company’s equity and placement of debt, of which $9.5 million was received in 2020 that included the debt portion of the 2019 financing and the Initial Close of the September 2020 Series A Preferred Stock Financing. Prior to going public on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”), the Company generated $75.7 million in proceeds, net of expenses, through the sale of convertible preferred stock to a number of US venture capital firms, two global medical device manufacturers, and qualified individual investors. In June 2011, the Company issued convertible term promissory notes to several of its stockholders totaling $6 million. In September 2011, the Company conducted an Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) in Australia and simultaneously conducted a private placement of CDIs to accredited investors in the United States. Net proceeds from these financings approximated $72.5 million, net of expenses and repayment of the June 2011 notes. In connection with the IPO, all existing shares of preferred stock were converted into common stock.
 
Between July 2013 and December 2016, GI Dynamics raised approximately $84.3 million, net of expenses, in offerings of the Company’s CDIs to qualified investors. In January 2017, GI Dynamics raised approximately $0.2 million, net of expenses, in an offering of the Company’s CDIs under a Security Purchase Plan (“SPP”) and in June 2017, GI Dynamics placed a Convertible Secured Term Promissory Note (the “2017 Note”, see Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete description of the terms and conditions of the financing).
 
In February and March 2018, GI Dynamics raised approximately $1.6 million in an offering of the Company’s CDIs to qualified investors and in May 2018, GI Dynamics placed a Convertible Term Promissory Note and Warrant (the “2018 Note and Warrant”, see Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete description of the terms and conditions of the financing). In September and November 2018, GI Dynamics raised approximately $5 million in an offering of the Company’s CDIs to qualified investors.
 
In October 2018, GI Dynamics announced that it signed an agreement with its new notified body Intertek to pursue CE marking of EndoBarrier in Europe. The Company has since suspended its relationship with Intertek and is working with a different notified body. In November 2018, the Company signed a clinical trial agreement and a memorandum of understanding with its clinical and potential commercial partner Apollo Sugar, a division of Apollo Hospitals Group located in India. In December 2018, GI Dynamics announced the appointment of Charles Carter, a consultant, as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. Mr. Carter became an employee of the Company on September 1, 2019.
 
In March 2019, the Company completed a Note Purchase Agreement (“March 2019 NPA”) detailing a convertible term promissory note (the “March 2019 Note”) and warrant (the “March 2019 Warrant”) financing with Crystal Amber for a gross amount of $1 million (see Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete description of the terms and conditions of the financing). In May 2019, the Company completed a convertible term promissory note (the “May 2019 Note”) and warrant (the “May 2019 Warrant”) financing with Crystal Amber for a gross amount of $3 million. (see Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete description of the terms and conditions of the financing). On June 30, 2019, Crystal Amber elected to convert the 2018 Note, the March 2019 Note and the May 2019 Note into an aggregate of 453,609,963 CDIs (representing approximately 9,072,197 shares of common stock).
 
On August 21, 2019, the Company and Crystal Amber entered into a securities purchase agreement for a total funding of up to approximately $10 million (the “August 2019 SPA”, see Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete description of the terms and conditions of the financing). In a series of scheduled transactions between August 2019 and November 2019, Crystal Amber exercised the 2018 Warrant, the March 2019 Warrant, and the May 2019 Warrant per the terms of the August 2019 SPA. In December 2019, the Company and Crystal Amber agreed to defer the funding of the August 2019 Note to January 2020.
 
On January 13, 2020, the $4.6 million August 2019 Note was funded by Crystal Amber and the August 2019 Warrant was issued to Crystal Amber, providing for the purchase of up to 229,844,650 CDIs (representing 4,596,893 shares of common stock) at $0.02 per CDI.
 
On June 18, 2020, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (“June 2020 NPA”) by and between the Company and Crystal Amber. Pursuant to the June 2020 NPA, the Company issued and sold to Crystal Amber, a Convertible Promissory Note in an aggregate original principal amount of $750 thousand, with terms including mandatory conversion in the event of the close of a Series A Preferred Stock offering.

GI Dynamics is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, where the majority of the Company’s employees work. The Company has subsidiaries in the Netherlands, Germany, and Australia, with employees in Germany and Australia.
 
Strategic Focus in 2021: The Path Forward 
 
The global COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health restrictions caused major disruption to the Company’s operations, specifically in the clinical hold on elective procedures pausing the Step-1 clinical trial enrollment in the United States, the COVID-19 related delay in receiving approval to initiate the I-Step trial in India, the COVID-19 related changes in the schedule and priorities of critical vendors in the application and review for CE Mark. With the majority of 2020 being disrupted due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our strategic goals for 2021 involve the resumption of the pursuit of our corporate strategy with an aggressive focus on time compression of key activities to make up for COVID-19 related delays. The complete resumption of activity will be dependent on both a release of the restrictions that impacted operations in 2020, but also a processing of prioritized backlogs by critical agencies and vendors.
 
The Company’s goal is to become the leading provider of alternative options for treating type 2 diabetes and concurrently reducing obesity. GI Dynamics intends to do this by conducting the following activities:
 

1) | U.S. clinical operations and pivotal trial: | Complete enrollment in Stage 1 of the STEP-1 pivotal trial in the US. 
---+-------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | India partnership and pivotal trial: | Initiate enrollment in the I-STEP pivotal trial in India. 
3) | Gain CE Mark: | Work with the Company’s notified body to gain the EndoBarrier CE mark. 

 
The Company will need to raise additional capital in 2021. 
 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s primary source of liquidity is its cash and restricted cash balances. GI Dynamics is currently focused on obtaining an EndoBarrier CE mark and enrolling the Company’s clinical trials, which will support future regulatory submissions and potential commercialization activities. Until the Company is successful in gaining regulatory approvals, it is unable to sell the Company’s product in any market at this time. Without revenues, GI Dynamics is reliant on funding obtained from investment in the Company to maintain business operations until the Company can generate positive cash flows from operations. The Company cannot predict the extent of future operating losses and accumulated deficit, and it may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability.
 
The Company has incurred operating losses since inception and at December 31, 2020 and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $296 million. The Company expects to incur significant operating losses for the next several years. At December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $1.2 million in cash and restricted cash.
 
The Company will need to arrange additional financing before August 1, 2021 in order to continue to pursue its current business objectives as planned and to continue to fund its operations. The Company is looking to raise additional funds through any combination of additional equity and debt financings or from other sources, however, the Company has no guaranteed source of capital that will sustain operations past August 1, 2021. There can be no assurance that any such potential financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient capital on the Company’s required timelines and on acceptable terms to stockholders and the Board of Directors, it could be forced to cease operations, including activities essential to support regulatory applications to commercialize EndoBarrier. If access to capital is not achieved in the near term, it will materially harm the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations to the extent that the Company may be required to cease operations altogether, file for bankruptcy, or undertake any combination of the foregoing. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these Consolidated Financial Statements are issued.

In addition, if the Company does not meet its payment obligations to third parties as they become due, the Company may be subject to litigation claims and its credit worthiness would be adversely affected. Even if the Company is successful in defending these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and would be a distraction to management and may have other unfavorable results that could further adversely impact the Company’s financial condition.
 
As a result of the factors described above, the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements include a going-concern disclosure. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information regarding the Company’s funding requirements.
 
Implications of Being a Smaller Reporting Company
 
We are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (1) the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates does not equal or exceed $250.0 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues did not equal or exceed $100.0 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates did not equal or exceed $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of any reduced disclosure obligations, it may make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.
Employees
 
At March 11, 2021, GI Dynamics has 12 full-time employees, 9 of whom are in the United States. None of the Company employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.
