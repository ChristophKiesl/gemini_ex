Item 1. Business
 
Description of the Company's Business
 
Gyrodyne, LLC (“Gyrodyne”, the “Company” or the “Registrant”) is a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of New York whose primary business has been the management of a geographically diverse portfolio of medical office and industrial properties and development of industrial and residential properties located in the Northeast region of the United States. 
 
Substantially all of our developed properties are subject to leases in which the tenant reimburses the Company for a portion, all of or substantially all of the costs and/or cost increases for utilities, insurance, repairs, maintenance and real estate taxes. Certain leases provide that the Company is responsible for certain operating expenses.
 
The Company manages its business as one operating segment. The Company’s corporate strategy since September 2015 has been to pursue zoning and/or entitlement opportunities intended to increase the values of our two remaining major properties so that they can be sold to a developer at higher prices than otherwise possible, thereby maximizing distributions to our shareholders during the liquidation process within a reasonable period of time and then dissolving the Company. The value of the real estate reported in the Statement of Net Assets as of December 31, 2016, does not include the appreciation that may result, if any, from such future value enhancement efforts.
 
Gyrodyne is the surviving entity in the merger of Gyrodyne Company of America, Inc. (the “Corporation”) and Gyrodyne Special Distribution, LLC (“GSD”) with and into Gyrodyne (the “Merger”), effective August 31, 2015. The Merger completed the Corporation’s plan of liquidation under the Internal Revenue Code. 
 
Our efforts to generate the highest values for Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor may involve in limited circumstances the acquisition of certain adjacent properties, pursuit of joint venture relationships, entitlements and/or zoning changes, other investments and/or other strategies to enhance the net value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor to maximize the returns for our shareholders. The Company does not expect the acquisition of properties or the pursuit of joint ventures, if any, to adversely affect the timing of distributions to our shareholders. Gyrodyne expects that it will dissolve after it has completed the disposition of all of its real property assets, has applied the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any debts and claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then has made liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. The liquidation process and the amount and timing of distributions involve risks and uncertainties. As such, it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate amount of proceeds that will actually be distributed to our shareholders or the timing of such payments. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets in liquidation presented in our Consolidated Statements of Net Assets. The actual nature, amount and timing of all distributions will be determined by Gyrodyne’s Board in its sole discretion, and will depend in part upon the ability to convert our remaining assets into cash in compliance with our obligations under the Stipulation entered into in connection with the class action lawsuit (See Item 3 – Legal Proceedings) and pay and settle our remaining liabilities and obligations. Under Gyrodyne’s Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, such dissolution may be effected upon the vote of holders of a majority of Gyrodyne common shares or, in the Board’s discretion and without any separate approval by the holders of the Gyrodyne common shares, at any time the value of Gyrodyne’s assets, as determined by the Board in good faith, is less than $1,000,000.

After giving effect to the Company’s dispositions of real property through December 31, 2016 (see Footnote 6), the Company owns one remaining medical office park and four of fourteen buildings in a second medical office park, together comprising approximately 48,000 rentable square feet and a multitenant industrial park comprising approximately 130,000 rentable square feet. The aforementioned industrial park is situated on ten acres of a 68-acre property in St. James, New York. Each of the medical office park in Cortlandt Manor, the group of four buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park and the Flowerfield Industrial Park (including its undeveloped portion) are individually owned in single asset LLCs wholly owned by the Company.
 
Properties Under Contract or Sold
 
Port Jefferson Professional Park. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company sold five buildings and one building, respectively, (approximately 4,000 square feet each) in the Port Jefferson Professional Park as follows:

 | Port Jefferson Medical Park Location | | Closing Date | Gross Sales Proceeds | 
------+--------------------------------------+---+----------------+----------------------+--------
 | | | | 2016 | | | 2015 | 
 | 5 Medical Drive | | December 2015 | | | | | $ | 760,000
 | 6 Medical Drive | | January 2016 | | 850,000 | | | | 
 | 8 Medical Drive | | June 2016 | | 820,000 | | | | 
 | 4 Medical Drive | | July 2016 | | 900,000 | | | | 
 | 3 Medical Drive | | August 2016 | | 876,000 | | | | 
 | 2 Medical Drive | | September 2016 | | 800,000 | | | | 
Total | | $ | 4,246,000 | | $ | 760,000 | 

 
The Company also entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated March 30th, 2017, to sell the two buildings located at 9 Medical Drive and 5380 Nesconset Highway, respectively, in the Port Jefferson Professional Park for $2,000,000 to Teresa Rainone and Hesham Atwa, subject to an evaluation period that will expire thirty days from signing (with an optional extension period of ten days), during which time the purchaser shall have the right to terminate the agreement by written notice to GSD Port Jefferson, for any reason or no reason, in which case the purchaser will have the right to receive a refund of its $100,000 deposit. Unless so terminated, the agreement provides for a closing within five days of the expiration of the evaluation period. 
 
Following the sale indicated above, the Company will have two remaining buildings (comprising approximately 7,700 square feet in total) within the same medical park which are being actively marketed for sale. 
 
Fairfax Medical Center. On May 4th, 2016, the Company sold the Fairfax Medical Center for $14,015,000. Based on the terms of the sale, the Company has a master lease obligation to the purchaser on approximately 3,852 square feet for approximately $155,000 over two years from the date of sale with payments due quarterly less any new leases or expansions signed by the buyer, which obligations will terminate if the financial obligation is satisfied through leases to one or more third party tenants. Based on the leasing activity since the closing date, the Company estimates the maximum obligation on the master lease has been reduced to $50,593 (net of the August 2016 lease payment of $16,878). 
 
The Comparison of the Gross sales proceeds to the net realizable value reported prior to entering the Purchase and Sale Agreement:
 
Sale Price | Net Realizable Value reported prior to entering the Purchase and Sale Agreement | Net Realizable Value reported in excess of Proceeds excluding the Master Lease Obligation
------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$14,015,000 | $ 14,000,000 | $ 15,000 

Strategic Plan to Enhance Property Values, Liquidate and Dissolve
 
Our corporate strategy since September 2015 has been to pursue zoning and/or entitlement opportunities intended to increase the values of our two remaining major properties so that they can be sold to a developer at higher prices than otherwise possible, thereby maximizing distributions to our shareholders during the liquidation process within a reasonable period of time and then dissolving the Company. Gyrodyne expects that it will dissolve after it has completed the disposition of all of its real property assets, has applied the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then has made liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common shares. To accomplish this, the Company’s plan will consist of:

● | managing the real estate portfolio to improve operating cash flow while simultaneously increasing the market values of the underlying properties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | managing the opportunistic sale of real estate assets;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | pursuing the re-zoning/entitlement efforts of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties, to maximize value;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | focusing use of capital by the Company to preserve or improve the market value of the real estate portfolio;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | balancing working capital and funds available for the development process with making distributions during the liquidation process.

Gyrodyne’s strategy is to enhance the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor by pursuing possible entitlement and/or zoning opportunities, which the Gyrodyne Board believes will improve the chances of obtaining better values for such properties. The value of the real estate reported in the Statement of Net Assets as of December 31, 2016, does not include the appreciation that may result, if any, from such value enhancement efforts. The pursuit of the highest and best use of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor may involve the acquisition of properties, pursuit of joint venture relationships and other investments and or other strategies to maximize the returns for our shareholders. The Company does not expect the acquisition of properties or the pursuit of joint ventures, if any, to adversely affect the timing of distributions to our shareholders. Gyrodyne expects that it will dissolve after it has completed the disposition of all of its real property assets, has applied the proceeds of such dispositions first to settle any claims, pending or otherwise, against Gyrodyne, and then has made liquidating distributions to holders of Gyrodyne common interests. We are unable to predict the precise nature, amount or timing of such distributions.
 
Sales of properties by Gyrodyne could take the form of individual sales of assets, as has been our recent experience in Port Jefferson, sales of groups of assets, a single sale of all or substantially all of the assets or some other form of sale. The assets may be sold to one or more purchasers in one or more transactions over a period of time. 
 
A sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company would require shareholder approval under New York law. However, in the event of the sale of individual properties, it is not required or anticipated that any shareholder votes will be solicited. The prices at which the various assets may be sold depend largely on factors beyond our control, including, without limitation, the condition of financial markets, the availability of financing to prospective purchasers of the assets, regulatory approvals, public market perceptions, and limitations on transferability of certain assets. 
 

 We cannot give any assurance on the timing of the ultimate sale of all of the Company’s properties. Assuming the liquidation process continues through the end of 2018, and giving effect to the estimated flow of cash from the operation of our existing properties, we expect that Gyrodyne will have a cash balance of approximately $28.1 million, prior to any future dividend distributions based on the estimate of net assets in liquidation presented in our Consolidated Statements of Net Assets. Such cash would equate to future liquidating distributions of $18.96 per share based on Gyrodyne LLC, having 1,482,680 common interests outstanding. These estimated distributions do not include any additional value that the Company believes it can derive from the investments it is making to maximize the value on Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor. While the real estate market is dynamic and the economy is volatile, the Company believes the rate of return from the estimated investment of $3.36 million on enhancement efforts will improve the estimated distributions versus selling the real estate under its current zoning and entitlements. In addition, approximately $1 million of land development costs are for environmental impact and other infrastructure studies that potentially could be utilized by a prospective buyer, however such value was not included in the fair value of the real estate as presented in the statement of net assets. 
 
The statement of net assets is based on certain significant estimates. Uncertainties as to the precise value of our non-cash assets, which exclude any estimated additional incremental value achievable from the costs incurred to pursue the maximum value on Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor through certain land development efforts (mainly restricted to researching highest and best use and the pursuit of certain related entitlements, special permits and or zone changes) and the ultimate amount of our liabilities make it impracticable to predict the aggregate net value ultimately distributable to shareholders in a liquidation. Land development costs, claims, liabilities and expenses from operations, including operating costs, salaries, income taxes, payroll and local taxes, legal, accounting and consulting fees and miscellaneous office expenses, will continue to be incurred during our liquidation process, which includes certain enhancement efforts. Excluding the value that may be achieved from the development efforts, expenses incurred in pursuing the Company’s business plan will reduce the amount of assets available for ultimate distribution to shareholders, and, while a precise estimate of those expenses cannot currently be made, management and our Board believe that available cash and amounts received on the sale of assets will be adequate to provide for our obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims (including contingent liabilities) and to make cash distributions to shareholders. However, no assurances can be given that available cash and amounts received on the sale of assets will be adequate to provide for our obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims and to make cash distributions to shareholders. If such available cash and amounts received on the sale of assets are not adequate to provide for our obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims, distributions of cash and other assets to our shareholders will be reduced and could be eliminated. In the event our shareholders receive distributions from Gyrodyne, LLC and there are insufficient funds to pay any creditors who seek payment of claims against Gyrodyne, shareholders could be held liable for payments made to them and could be required to return all or a part of distributions made to them.

Property Value Enhancement 
 
The Company is pursuing zoning/entitlements to maximize the value of Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor. During the twelve months ending December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $897,000 of land development costs, of which approximately $210,000 (inclusive of closing costs) was for the purchase of four acres of land adjacent to the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center. Approximately $116,000 of the balance was comprised of real estate taxes with the balance mainly attributable to market analysis and feasibility studies inclusive of traffic studies to determine the highest and best use intended to maximize the value to our shareholders with a low amount of risk. We anticipate that the acquired land will enhance the achievable development density and sale value of the Cortlandt property. We estimate that the Company may incur approximately $3.36 million in additional land development costs through 2018 in pursuit of entitlements (approximately $1.10 million in Cortlandt Manor and $2.26 million in Flowerfield).
 
The Company is focusing its resources on positioning the properties to be sold with all entitlements necessary to achieve maximum pre-construction values in the shortest period of time with the least amount of risk to the Company. During the process of pursuing such entitlements, the Company may entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay prices for the properties that the Company finds more attractive from a timing or value perspective than completing the entitlement processes. While the real estate market is dynamic and the economy is uncertain, we anticipate that these expenditures will serve to greatly increase the sale prices of the properties and the resulting liquidating distributions to our shareholders. 
 
Cortlandt Manor. On March 15, 2016, the Town of Cortlandt Manor (the “Town”) adopted a 2016 Sustainable Comprehensive Plan (the “Plan”) of which one key strategy was the simultaneous creation of a Medical Oriented District (“MOD”). The purpose of the MOD is to expand the Town’s existing medical infrastructure and encourage economic development, including capital investment, job creation and housing options. The MOD allows for a continuum of care, i.e., independent living, assisted living and nursing/hospital care, within or in neighboring facilities by centralizing medical services and related activities. As a designated zoning district, the MOD could include hospital, ambulatory surgery, primary and urgent care, hospice, laboratories, social services, boutique hotels and a wide range of housing. 
 
The Company’s existing 33,871 square foot Cortlandt Medical Center and its approximate twelve acres are located directly opposite New York Presbyterian’s Hudson Valley Hospital Center and within the boundaries of the MOD. The Company has committed resources toward both market research and feasibility studies in support of achieving entitlements to maximize the value of the property. For more than a year the Company along with its planner and engineers have been working closely with the Town to identify issues and solutions involved in creating the Plan and more specifically, the MOD. 
 
On March 13, 2017, the Company entered a purchase and sale agreement to purchase a 1,950-square foot single-family residential dwelling located on approximately 0.3 acres in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The purchase price is $319,512. The Company was able to take advantage of a distressed sale following foreclosure action by the lender. The property which adjoins the Cortlandt Medical Center and is across the street from New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital Center, is expected to become part of the Cortlandt Manor MOD. The property provides additional vehicular access to the site from Buttonwood Drive and State Route 202 and will provide for additional parking potential which the Company believes will further increase yield in a manner that is cost effective and should provide a significant return on investment to the shareholders.
 
The Company expects to file an application with the Town of Cortlandt Manor to develop the Cortlandt Manor property, on or about March 31, 2017, as follows:
   
SUBDIVISION LOT # | BUILDING SIZE/YIELD
------------------------+--------------------
MEDICAL OFFICE | 100,000 sft 
Multi-family apartments | 200 units 
Retail | 4,000 sft 

 
The Company has been working closely with Town officials on entitlement complexity, environmental impact studies, traffic mitigation, effluent, financial impact and other variables to ensure the application synchronizes with the Town’s vision on the MOD.
 
The development costs from December 2013 through year end December 31, 2016 associated with the ownership and development of this property consisted of architectural and engineering costs, legal expenses, economic analysis, soil management, surveys and real estate taxes totaling $565,416.

Flowerfield. Following extensive market research and related feasibility studies, we identified the entitlements that we believe will maximize the value of Flowerfield in the shortest amount of time with the lowest amount of risk. The Company has been in discussions with the Town of Smithtown on the potential real estate development projects identified by the market research and feasibility studies, all of which currently fall within our “as of right to build” zoning. We are also exploring with the Town of Smithtown whether it would be amenable to certain entitlements, special permits, or other concessions that would allow for the identified development projects. 
 
In March 2017, the Company filed a pre-application (the “Pre-application”) for the Flowerfield property along with the previously sold (2002) Catering hall facility for an eight-lot subdivision. With the Pre-application process now complete, the Company is proceeding with the comprehensive application based on feedback provided by the Town of Smithtown staff in the Pre-application process, as follows:
 

SUBDIVISION LOT # | LOT SIZE (acres) | LAND USE | BUILDING SIZE/YIELD 
------------------+------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------
1 | 16 | Existing Industrial Park – Mixed Use | 132,719 SFT 
2 | 12 | Catering Hall | 34,685sft 
3 | 6 | Hotel with restaurant, Spa/fitness and conference center | 150 Rooms plus 150 seat restaurant 10,000 sft 500 seats
4 | 4 | Medical Office /R&D Office building | 53,400 sft 
5 | 6 | Medical Office/R&D Office building | 76,350 sft 
6 | 2 | Assisted Living | 104 units 
7 | 3 | Assisted Living | 116 units 
8 | 25 | Common Area | 

 
In addition to lot 8, the plan envisions an open space network of trails, benches and passive recreation that will serve as a recreational amenity to tie together the uses with in the overall Flowerfield campus landscape. The development costs from December 2013 through year end December 31, 2016 associated with the ownership and development of this property consisted of architectural and engineering costs, legal expenses, economic analysis, soil management, surveys and real estate taxes totaling $942,486. The Company has an additional 5.2 acres bordering the industrial park that are currently zoned residential and are not part of the Pre-application.
  
While we cannot predict the outcome of the Pre-application, we can state that we have undertaken to subdivide the Flowerfield property in an accretive manner that is economically advantageous to both the Company and the surrounding communities.
 
As envisioned in the chart above, the Pre-application seeks to subdivide the Flowerfield property using a low-impact development campus approach that provides a complementary mix of land uses with a green space network throughout the subdivision. Opportunities for shared green space, roads, utilities and parking are incorporated into the plan and preserves the historic 200-foot setback from Route 25A. The Flowerfield campus would be a beautiful, environmentally sound and amenity enriched community that wouldn’t overly burden existing infrastructure and the local community with the additional costs of the education of elementary and high school students. We believe the campus will generate a significant new real estate tax base for the Town of Smithtown and the Smithtown Central School District. 
 
The Company’s Pre-application includes proposed uses for the subdivided lots, although the specific uses will be determined by the eventual purchasers. It is anticipated that the proposed uses described herein would be typical of those chosen by the future owners and as a result we requested that the subdivision be considered with those uses so that the purchasers of the lots would have an assigned density. The Company’s Pre-application includes perfecting the subdivision of the Catering facility (12 acres hereafter referred to as lot 2) which the Company sold in 2002.
 
In accordance with the draft Smithtown Comprehensive Plan Update, the new additions to the Flowerfield campus would be focused on uses supportive and beneficial to Stony Brook University (SBU), namely, the development of a first class 150 bed hotel with conference facilities, restaurant and health club; medical office facilities; and assisted living facilities. Furthermore, the connection with SBU via the existing LIRR crossing will help to foster synergy between Flowerfield and SBU.
 
Lot 1 encompasses the existing uses of the current light industrial park being retained thereby keeping in place jobs from the local business community, locations for back office operations of SBU, and studios for a vibrant arts community that yields cultural benefits to Smithtown and the surrounding communities.

Lot 2 owned by a third party. It is a catering facility that resides on a 12-acre lot that was sold in 2002. The subdivision was deferred by the town until the overall plan for Flowerfield is approved. 
 
Lot 3 is planned as a 150-room hotel that would include a 150-seat restaurant. The hotel could also have a 500-seat conference space and a 10,000-square foot day spa/fitness center. It is envisioned that this hotel would serve the adjacent catering facility, as well as the office uses on-site and the nearby SBU.
 
Lots 4 and 5 are envisioned as medical office, general office, or tech space (R&D) in support of SBU, its Hospital and Children’s Hospital, and its Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology (CEWIT). The two lots could be developed separately or as one larger lot. Approximately 129,750 square feet of office space in two buildings (53,400 and 76,350 sf) would be provided.
 
Lots 6 and 7 are envisioned as assisted living communities, comprising a total of 220 units, again either as two separate lots or one combined lot. There would be a synergy with the SBU Hospital and with the medical office uses for medical care of the residents of the assisted living facilities.
 
The Company has begun the process of pursuing entitlements, density and/or rezoning, and our ability to obtain required permits and authorizations is subject to factors beyond our control, including environmental concerns of governmental entities and community groups. The process will involve extensive analysis internally at the government entity level, as well as between government entities such as town planning departments and Gyrodyne, and will continue up until such time as entitlement, rezoning and density decisions are made by the relevant government entities. We hope to secure favorable decisions on entitlements, rezoning and density so that we can then seek the sale of our remaining properties at higher prices and then proceed with the liquidation and dissolution of the Company. The Company expects the process of pursuing entitlements, rezoning and density could range between six months and two years with the ultimate timing to a certain extent managed by Gyrodyne but ultimately dependent and under the control of the applicable municipality’s planning board or other governmental authority. 
 
Health Care Industry

Our tenants in our Cortlandt Manor and Port Jefferson properties are healthcare service providers. The healthcare industry is subject to substantial regulation and faces increased regulation particularly relating to fraud, waste and abuse, cost control and healthcare management. The healthcare industry may experience a significant expansion of applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations, previously enacted or future healthcare reform, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations or changes in enforcement priorities, all of which could materially impact the business and operations of our tenants and therefore the marketability of our properties. The recent U.S. presidential election, coupled with a Republican-controlled Congress, makes the repeal and replacement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) a possibility. A shift toward less comprehensive health insurance coverage and increased consumer cost-sharing on health expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our tenants’ financial conditions and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations. 
 
Our tenants and operators are subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure laws, regulations and industry standards governing business operations, the physical plant and structure, patient rights and privacy and security of health information. Our tenants’ and operators’ failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of licensure, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines or other penalties, suspension or exclusion from the government sponsored Medicare and Medicaid programs, loss of accreditation or certification, or closure of the facility. In addition, efforts by third-party payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private insurance carriers, including health maintenance organizations and other health plans, impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon healthcare provider operations (through changes in reimbursement rates and methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise). Our tenants and operators may also face significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees, all of which could impact their ability to pay rent or other obligations to us.
 
Real Estate 
 
The Company owns properties in St. James, Port Jefferson Station and Cortlandt Manor, New York. From March 2009 until May 2016, the Company owned a medical office property in Fairfax, Virginia, and has a remaining lease obligation on that property.
 
St. James, New York. In St. James, New York, the Company owns a 68-acre site called Flowerfield, primarily zoned for light industry, which is located approximately 50 miles east of New York City on the North Shore of Long Island in the Town of Smithtown. Flowerfield's location places it in Hydrogeologic Zone VIII, one of the most liberal with respect to effluent discharge rates. Gyrodyne currently has 130,533 square feet of rentable space located on approximately 10 acres of developed property at Flowerfield. As of December 31, 2016, there were 34 tenants, comprising 41 leases and 6 long-term tenants under month-to-month commitments. The annual base rent at Flowerfield based on the rates in effect as of December 2016 is $1,502,000 which included month-to-month annualized base rent of $385,000 on 16,553 square feet. The occupancy rate was 72% as of December 31, 2016. Studies including environmental, archeological, ecological and traffic have been conducted in connection with previous development plans, none of which had any significant adverse findings. The Company believes that material costs will not be incurred in connection with compliance with environmental laws. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no material expenses related to environmental issues. 
  
Port Jefferson Station, New York. On June 27, 2007, the Company acquired ten buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park in Port Jefferson Station, New York. The acquisition of this property qualified for deferral treatment under Section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code. The ten buildings were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of $8,850,000 or $225 per square foot. The Company funded $5,551,191 of the purchase price by the assumption of the existing mortgage debt on the property with the remainder in cash after adjustments. The balance of the mortgage was prepaid in full in January 2013 and assumed by a subsidiary of Gyrodyne which was later settled in full in connection with the Merger on August 31, 2015. The buildings were located at 1-6, 8, 9 and 11 Medical Drive and 5380 Nesconset Highway in Port Jefferson Station, and situated on 5.16 acres with 39,329 square feet of rentable space. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company sold five buildings (comprising approximately 20,000 square feet) for $4,246,000 and one building in 2015 (4,000 square foot building) for $760,000. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement on two buildings for $2,000,000 (approximately 7,400 square feet) and continues to actively market the remaining 2 buildings. As of December 31, 2016, there were 3 tenants, comprising 3 leases. The annual base rent based on the rates in effect as of December 2016 is $221,000. The occupancy rate was 55% as of December 31, 2016.

Cortlandt Manor, New York. On June 2, 2008, the Company acquired the Cortlandt Medical Center in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The property consists of five office buildings which are situated on 5.01 acres with 31,198 square feet of rentable space on the date of acquisition. The purchase price was $7 million or $231 per square foot. As of December 31, 2016, there were 11 tenants, comprising 15 leases. The annual base rent based on the rates in effect as of December 2016, is approximately $851,000. The property was 100% occupied as of December 31, 2016. Of the $7 million purchase price for the property, the Company paid $1,750,000 in cash and received financing in the amount of $5,250,000. The balance of the mortgage was prepaid in full in November 2012 and assumed by a subsidiary of Gyrodyne which was settled in full in connection with the Merger on August 31, 2015. The acquisition of this property qualified for the deferral treatment under Section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code. Following certain capital improvements, the rentable square feet currently is 31,421 square feet. 
 
On August 29, 2008, the Company acquired a 1,600-square foot single-family residential dwelling located on 1.43 acres at 1987 Crompond Road, Cortlandt Manor, New York. The purchase price was $305,000. The Company was able to take advantage of a distressed sale by the seller. The property is located directly across the street from New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital Center and adjoins the Cortlandt Medical Center. The property is zoned for medical office use by special permit and is potentially a future development site for expansion of the Cortlandt Medical Center. This property has not been mortgaged.
 
On May 20, 2010, the Company acquired the building located at 1989 Crompond Road, Cortlandt Manor, New York. The property consists of 2,450 square feet of rentable space on 1.6 acres. The purchase price for the property was approximately $720,000. This property is adjacent to the 1.43-acre property acquired by the Company in August 2008, and these two properties combined result in the Company owning approximately three acres directly across Crompond Road from the Hudson Valley Hospital Center in addition to the 5.01 acre Cortlandt Medical Center site. The Company financed approximately 90% of the purchase price utilizing its then revolving credit facility, which was prepaid in full in December 2012. The property was 100% occupied as of December 31, 2016, by two tenants with a total annual base rent of $33,600. 
 

 In March 2016, the Company acquired a four-acre undeveloped lot in Cortlandt Manor for $210,000, inclusive of closing costs, which the Company believes is synergistic to maximizing the value on that property. 
 
On March 13, 2017, the Company entered a purchase and sale agreement to purchase a 1,950-square foot single-family residential dwelling located on approximately 0.3 acres in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The purchase price is $319,512. The Company was able to take advantage of a distressed sale following foreclosure action by the lender. The property which adjoins the Cortlandt Medical Center and is across the street from New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital Center, is expected to become part of the Cortlandt Manor MOD (see, “--, “Property Value Enhancement – Cortlandt Manor”, above). The property provides additional vehicular access to the site from Buttonwood Drive and State Route 202 and will provide for additional parking potential which the Company believes will further increase yield in a manner that is cost effective and should provide a significant return on investment to the shareholders.
 
Fairfax, Virginia. On March 31, 2009, the Company acquired the Fairfax Medical Center in Fairfax City, Virginia. The property consisted of two office buildings which were situated on 3.5 acres with 57,621 square feet of rentable space at date of acquisition. The purchase price was $12,891,000 or $224 per square foot. Of the $12,891,000 purchase price, the Company paid $4,891,000 in cash and received financing in the amount of $8,000,000. The acquisition of this property qualified for the deferral treatment under Section 1033 of the Internal Revenue Code and completed the tax-efficient reinvestment program of the $26.3 million advance payment received in connection with the condemnation of the 245 acres of the Flowerfield property. The balance of the mortgage was prepaid in full in December 2012 and assumed by a subsidiary of Gyrodyne, and was later settled in full in connection with the Merger on August 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, there were 26 tenants, comprising 27 leases, renting space with an annual base rent of $1,425,000, based on the rates in effect as of December 2015. The occupancy rate as of December 31, 2015, was 88%. 
 
On May 4th, 2016, the Company sold the Fairfax Medical Center for $14,015,000. Based on the terms of the sale, the Company has a master lease obligation to the purchaser on approximately 3,852 square feet for approximately $155,000 over the two years following the sale date with payments due quarterly less any new leases or expansions signed by the buyer, which obligations will terminate if the financial obligation is satisfied through leases to one or more third party tenants. Based on the leasing activity since the closing date, the Company estimates the maximum obligation on the master lease has been reduced to $50,593 (net of the August 2016 lease payment of $16,878). 
 
Limited Partnership Investment in Callery-Judge Grove, L.P. The Company has a 10.12% limited partnership interest in Callery-Judge Grove, L.P. (the “Grove”). The Grove previously owned a 3,700+ acre citrus grove (the “Grove Property”) located in Palm Beach County, Florida as its only asset, which is the subject of a plan for mixed-use development. On September 19, 2013, the Grove Property was sold in a foreclosure proceeding to Minto Florida Developments, LLC (“Minto”) pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement which provided that the Grove had the right to receive certain payments on the sale of single family residential units constructed on the property or on the sale of the property itself. During 2016, Gyrodyne was informed by the Grove’s managing partner that Minto transferred the property to an affiliate which triggered an appraisal process that resulted in the payment by Minto to the Grove of $1,968,750. The Grove’s managing partner also informed Gyrodyne that the payment along with some of its existing cash would be utilized to repay certain debt obligations owed to certain limited partners in the amount of $2.7 million. In light of the foregoing, Gyrodyne believes that the Grove may not receive any additional payments from Minto beyond the aforementioned $1,968,750. In as much as the Grove’s obligations to certain limited partners exceed the payment it received from Minto, it is unclear what amount, if any, Gyrodyne could expect to receive in any final liquidating distribution from the Grove.

Tax Status
 
Prior to the Merger, Gyrodyne Company of America, Inc. qualified as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for federal and state income tax purposes under section 856(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”). As long as the Corporation qualified for taxation as a REIT, it generally was not subject to federal and state income tax. If the Corporation failed to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it would be subject to federal and state income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. Even if the Company qualified as a REIT, it may have been subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. The Corporation received PLR-135927-10 (“PLR”), a Private Letter Ruling dated March 1, 2011 addressing the tax impact to REIT status from condemnation proceeds. The PLR ruling stated the condemnation award would not be considered in determining whether the Corporation satisfied the REIT asset test under (i) Internal Revenue Code Section 856(c)(4) and (ii) under Section 856(c)(5)(J) the interest on the award and the reimbursement of costs derived from the claim would not be considered in determining whether the Corporation satisfied the REIT gross income test under sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3).
 
Following a change in tax law in January 2013, retroactive to January 2012, reducing the recognition period for REIT owned property applicable for the 2012 taxable year to five years, the Corporation applied for another private letter ruling from the IRS in March 2013 and ultimately received a favorable ruling on September 12, 2013. PLR-113874-13 concluded that the Corporation’s receipt of the additional damages in July 2012 in connection with the judgment in the Corporation’s favor in its condemnation litigation with the State of New York occurred outside of the applicable recognition period for 2012, and therefore permitted the Corporation to distribute, by means of a dividend such as the Special Dividend described below, the gains realized from its receipt of the 2012 Proceeds, subject to a 4% excise tax, in order to avoid incurring the corporate level tax.
  
On September 13, 2013, the Board declared the First Special Dividend, in the amount of $98,685,000, or $66.56 per share, of which approximately $68,000,000, or $45.86 per share, was paid in cash. The balance of the First Special Dividend was paid in the form of interests in GSD to which the Corporation transferred its real estate assets subject to mortgage obligations to a subsidiary of the Corporation of $13,840,889. GSD would generally be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes so long as 90 percent of its gross income is “qualifying income” under Section 7704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. “Qualifying income” includes real property rents and gain from the sale or other disposition of real property (including property held for sale to customers as described in section 1221 (a)(1)). If GSD failed to meet this requirement it would be taxable as a corporation.
 
In accordance with REIT distribution requirements, on December 20, 2013, the Corporation announced the Second Special Dividend of $10.89 per share which was paid on January 31, 2014 to shareholders of record on December 31, 2013. The dividend was paid in the form of interests in a subordinated global dividend note of $16,150,000 that was scheduled to mature on June 30, 2017. The annual interest rate was 5% payable semiannually in kind or cash on June 15th and December 15th. 
 
 
10



In addition, on September 15, 2014, the Board declared a special supplemental dividend in the amount of $682,033 (approximately $0.46 per share),which represented the remaining undistributed balance of the 2013 taxable income, paid in the form of non-transferrable uncertificated interests in a subordinated global dividend note issued on December 31, 2014 to all shareholders of record as of September 26, 2014 (the “2014 Dividend Note”, and together with the Dividend Note, the “Dividend Notes”). With the exception of the face value of the note, all terms and conditions mirror the terms and conditions of the previous notes issued. Accordingly, the allocation of Gyrodyne, LLC Shares previously designated for holders of interests in the subordinated global Dividend Note will be adjusted to reflect the addition of the $682,033 principal amount of the 2014 Dividend Note.
 
The Company’s investment in the Grove is held in FPI (deemed a taxable REIT subsidiary when the Corporation was a REIT) which also is the subsidiary that recorded the taxable operating results under the Corporation’s management services agreement with GSD. 
 
Following the completion of the Merger, effective September 1, 2015, Gyrodyne, LLC, the surviving company in the Merger, no longer qualifies as a REIT but is structured as a limited liability company which is treated as a partnership, a pass-through entity for Federal income tax purposes. Gyrodyne, LLC is generally treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes so long as 90 percent of its gross income is “qualifying income” under Section 7704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. “Qualifying income” includes real property rents and gain from the sale or other disposition of real property (including property held for sale to customers as described in section 1221 (a)(1)). If Gyrodyne, LLC fails to meet this requirement it may be taxable as a corporation. 
 
Under current law, when the IRS audits a partnership tax return, the IRS generally determines tax adjustments at the partnership level, but is required to collect any additional taxes, interest and penalties from each of the partners. 
 
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the “2015 Act”) changed this procedure for partnership tax audits and audit adjustments for partnership returns of large partnerships for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017. Pursuant to the 2015 Act, if any audit by the IRS of our income tax returns for any fiscal year beginning after December 31, 2017 results in any adjustments, the IRS may collect any resulting taxes, including any applicable penalties and interest, directly from Gyrodyne. IRS tax audit assessments on tax years beginning January 1, 2018 will require Gyrodyne to bear any tax liability resulting from such audit, as opposed to passing it through to our shareholders, unless we elect to push out the tax audit adjustments to our shareholders once it has been calculated at the company level. 
 
Following the merger, FPI, remains a “C” corporation subject to tax on the income, if any, from The Grove. The Company has a deferred tax asset of approximately $85,000 reflecting the tax basis in excess of book, the benefit of which is included in the Net assets in liquidation as of December 31, 2016.
 
Competition
 
The rental properties are located in St. James, Port Jefferson Station, and Cortlandt Manor, New York. The Company competes in the leasing of medical, professional and general office space and engineering, manufacturing and warehouse space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than the Company and may generally be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risk with respect to creditworthiness of tenants. Principal factors of competition in the Company’s rental property business are: the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, financial strength of its competitors, the quality and breadth of tenant services provided and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in its relevant market. Additionally, the Company’s ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends in the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. 
 
In pursuit of its business plan, and the sale of properties, the Company competes with other real estate investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, foreign investors, real estate partnerships, public and private real estate investment trusts, private individuals and other domestic real estate companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than the Company. With respect to properties presently owned by the Company, it competes with other owners of like properties for tenants. 
 
Internal Growth and Effective Asset Management
 
Tenant Relations and Lease Compliance. We strive to maintain strong contacts with our tenants in order to understand their current and future real estate rental and development needs. We directly monitor each of our rental properties to ensure they are properly maintained and meet the needs of our tenants.
 
 
11



Extending Lease Maturities. We seek to extend leases in advance of expirations to achieve high occupancy levels. Additionally, our renewal efforts focus on converting our leases to longer terms at each of our properties, to achieve a multitenant portfolio with a balanced rollover risk.
 
Financing Strategy
 
The Company believes it is currently well capitalized with adequate cash levels to operate our business and complete our strategic plan of positioning our remaining properties for sale at enhanced values and making liquidating distributions to our shareholders.
 
Special Dividends. On May 26, 2016, the Company declared a non-recurring special cash dividend on the Company’s common shares of limited liability company interests of $9.25 per share, payable June 15, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 6, 2016. The special dividend consisted of proceeds from the sale of the Fairfax Medical Center and the sale of two buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park. NASDAQ set the ex-dividend date as June 16, 2016. 
 
On August 29, 2016, the Company declared another non-recurring special cash dividend on the Company’s common shares of limited liability company interests of $1.50 per share, payable September 15, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 9, 2016. The special dividend consisted of proceeds from the sale of three additional buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park.
 
Rights Offering. On March 6, 2015, the Corporation filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for a rights offering to the Corporation’s existing shareholders. In the rights offering, the Corporation distributed, at no charge, to shareholders as of the record date non-transferable subscription rights to purchase, on a three-for-two basis, up to an aggregate of 2,224,020 shares of Gyrodyne common stock at a price of $2.75 per share.
 
The rights offering also included an over-subscription privilege, which entitled each rights holder that exercised its basic subscription privilege in full, the right to purchase additional shares of common stock that remained unsubscribed at the expiration of the rights offering, subject to the availability and pro rata allocation of shares among persons exercising this over-subscription right. The rights offering did not contain an overallotment option. 
 
On June 17, 2015, the Corporation closed the rights offering and on June 22, 2015 the Corporation announced that it received subscriptions for approximately 7,044,894 shares, greatly exceeding the maximum shares offered of 2,224,020. Shareholders were allocated 100% of their basic subscriptions. Based on the maximum 2,224,020 shares that were issued in the rights offering, 1,214,644 shares were allocated to shareholders who properly exercised their oversubscription privilege, pro rata in proportion to the aggregate number of shares subscribed for under the over-subscription privilege, or 20.12499% of each over-subscriber’s requested shares. The rights offering resulted in 2,224,020 common shares issued on June 26, 2015 and net proceeds received (after expenses) of $5,606,190 (Gross proceeds of $6,116,055 less direct expenses of the rights offering of $509,865).
 
Merger Allocations. The Merger resulted in holders of common stock of the Corporation receiving approximately 22.6% (335,086 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.0904 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per share of the Corporation’s common stock), holders of non-transferable interests in notes issued by the Corporation receiving approximately 30.0% (444,804 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.024798 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per $1.00 principal amount of the notes issued), and holders of non-transferable interests in GSD receiving approximately 47.4% (702,790 shares) of the common shares of Gyrodyne, LLC in the aggregate (.473999 common interest of Gyrodyne, LLC per GSD interest).

Environmental Matters
 
In connection with the conduct of our business, we may order a Phase 1 environmental report and, when necessary, a Phase 2 environmental report. Based on a review of such reports, and our ongoing review of each of our properties, as of the date of this report, we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of the properties which we believe would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations. There can be no assurance that (i) changes in law, (ii) the conduct of tenants, (iii) activities related to properties in the surrounding area, (iv) contamination through the water table due to the low elevation and immediate proximity of the industrial park to the Long Island Sound or (v) the discovery of environmental conditions the extent or severity of which were unknown, will not expose us to material liability in the future. 
 
The Company believes that each of its properties is in compliance, in all material respects, with federal, state and local regulations regarding hazardous waste and other environmental matters and is not aware of any environmental contamination at any of its properties that would require any material capital expenditure for the remediation thereof. No assurance can be given, however, that environmental regulations will not in the future have a materially adverse effect on the properties. 
 
Insurance
 
The Company carries comprehensive liability, property, terrorism and umbrella insurance coverage which includes fire, flood, earthquakes and business interruption insurance and covers all our properties. The Company annually reviews its policies with regard to both risk management and the underlying premiums and believes the policy specifications, insurance limits and deductibles are appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of the Company’s management, all its properties are adequately insured.
Major Tenants
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, pro forma rental income (excluding revenue related to assets sold on or prior to December 31, 2016) from the three largest tenants represented approximately 14%, 10% and 9% of total rental income. 
 
The three largest tenants by revenue as of December 31, 2016, consist of a state agency located in the industrial park, another tenant in the industrial park and a medical tenant in the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center. 
 
For the year ended December 31, 2015, pro forma rental income (excluding revenue related to assets sold on or prior to December 31, 2016) from the three largest tenants represented approximately 14%, 10% and 7% of total rental income. 
 
The three largest tenants by revenue as of December 31, 2015, consisted of a state agency located in the industrial park, another tenant in the industrial park and a medical tenant in the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center. 
 
The current economic challenges facing state and local budgets impacted 2 of the 3 largest tenants. One of these tenants has multiple leases, one of which was renewed with an expansion in late 2015. There can be no assurance that the remaining leases will renew for the same square footage, at favorable rates net of tenant improvements, if at all.

Disposition Activity
 
Port Jefferson Professional Park. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of five buildings (approximately 4,000 square feet each) in the Port Jefferson Professional Park as follows:

Fairfax Medical Center. On May 4th, 2016, the Company sold the Fairfax Medical Center for $14,015,000. Based on the terms of the sale, the Company has a master lease obligation to the purchaser on approximately 3,852 square feet for approximately $155,000 over the two years from the date of sale with payments due quarterly less any new leases or expansions signed by the buyer, which obligations will terminate if the financial obligation is satisfied through leases to one or more third party tenants.

Leasing Activity
 
New Leases and Renewals. During 2016, including leases on assets sold, the Company signed nine new leases comprising annual base rent of approximately $206,000, excluding tenant reimbursements, at an average rate per square foot of $17.76, which were offset by ten terminations comprising $241,000 in annual revenue, excluding tenant reimbursements at an average rate per square foot of $19.33. The net impact was a decrease in annual lease commitments and rented square footage of approximately $35,000 and approximately 1,000 square feet, respectively.

Lease Terminations/Defaults. There were four lease terminations in our medical parks comprising approximately 4,000 square feet and $146,000 in annual revenues. Additionally, our industrial park experienced six lease terminations comprising approximately 8,000 square feet and $95,000 of annual revenue. There were no defaults during 2016. 
 
Incentive Compensation Plan 
 
The Corporation had an Incentive Compensation Plan (the “ICP”), the remaining benefits of which were vested and not contingent on any future performance. Payment of the limited remaining benefit under the ICP was triggered upon the December 30, 2013 non-cash dividend distribution of $20.70 per share of interests in Gyrodyne Special Distribution LLC. At that time, the Corporation’s Board decided that the Corporation should defer the cash payment triggered under the ICP by such dividend until such time as the Company made cash distributions, so as to ensure plan participants were not paid ICP benefits prior to the time the shareholders received cash on the non-cash portion of the dividend (i.e. the GSD shares). Under such deferral and pursuant to the ICP limitation, the cumulative remaining amount payable was $233,200. As a result, based on 1,482,680 shares outstanding, for every penny per share dividend declared and paid, an ICP payment of $14,827 was to be paid until such future cumulative ICP payments reached $233,200. On June 15, 2016, the Company paid a dividend of $9.25 per share to shareholders of record on June 6, 2016. As a result, the Company made its final payment of $233,200 to the ICP participants.
 
Neither Frederick C. Braun III (the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who joined the Company in February 2013 and is expected to separate as of April 30, 2017, nor Gary Fitlin (the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and President and Chief Executive Officer as of May 1, 2017), who joined the Company in 2009, were participants in the ICP. 
 
The final remaining ICP benefits were paid in June, 2016. The allocation to ICP participants are below:
 

INCENTIVE PLAN PARTICIPANTS | Total | 
-------------------------------+-------+--------
Board of Directors1 | $ | 131,758
Chief Operating Officer | | 31,482 
Former Chief Executive Officer | | 43,142

 1 $17,490 of the $131,758 was paid to a former Director who resigned in September 2013. 
 2Approximately $25,652 of the $26,818 was paid to former employees. 
 
Retention Bonus Plan
 
As a result of the determination by the Corporation’s Board of Directors in September 2013 that it was in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders to pursue the actual disposition of the its remaining assets, the Company’s properties have been and will continue to be managed and marketed in an orderly manner designed to obtain the best value reasonably available for such assets. Accordingly, in May 2014, the Corporation’s Board of Directors approved a Retention Bonus Plan designed to recognize the nature and scope of the responsibilities related to such business plan, to reward and incent performance in connection therewith, to align the interests of directors, executives and employees with our shareholders and to retain such persons during the term of such plan. The Retention Bonus Plan provides for bonuses to directors, officers and employees determined by the date of sale and a percentage of the excess of gross sales proceeds from the sale of each property over the designated appraised value as adjusted by land development costs. 
 
The Retention Bonus Plan provides for a bonus pool that would be funded upon the sale of each of the Company’s properties with an initial amount equal to 5% of the specified appraised value of such properties (set forth in the Plan), so long as the gross selling price of the property is equal to or greater than 100% of its appraised value as designated in the bonus plan. The aggregate amount of the 2013 appraisals for the Company’s properties was utilized by the Company to help set the aggregate valuation of the real estate that was included in the non-cash dividend distributed on December 30, 2013. Additional funding of the bonus pool would occur on a property-by-property basis when the gross sales price of a property is in excess of its appraised value as follows: 10% on the first 10% of appreciation, 15% on the next 10% of appreciation and 20% on appreciation greater than 20%. Furthermore, if a specified property is sold on or before a designated date to be specified in the Retention Bonus Plan, an additional amount equal to 2% of the gross selling price of such property also would be funded into the bonus pool.

The bonus pool is distributable in the following proportions to the named participants in the bonus plan for so long as they are directors or employees of the Company: 15% for the Chairman, 50% in the aggregate for the directors other than the Chairman (10% for each of the other directors assuming five other directors on the Board) and 35% in the aggregate (the “Employee Pool”) for the Company’s executives and employees. Such share of the bonus pool is earned only upon the completion of the sale of a property at a gross selling price equal to or greater than its appraised value and is paid to the named beneficiaries of the Retention Bonus Plan or their designees within 60 days of the completion of such sale or, if later, within 60 days of receipt of any subsequent post-completion installment payment related to such sale. All allocations to individual beneficiaries of the Employee Pool shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in consultation with its President.
 
On May 24, 2016, the Company amended its Retention Bonus Plan to provide that land development costs incurred on a property since the date of the 2013 appraisal will be added to the appraised value of the property in calculating appreciation for the purpose of determining the bonus pool. The foregoing change was approved in order to better align the interests of the participants in the Retention Bonus Plan with those of the shareholders. The amendment also provides that each of the ten buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park will be treated as a “property”, so that a participant’s right to bonus payment on the sale of a Port Jefferson building will vest on, and payments to the bonus pool may be made shortly following, the closing of the sale of that building. As originally adopted, all ten buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park were treated as one property, so that a participant departing prior to the sale of all ten buildings would forfeit bonus on all ten buildings. The reason for this original designation was that, at the time of adoption, the Board of Directors believed that Gyrodyne’s entire Port Jefferson property would be sold as one block, not as individual buildings. Subsequent to adoption, the Gyrodyne Board came to believe that the sale of individual buildings would generate the greatest aggregate values and thus would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
 
The value of the real estate reported in the Statement of Net Assets as of December 31, 2016, does not include the appreciation that may result from the estimated land development costs. As a result, the value reported does not exceed the adjusted appraised value under the Retention Bonus Plan on certain properties and accordingly the Company has not included any estimated retention bonuses on the sales of such properties.
 
Payments made during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 under the Retention Bonus Plan relating to the sales of 6 buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park and the Virginia Healthcare Center were as follows:

Taxes attributable to the taxable REIT subsidiary
 
Taxes attributable to the limited partnership investment in The Grove. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has a current tax benefit of $19,749 reflecting income tax refunds due on the 2015 (year ended April 30, 2016) income tax returns of FPI. In addition, FPI recorded a deferred tax benefit of $84,908 reflecting taxes paid on income recognized for tax but not for book purposes. In the event, the Grove does not make any further distributions, the Company would expense the remaining tax basis and carryback the associated net operating loss in FPI and receive a tax refund in the amount of the deferred tax benefit.

Real Estate Sales. The Company also entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated March 30th, 2017, to sell the two buildings located at 9 Medical Drive and 5380 Nesconset Highway, respectively, in the Port Jefferson Professional Park for $2,000,000 to Teresa Rainone and Hesham Atwa, subject to an evaluation period that will expire thirty days from signing (with an optional extension period of ten days), during which time the purchaser shall have the right to terminate the agreement by written notice to GSD Port Jefferson, for any reason or no reason, in which case the purchaser will have the right to receive a refund of its $100,000 deposit. Unless so terminated, the agreement provides for a closing within five days of the expiration of the evaluation period. 
 
Real Estate Acquisition. On March 13, 2017, the Company entered a purchase and sale agreement to purchase a 1,950-square foot single-family residential dwelling located on approximately 0.3 acres in Cortlandt Manor, New York. The purchase price is $319,512. The Company was able to take advantage of a distressed sale following foreclosure action by the lender. The property which adjoins the Cortlandt Medical Center and is across the street from New York Presbyterian Hudson Valley Hospital Center, is expected to become part of the Cortlandt Manor MOD (see, “--, “Property Value Enhancement – Cortlandt Manor”, above). The property provides additional vehicular access to the site from Buttonwood Drive and State Route 202 and will provide for additional parking potential which the Company believes will further increase yield in a manner that is cost effective and should provide a significant return on investment to the shareholders.
