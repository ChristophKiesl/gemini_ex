 Overview
We are a preclinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the intravenous administration of self-amplifying RNA to transform outcomes for cancer patients. We believe that our product candidates have the potential to bring significant benefit to patients who are currently underserved by approved immuno-oncology therapies, including other viral immunotherapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Our self-amplifying RNA immunotherapy platform improves upon key characteristics of this therapeutic class to enhance systemic activity. Our approach involves encapsulating genomes of RNA viruses known to kill cancer cells within a lipid nanoparticle, or LNP, creating a selectively self-amplifying vRNA immunotherapy to be administered intravenously, or IV. We believe this approach has the potential to avoid the rapid immune clearance caused by neutralizing antibodies otherwise observed to date with IV-administered oncolytic viruses, which is thought to have limited the effectiveness of RNA viruses in the clinic. Once inside the tumor, the viral RNA genome is first amplified via transcription and then instructs tumor cells to synthesize proteins via translation that then self assemble into infectious virions, which thereafter causes an immunogenic tumor cell lysis before daughter virions infect nearby tumor cells.
Our two product candidates from our self-amplifying RNA platform are ONCR-021 and ONCR-788. ONCR-021, our lead product candidate, is an IV administered viral RNA encoding an optimized genome of Coxsackievirus 21A, or CVA21, encapsulated within an LNP. We plan to submit an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in mid-2023 to evaluate ONCR-021 in multiple indications, including non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and anaplastic thyroid cancer, both as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments. We are also developing ONCR-788, which encodes for a modified version of the Seneca Valley Virus, or SVV. Both CVA21 and SVV have extensive clinical experience and favorable safety profiles when administered IV. Following the IND submission for ONCR-021 and pending the receipt of additional financing, which is not certain at this time, we may submit an IND for ONCR-788 to enable its development in small cell lung cancer, neuroendocrine prostate and other neuroendocrine cancers, both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments. Alongside our self-amplifying RNA platform, we are also developing a proprietary LNP platform intended to efficiently deliver nucleic acids after both intramuscular and IV administration.
 Our product candidate ONCR-177 is an intratumorally, or iTu, administered viral immunotherapy based on our oncolytic HSV-1 platform, which leverages the Herpes Simplex Virus type 1, or HSV-1, a virus which has been clinically proven to effectively treat certain cancers. In November 2022, we announced our decision to discontinue our Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177. We plan to present the results of the Phase 1 clinical trial in conjunction with a medical conference in 2023. Further development product candidates from our HSV platform, including ONCR-719, an armed HSV-1 engineered for viral entry via the EGFR receptor for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, is dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing or enter into a partnership, collaboration, strategic alliance or licensing arrangement with a third party.
We plan to manufacture our product candidates at our manufacturing facility in Andover, Massachusetts. The facility is approximately 105,000 square feet, of which 41,000 square feet are specifically dedicated to processes that are compliant with good manufacturing practices, or GMP. We began process development activities at the facility in 2021 and, as of November 2022, construction was complete and the facility is currently fully operational. We have completed initial engineering batches of ONCR-021 at the facility, with additional engineering batches planned for the first half of 2023.
Our Pipeline
The status of our current product candidates from our self-amplifying RNA platform is shown in the table below. We have retained worldwide rights to all of our product candidates.
 


*Further development of ONCR-788 is contingent upon availability of future funding or entry into a strategic arrangement with a third party.

Traditional Cancer Therapy, Immunotherapy and the Need for New Options for Cancer Patients
 The treatment of certain cancers has improved markedly over the past decade. Whereas many cancer treatments were historically limited to surgical removal, cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation, recent advances target specific genetic changes in individual tumors or redirect the patient’s immune system, particularly T cells, to eliminate tumors and improve outcomes. Unfortunately, most patients are either not eligible for or do not respond to these therapies. For example, the efficacy of immune-based approaches in patients who qualify for this type of therapy is limited to around 12 percent. While these therapies have advanced the treatment of cancer for some patients, many are still underserved and therapies with improved clinical outcomes are still desperately needed.
The goal of immuno-oncology is to harness an individual’s immune system and better enable it to identify, attack and kill tumor cells and to form long-term immunologic memory against such tumors. We believe that the best way to significantly improve outcomes for cancer patients is to stimulate not only T cells, as has been the focus of approved immune checkpoint inhibitors, but also additional key immune cells within the innate and adaptive immune systems.
The immune system is generally divided into two arms, the innate and the adaptive, which are responsible for driving immediate and lasting anti-tumor responses. The innate immune system involves a diverse set of cells, including Natural-Killer, or NK, cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, all of which generate a rapid response to any foreign body, pathogen or tumor cell. The adaptive immune system is a second line of defense that is specific to a pathogen or antigen and is triggered when the innate immune system releases signals to activate and recruit cells from the adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system is composed of T cells and B cells that can form immunologic memory, activating upon reintroduction of the initial antigen or pathogen. Many of the recent advances in immuno-oncology, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have focused on improving the function of T cells, which are a key cell type within a patient’s adaptive immune system.
We see a vast opportunity for therapies that can stimulate robust anti-tumor responses by activating both the innate and adaptive immune systems that also influence both the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and systemic immune responses. We believe that virus-based immunotherapies offer this potential benefit by delivering potent immune stimulating agents to tumors, including not only T cells, but also NK cells and dendritic cells, and, to inhibit immune suppression within tumors, immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Our Focus—Unlock the Full Potential of RNA Therapeutics for Cancer
 We believe that RNA therapeutics are the most promising modality available today to activate multiple arms of the immune system and improve outcomes for cancer patients. Self-amplifying viral RNA, or vRNA, selectively infects and destroys tumor cells and leverages key cell types from the patient’s innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in a robust and durable anti-tumor response. In the process of directly killing the tumor, tumor-specific antigens and danger signaling molecules are released. These molecules recruit and activate the innate and adaptive immune responses to identify, attack and destroy tumors and to develop long-term immunity against such tumors. vRNA can also be engineered to express transgenes to further stimulate and prevent downregulation of the immune system. Self-amplifying vRNA has several properties that differentiates it from other anti-tumor therapies, which make it a particularly attractive addition to today’s anti-cancer arsenal, including the ability to:
▪Selectively kill tumor cells. Self-amplifying vRNA can be designed to selectively kill tumor cells while sparing healthy cells. Tumor cells are often more vulnerable to killing by vRNA replication than healthy cells because tumors often have diminished innate immune defenses, creating an environment conducive to RNA replication. 
 ▪Create an inflammatory state that turns cold tumors hot. Following vRNA replication and subsequent tumor cell death, the cells release tumor-specific antigens and danger signals, which activate the innate immune system and promote inflammation within the tumor microenvironment. This in turn attracts both innate and adaptive immune cells to the area. Viral and RNA-based immunotherapies have been shown in the clinic to transform so-called cold tumors with low numbers of infiltrated immune cells into hot tumors with high numbers of infiltrated immune cells, which are more likely to respond to checkpoint inhibitors. 
 ▪Cause the release and presentation of tumor-specific antigens. The breadth of antigens that are presented by vRNA immunotherapy-induced tumor cell lysis, or tumor cell death, is far greater than that of other anti-tumor vaccine approaches that rely on single antigens or small collections of neoantigens. These antigens can then be presented by the recruited innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, to cells of the adaptive immune system to stimulate highly effective antigen-specific immunity. By activating the adaptive immune response, anti-tumor T cells can then identify and attack all tumors in the body in addition to forming immunologic memory, which can provide patients with durable protective immunity. 
 ▪Express transgenes within the tumor microenvironment that encode for immunostimulatory proteins. Viral RNA can be engineered to carry transgenes into tumors where they can be expressed in high concentrations. These transgenes have the ability to encode immunostimulatory cytokines, immune checkpoint antibodies and other proteins that can further amplify anti-tumor immune responses. The ability of vRNA to deliver potent immunostimulatory factors directly to tumors with minimal systemic exposure represents a powerful method of amplifying the initial immune response by both stimulating the infiltrating immune cells and preventing their suppression in tumors, leading to improved outcomes for cancer patients. 


Our Self-Amplifying RNA Platform—A Novel Selectively Self-Amplifying RNA Strategy
Our pioneering IV-administered, self-amplifying RNA approach involves encapsulating the RNA genomes of viruses known to kill cancer cells (i.e., viral immunotherapies) in a lipid nanoparticle, or LNP, creating a vRNA/LNP immunotherapy.

This LNP delivery strategy evades the host immune response and allows for systemic distribution throughout the body to tumor sites. The LNP, which is intended to be less immunogenic than a natural viral capsid, is designed to overcome the challenges caused by neutralizing antibodies that have limited the efficacy of previous industry efforts to administer viruses intravenously to treat tumors.

Once inside the tumor cells, and as is the case with other viral immunotherapies, these genomes replicate and generate a burst of infectious virions that then spread locally and lyse adjacent tumor cells, as illustrated in Figure 1 below. In healthy cells, the innate immune system senses genomic replication, shuts down transcription, and no virions are produced.
 

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the mode of action of our self-amplifying RNA platform.
Current programs from our self-amplifying RNA platform, ONCR-021 and ONCR-788, are based on coxsackievirus A21, or CVA21, and Seneca Valley Virus, or SVV, respectively, which have both demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability in early clinical trials conducted by others when virions have been administered IV, but where the efficacy was likely limited by the subsequent development of neutralizing antibodies.
We have demonstrated proof of concept of this approach in preclinical models showing that self-amplifying RNAs based on both CVA21 and SVV, when administered IV, are able to successfully deliver an RNA viral genome to tumors leading to the production of replication competent viruses within the tumors and the inhibition of tumor growth. Product candidates to be developed from our self-amplifying RNA platform will utilize shared formulation, regulatory and manufacturing strategies, allowing us to be more efficient in the development of subsequent product candidates.
In October 2022, we published preclinical data in the journal Nature Communications highlighting the potential of our self-amplifying RNA platform as a novel approach to treating cancer by enabling repeat IV administration. The data demonstrated that delivery of RNA encoding for the genome of a replication-competent virus encapsulated within an LNP enabled selective replication, virus assembly, viral spread and lysis of tumor cells, leading to potent anti-tumor activity even in the presence of virus-neutralizing antibodies in the bloodstream. These RNA constructs were well tolerated in preclinical models and resulted in tumor-specific in situ production of oncolytic virions, broad immune cell recruitment and tumor destruction. Activity was observed across multiple cancer models, including xenografts, PDX, GEMM and syngeneic models, with survival benefit observed in an orthotopic small cell lung cancer tumor model. Overall, these constructs were well tolerated after single or multiple IV doses in both mice and non-human primates. We believe these preclinical results support the potential of this modality to safely and effectively kill tumor cells and stimulate multiple arms of the immune system to better fight cancer.


We plan to submit an IND to the FDA in mid-2023 to evaluate ONCR-021 in multiple indications, including non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma and anaplastic thyroid cancer, both as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments. Following the IND submission for ONCR-021 and pending the receipt of additional financing, which is not certain at this time, we may submit an IND for ONCR-788 to enable its development in small cell lung cancer, neuroendocrine prostate and other neuroendocrine cancers, both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments.
 Our Self-Amplifying RNA Product Candidate Selection Criteria
In May 2021, we announced the nomination of our first product candidates from our self-amplifying RNA platform, ONCR-021 and ONCR-788. We selected genomes for development for our self-amplifying RNA platform based upon two factors, as discussed below:
▪Clinical experience with these viruses. The foremost factor which drives our selection of viral genomes for our self-amplifying RNA platform has been clinical experience with these viruses demonstrating their tolerability after IV dosing in cancer patients as well as their ability to replicate in tumors. For example, both CVA21 and SVV have been well tolerated in clinical trials after IV dosing of infectious virions. Furthermore, these viruses were shown to replicate in patients’ tumors expanding on preclinical observation made for both CVA21 and SVV in animal models indicating that these viruses can lyse tumor cells. We believe these early viral immunotherapy product candidates would likely have been further advanced in the clinic if not for the emergence of neutralizing antibodies after the first one to two doses, which limit the ability of subsequently dosed virions to reach tumor sites. 
 ▪Technical feasibility. The identification of, and clinical utility of LNPs, has been driven by the need to intravenously deliver other therapeutics, typically nucleic acids such as RNA, to patients. The recent approval of patisiran, marketed as ONPATTRO® by Alnylam, provides validation that LNPs can be used to safely and effectively deliver nucleic acid therapies to patients through repeat IV administration. The synthesis of LNPs for tumor distribution requires the selection of viruses with genome sizes compatible with the loading capacity of an LNP. This has steered our selection of synthetic viruses for product development to oncolytic RNA viruses such as CVA21 and SVV. 
 ONCR-021—Our Lead Self-Amplifying RNA Immunotherapy Leveraging Synthetic CVA21
 We are developing ONCR-021, a vRNA product candidate for repeat IV administration based on CVA21. We selected CVA21 for our first vRNA program based on a number of attractive properties such as clinical safety and tolerability after IV dosing in patients, ability to replicate in solid tumors, and its inability to insert into the host chromosome, eliminating the potential of insertional mutagenesis. CVA21 is a picornavirus that has broad tumor tropism, in particular for non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, melanoma, kidney and other solid tumors. We intend to develop ONCR-021 for non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. In preclinical studies conducted by us and others, we observed that treatment with CVA21 resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition in mouse tumor models including NCI-H1299 and NCI-H2122 NSCLC cells and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells.
Coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21)
Coxsackievirus A21 is a naturally occurring RNA virus that normally causes mild upper respiratory tract infections in humans. Most studies on coxsackievirus focus on the CVA21 kuykendall strain which is currently in clinical development for NSCLC by Merck as V937 (formerly CAVATAK).

In early clinical trials, V937 was well-tolerated when dosed either iTu or IV and associated with both local and distant tumor responses. In a Phase 2 clinical trial, iTu injections of V937 in patients with late-stage melanoma demonstrated durable objective responses in 21.1% of patients. Tumor biopsies of treated patients demonstrated the presence of virions and increased infiltration of immune cells in tumors. Clinical trials of IV administered V937 found that neutralizing antibodies developed against the virus after approximately five to seven days, resulting in a limited window where repeat IV doses could potentially be delivered effectively. Even with the development of neutralizing antibodies, V937 administered IV in combination with pembrolizumab generated an overall response rate of 23% in NSCLC. In December 2022, Merck announced its plans to discontinue clinical development of V937 in solid tumors, citing a pipeline re-prioritization. We have reviewed clinical data of other intratumoral therapies under development and, based on that review, we hypothesize that iTu delivery of V937 was insufficient to generate meaningful responses in advanced, disseminated solid tumor. Based on this review and findings from our preclinical data, we believe that IV delivery of V937 was hindered by the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Our preclinical data support our hypothesis that ONCR-021 can be delivered IV, repeatedly without loss of efficacy due to neutralizing antibodies.
 

ONCR-021 preclinical data
We selected a CVA21 viral strain, referred to as ONCR-CVA21 prior to candidate nomination, that demonstrates more potent oncolytic activity in cancer cell lines than the Kuykendall strain developed by Merck as V937. In preclinical studies, IV dosing of ONCR-021 resulted in tumor shrinkage in two xenograft models of NSCLC, including in the NCI-H1299 tumor model, as shown in Figure 2 below, which provides us with preclinical validation for our ONCR-021 program.
 
Figure 2. ONCR-021 demonstrated anti-tumor activity in an NCI-H1299 NSCLC tumor model when dosed IV twice every 7 days. ONCR-021 is more active than vRNA based on Kuykendall (V937) strain, formulated in the same LNP (n=8 per group; p<0.0001 for ONCR-021 versus PBS control or Kuykendall vRNA).
Further preclinical studies of ONCR-021 demonstrated that ONCR-021 was well tolerated in hulCAM-1 transgenic mouse models and in non-human primates with no adverse pathology after single or repeat administration, including no effects on body weight, no adverse elevation of liver enzymes and no pathological findings at exposures above those required for antitumor activity. In addition, ONCR-021 exhibited minimal replication in normal tissues.
 We plan to submit an IND to the FDA in mid-2023 to evaluate ONCR-021 in multiple indications, including non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma and anaplastic thyroid cancer, both as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments.


Our Clinical Development Plan for ONCR-021
 
As shown in Figure 3, our Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-021 is being designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and initial efficacy of ONCR-021 administered alone and in combination with a yet to be determined anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in the histologies noted below. We plan to conduct dose escalation in our Phase 1 trial with ONCR-021 to determine the recommended phase 2 dose, or RP2D, in patients with NSCLC, RCC, melanoma and anaplastic thyroid cancer. Once RP2D is determined, we plan to open monotherapy expansion cohorts for each of the histologies listed below, NSCLC, clear cell RCC, melanoma, and anaplastic thyroid cancer. Subject to our observation of monotherapy activity at RP2D, we plan to confirm safety the safety profile of ONCR-021 at RP2D in combination with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor. Upon confirmation of safety, we plan to launch expansion cohorts of ONCR-021 in combination with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in frontline NSCLC and frontline melanoma. Subject to observations of safety, tolerability and efficacy in Phase 1 escalation and expansion cohorts, there is potential for accelerated approval and orphan drug designation in anaplastic thyroid cancer.

ONCR-788—Self-Amplifying RNA Leveraging SVV
 
In addition to ONCR-021, we are also developing ONCR-788 based on the Seneca Valley Virus RNA genome, or SVV. Following the IND submission for ONCR-021 and pending further financing, which is not certain at this time, we may submit an IND for ONCR-788 to enable its development in small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, neuroendocrine prostate and other neuroendocrine cancers, both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other cancer treatments.
 We selected the SVV genome based on a number of attractive properties such as clinical safety and tolerability after IV dosing in patients, ability to replicate solid tumors, and its inability to insert into the host chromosome, eliminating the potential of insertional mutagenesis. SVV is a picornavirus that has tropism for several human tumor cell lines, in particular those with neuroendocrine features. Cancers with neuroendocrine features include SCLC and treatment-emergent small-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer, or t-NEPC. In preclinical studies led by others, SVV was shown to result in complete and durable eradication of tumors in multiple mouse tumor models including NCI-H446 cells, and in a mouse model of medulloblastoma, SVV was shown to lead to increases in long term survival.
Past attempts by others at developing an SVV monotherapy as a treatment for cancer have been shown to demonstrate increases in viral titers as well as no dose limiting toxicities in patients treated with low doses of SVV. In these Phase 1 and 2 trials conducted by others, there was also evidence of selective viral replication in tumor tissue but not adjacent healthy tissue. These observations are consistent with what we believe is the ability of SVV to specifically target and replicate in tumor cells and to be well-tolerated after IV dosing. In these trials, patients who received SVV also developed neutralizing antibodies, resulting in rapid clearance of SVV from circulation, limiting the ability to deliver repeat doses effectively, which we believe has hampered the therapeutic potential of prior SVV candidates.

ONCR-788 preclinical data
In a preclinical study, an LNP-encapsulated SVV genome was administered IV in a mouse NCI-H446 model of human SCLC. As shown in Figure 4 below, we observed a significant reduction in tumor growth as compared to PBS and, as shown in Figure 5, the presence of neutralizing antibodies did not have a significant effect on the observed reduction in tumor growth.
 

Figure 4. ONCR-788 led to tumor growth inhibition in the NCI-H446 SCLC tumor model when dosed IV twice every 7 days (n=8 per group; p< 0.0001 ONCR-788 versus PBS).

Figure 5. Efficacy of ONCR-788 is not inhibited by SVV neutralizing antibodies. ONCR-788 leads to tumor growth inhibition in the NCI-H446 SCLC model when dosed IV in presence of either control or neutralizing SVV antibodies (Ab). By contrast, the efficacy of SVV virions dosed IV is inhibited by SVV neutralizing antibodies (n= 10 per group, p<0.0001 for Synthetic SVV + control Ab, Synthetic SVV + neutralizing Ab and SVV + control Ab vs. PBS or SVV + neutralizing Ab).

After IV dosing our LNP-encapsulated RNA genome, we examined multiple tissues from treated animals for the presence of negative-strand SVV RNA to assess the replication of our synthetic SVV in these tissues. Testing for the presence of negative-strand SVV RNA is a sensitive way of assessing the replication of ONCR-788, which is based on the fact that SVV is a positive-strand RNA virus that requires a negative-strand RNA as a replication intermediate. As illustrated in Figure 6 below, we found negative-strand RNA only in tumor tissue and not in the liver, demonstrating that RNA genomes were delivered to the tumor cells and resulted in the generation of fully infectious virions within the tumor, but did not replicate in tissues outside the tumor.
 Detection of SVV Replicating Genomes

Figure 6. Replicative SVV intermediates, negative-strand RNA, are found in the tumors but not in liver. Each histogram represents a dosed animal. Neg = non-replicating vRNA control; OCR-788 = replicating SVV vRNA; cDNA = complementary DNA; (-)ssRNA = negative single strand RNA.
We believe that the ability of SVV to target neuroendocrine tumors as a monotherapy, as well as the potential for adding benefit in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy, could allow us to bring therapeutic benefit to patients for whom there are limited treatment options.
Our HSV Platform
 We designed our HSV platform, including product candidates ONCR-177 and ONCR-719, to overcome the limitations in potency and in the ability to stimulate anti-tumor immunity that have both been encountered by previous viral immunotherapies and other immuno-oncology therapies. Therapies derived from this platform have the potential to address multiple types of tumors, including our ONCR-719 program designed to target brain cancer. Further development of ONCR-719 is dependent on a strategic partnership or additional financing.
Our Discontinued Phase 1 Clinical Trial of ONCR-177
 In June 2020, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177 in patients with several different types of solid tumors, including breast cancers and cutaneous tumors. We presented our preliminary findings from the Phase 1 clinical trial in November 2021 via a poster presentation at the 36th Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, or SITC. The presentation included data from 14 patients in the fully enrolled and completed dose escalation cohorts of the trial and five patients enrolled in the dose expansion monotherapy portion of the trial. In the fully enrolled and completed surface lesion dose escalation portion of the trial, we reported that ONCR-177, when administered to heavily pretreated patients with advanced, injectable solid tumors, was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities as of the data cutoff date of November 8, 2021. No treatment-related adverse events exceeded Grade 2, and the most common Grade 1 and 2 adverse events were fatigue, chills, nausea, and mild, dose-dependent cytokine release syndrome, or CRS. No infectious virions were detected in skin swabs, consistent with our expectations with respect to ONCR-177's safety profile. As of November 8, 2021, after four weeks of monotherapy treatment with ONCR-177 at the recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, of 4x108 PFU in 4 mL (receiving two doses of ONCR-177), three of eight evaluable patients (one with cutaneous melanoma, one with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or SCCHN, and one with mucosal melanoma) had demonstrated clinical benefit. These consisted of one partial response in the patient with cutaneous melanoma as measured by calipers per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST; one investigator-reported clinical response in the SCCHN patient in their injected lymph node; and one reported stable disease in the patient with mucosal melanoma as measured by RECIST 1.1 with additional improvement in cancer-related symptoms. Several findings from this trial suggested immune stimulation of the tumor microenvironment following administration of ONCR-177, including mild, dose-dependent CRS in association with increased interferon-gamma (IFNγ) and T-cell proliferation in blood, as well evidence of tumor PD-L1 expression and immune cell infiltration.

We later initiated enrollment in the surface lesion dose combination expansion portion of the clinical trial. Patients in this portion of the trial received ONCR-177 in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor. In addition, we enrolled and dosed separate cohorts of patients with visceral tumors in the liver with the goal of showing additional safety data.
On November 30, 2022, we announced our plans to discontinue the Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177 and our decision to reprioritize our product pipeline to focus on the development of our lead self-amplifying vRNA immunotherapy product candidate, ONCR-021. We plan to present the final results of the Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177 in conjunction with a medical conference in 2023.
ONCR-719—Our HSV Immunotherapy Candidate for GBM
 Leveraging the knowledge and experience gained through the development of ONCR-177, we also have additional preclinical stage programs within our HSV platform addressing both iTu and IV solutions to other unmet medical needs, including ONCR-719, our program designed to target GBM through iTu injection.
 In November 2022, we announced the presentation of preclinical data for ONCR-719 in a poster at the 2022 Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) Annual Meeting alongside an update regarding product candidate selection criteria. ONCR-719 is a novel, armed oncolytic HSV-1 vector product candidate engineered with targeted entry via EGFR/EGFRvIII and expresses four immunomodulatory payloads designed to reverse GBM’s immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In addition, ONCR-719 is derived from a potent HSV-1 isolate to drive oncolysis, is engineered with fusogenic mutations to enhance viral spread, and uses our clinically validated microRNA attenuation strategy to inhibit viral replication in healthy cells. We leveraged our knowledge of mRNA expression to engineer an attenuation strategy designed to protect healthy brain tissue and select a combination of payloads that address the specific drivers of immune suppression in brain cancer.
Highlights from the preclinical poster presented at the 2022 SNO Annual Meeting describing ONCR-719 include:
 •Minimal expression of HSV-1 virus entry receptor, NECTIN-1, on human GBM samples suggests targeted oncolytic viruses are required to effectively treat human GBM tumors.
 •ONCR-719 has been engineered to enter tumor cells using either EGFR/EGFRvIII or NECTIN-1 as an entry receptor, thereby increasing virus tropism for GBM tumors.
 •EGFR-targeting and engineered fusogenic mutations in ONCR-719 enhance virus spread and tumor immunogenicity by driving syncytia formation in human GBM tumor cell lines.
 •ONCR-719 is engineered to include IL-12, an anti-PD-1 nanobody, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, or HPGD, and a novel macrophage modulating-Fc enhanced antibody. These payloads confer enhanced T cell recruitment and activation and target the immune suppressive macrophages and myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. Multiple payloads or transgenes were screened using in vivo orthotopic GBM models to identify immune-modulatory payloads to target the GBM microenvironment.
 •Together, EGFR/EGFRvIII targeting, oncolytic potency, and incorporation of rationally designed payloads within ONCR-719 leads to enhanced anti-tumor activity in preclinical orthotopic GBM models.
 •ONCR-719 is engineered for safety in the central nervous system using multiple CNS-specific microRNA targets our platform technology, which we believe will engineer product candidates to successfully limit viral replication in healthy cells in the clinic. When ONCR-719 was injected intracranially in an HSV-1 sensitive mouse, ONCR-719 demonstrated a greater than 50,000-fold tolerability window compared to the unattenuated strain.
 ONCR-719 is specifically designed to treat GBM, the most frequent and aggressive form of brain cancer. GBM, with its typically poor prognosis, represents a particularly acute unmet medical need. In the United States, it is estimated that there are approximately 18,000 newly diagnosed patients each year and 13,000 deaths annually. Newly diagnosed high-grade patients have a median overall survival of 15 to 17 months; the 5-year-overall survival rate is only 5.6%. For patients in which disease recurred the prognosis is much worse, with a median overall survival of 6 to 8 months, while in patients who failed treatment with temozolomide and bevacizumab, or equivalent salvage chemotherapy, overall survival is reported being as short as 3 to 4 months. The current FDA-approved therapies bevacizumab, carmustine wafer, NovoTTF-100A, and lomustine are only marginally effective in extending overall survival in patients with recurrent GBM. The initial results from other companies’ clinical trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 antibodies have not shown positive outcomes in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas.
Our further development of ONCR-719 is dependent on our ability to obtain a strategic partner for the program or upon receipt of additional financing to support its development.


Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary rights. We compete in the highly competitive markets that address cancer and face significant competition from many sources, including pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and private and public research institutions. Any RNA-based therapeutics that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We are focused on developing next-generation RNA therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.
We are aware of other companies either marketing or focused on developing competing therapies for the treatment of cancer which generally fall into the following treatment groups:
▪oncolytic viral immunotherapies, including Daiichi Sankyo's DELYTACT, which is approved in Japan for treating malignant glioma;
 ▪other oncolytic viruses that are currently in development by companies such as Replimune, AstraZeneca, Chugai Pharmaceutical, Astellas, Candel Therapeutics, Transgene SA, HOOKIPA Pharma, and Seneca Therapeutics; 
 ▪approved immunotherapy antibodies and immunotherapy agents in clinical development, including antibody agents, bispecific T cell engagers, including those in development by Amgen, and immuno-oncology companies focused on cytokines and checkpoint inhibitors, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co., Roche, Regeneron, Werewolf Therapeutics, and Asher Bio; 
 ▪cancer vaccines, including personalized vaccines and those targeting tumor neoantigens, including neoantigen therapies in development by companies such as BioNTech, Gritstone Oncology, Merck & Co., and Moderna Therapeutics; 
 ▪RNA-based therapeutics, including self-amplifying or self-replicating RNA, including those that encode immune stimulants, immune modulators, or target resistance genes, in development by companies such as Moderna Therapeutics, Strand Therapeutics, CureVac, Replicate Bioscience, and Kernal Biologics.
 ▪cell-based therapies, including CAR T cell therapies, T cell receptor and NK cell therapies; and 
 ▪traditional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, surgery, radiation and targeted therapies. 
 Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, may have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, are easier to administer or are less expensive alone or in combination with other therapies than any products that we may develop alone or in combination with other therapies, especially if these get to market sooner than our products. These and other third parties also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.
Competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Our viral immunotherapy product candidates, if and when marketed, will compete with a number of therapies that are currently marketed or in development that also target cancer but that utilize different mechanisms of action. To compete effectively with these agents, our product candidates will need to demonstrate advantages that lead to improved clinical efficacy and safety compared with these competitive agents. While we believe that our current and future product candidates have the potential to provide potent clinical antitumor activity as monotherapies, we also plan to test them in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy agents. As such, if and when ultimately marketed, our product candidates may be in combination with checkpoint therapies in addition to other existing cancer therapies, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and other biological therapies such as antibodies targeting particular surface receptors. We, therefore, believe that our product candidates, if and when marketed, may in some instances complement rather than compete directly with these existing treatment options.
We expect to face direct and increasing competition from a number of companies that are also seeking to develop cancer therapies based on viral immunotherapies and other ways to stimulate the immune system. We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend, among other things, on our ability to:
▪expeditiously advance the development of our product candidates; 
 ▪design, enroll patients in and successfully complete appropriate clinical trials in a timely fashion; 
 ▪gain regulatory approval for our product candidates in their first indications as well as further indications; 


▪establish collaborations and partnerships for the development and marketing of our product candidates; 
 ▪commercialize our product candidates successfully, including convincing physicians, insurers and third-party payors of the safety and efficacy of our product candidates over currently approved therapies; 
 ▪secure and protect intellectual property rights based on our innovations; and 
 ▪manufacture or otherwise obtain and sell commercial quantities of future products to the market. 
 Manufacturing
We continue to invest in our internal development capabilities to establish in-house manufacturing expertise to support our pipeline. We expect to continue to invest to build proprietary processes that will enable us to be at a competitive advantage when manufacturing product candidates from our self-amplifying RNA platform programs, and expect that our product candidates and their components from our self-amplifying RNA platform will be manufactured in-house with minimal reliance on third-party CMOs. We intend to continue to rely on third party CMOs from time to time while establishing our own cGMP manufacturing facilities and thereafter for the production of cGMP-grade material in order to secure our supply chain for future production needs.
In December 2020, we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 88,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space in Andover, Massachusetts to support our advancing pipeline of product candidates. In November 2021, we entered into an amendment to our lease to increase the existing footprint of the facility to a total of approximately 105,000 square feet, 41,000 square feet of which is specifically dedicated to GMP compliant processes. We began process development activities at the facility in 2021 and, as of November 2022, construction was complete and the facility is currently fully operational. We have completed initial engineering batches of ONCR-021 at the facility, with additional engineering batches planned for the first half of 2023.
 With respect to our discontinued Phase 1 clinical trial of ONCR-177, we transferred our processes to commercial CMOs based in the United States for production, labeling, packaging and distribution of our initial batches of clinical material. Through the development of ONCR-177 prior to November 2022, we focused on developing a full-scale manufacturing process intended to optimize production of clinical grade material through a closed, serum-free process.
We require that our CMOs produce drug substance and finished drug product in accordance with cGMPs and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates. We do not have long-term supply arrangements in place with our CMOs.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in our field and other fields that are or may be important for the development of our business. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and our product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
As of February 21, 2023, our patent portfolio consisted of 17 issued U.S. patents, 21 pending U.S. patent applications, and 35 issued foreign patents and approximately 151 pending foreign applications. These patents and patent applications include claims related to our platforms, products, methods, manufacturing processes, and potential future products and developments, with expected expiry dates not earlier than between 2026 and 2043.
Self-Amplifying RNA Platform
As of February 21, 2023, our patent portfolio related to our self-amplifying RNA platform includes twelve patent families, which relate generally to synthetic virus compositions and methods of use in the treatment of various cancers.
We solely own these twelve patent families. Four families currently have applications pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa. One family has application pending in the United States. Three families have pending PCT applications that will enter national stages between July 2023 and June 2024. These applications cover the compositions related to polynucleotides, expression of therapeutic payloads, nanoparticle formulations and dosage, bispecific payload molecules, diagnostic biomarkers and methods related to their manufacturing and use. We intend to file national phase applications in multiple jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, Asia, and Central and South America. Any patents that may issue from these pending applications are expected to expire between 2039 and 2043, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.

HSV Platform
As of February 21, 2023, our patent portfolio related to our HSV platform includes 13 owned or licensed patent families, which relate generally to the composition of our current and potential future products, and their methods of use.
We solely own six patent families, which include four issued U.S. patents, eight issued foreign patents, five pending U.S. patent applications, and pending foreign counterparts in Europe, Asia, Oceania, South Africa, Canada, and Central and South America. Two issued U.S. patents, which expire on January 27, 2037, include claims directed at particular microRNA-attenuated HSV vectors, expression of certain therapeutic payloads, and their methods of use in the treatment of cancer. The other two issued U.S. patents, which expire on June 30, 2037, include claims directed at HSV vectors comprising particular combinations of certain therapeutic payloads. The pending applications include additional claims for microRNA-attenuated HSV vectors including the HSV vector utilized in our HSV based product candidates, HSV vectors encoding particular therapeutic payloads, and their methods of use in the treatment of cancer. Patent applications are pending in these families in more than 17 jurisdictions worldwide, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan. Any patents that may issue from these pending applications are expected to expire between 2037 and 2042, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
We have exclusively licensed from the University of Pittsburgh rights in three patent families related to HSV platform vectors, including certain glycoprotein modifications, a deletion of repeated HSV genes, certain micro-RNA-attenuated HSV vectors, and expression of certain therapeutic proteins from HSV vectors, and their methods of use. These patent families include eight issued U.S. patents, 17 issued patents in jurisdictions including Australia, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa, two pending U.S. patent applications and 16 pending foreign applications pending in various jurisdictions worldwide, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore. Patents in these families are expected to expire between 2031 and 2037, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We have also exclusively licensed from Ospedale San Raffaele S.r.l. and Fondazione Telethon rights in one patent family related to micro-RNA attenuation of therapeutic payloads. This family includes six issued patents and seven pending applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2026, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We have exclusively licensed from Northwestern University rights in one patent family related to mutations in the UL37 HSV gene. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2036, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We have also exclusively licensed from WuXi Biologics Ireland Limited rights in one patent family related to novel PD-1 antagonist sequences. This family includes one Chinese patent and seven pending applications in the United States, China, Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Europe and Japan. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Finally, we have also exclusively licensed from Gaeta Therapeutics Ltd. rights in one patent family related to local delivery or expression of IL-12 with a systemic checkpoint inhibitor. This family includes six issued patents and six pending applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Patents in this family are expected to expire in 2032, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
In November 2022, we began taking steps to align our patent portfolio with our re-focused research and development efforts outlined above. This included reducing the number of pending cases in certain of our HSV-related patent families. For example, we have allowed pending cases that claim priority to PCT/US2017/040354 to lapse in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, and South Africa, pending cases that claim priority to PCT/US2018/043938 to lapse in Australia, Brazil, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Africa, and pending cases that claim priority to PCT/US2018/067922 to lapse in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Furthermore, we are undergoing discussions with University of Pittsburg to allow pending cases that claim priority to PCT/US2014/062676 to lapse in Brazil, China, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, and Singapore.
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and,

in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our product candidates or processes, obtain licenses, or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future product candidates may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to March 16, 2013 in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO, to determine priority of invention.

Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement with MSD International GmbH
In July 2020, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement, or the MSD Agreement, with MSD International GmbH, an affiliate of Merck & Co., Inc. (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada), to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ONCR-177 combined with Merck’s cancer immunotherapy KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), a humanized anti-human PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in our Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with solid tumors. The MSD Agreement provides that we conduct the trial at our own cost with MSD contributing its compound for use in the clinical trial without financial obligation to us, except that we may be required to reimburse MSD for the cost of its compound upon certain early termination events. The parties equally own the clinical data and inventions arising from the combination study, with the exception of inventions relating solely to each party’s compound class. The MSD Agreement will expire upon the delivery of a written report on the results of the study, unless earlier terminated or agreed by the parties.
Each party has the right to terminate the MSD Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. In addition, each party may terminate the agreement upon its own good faith determination that the study may unreasonably affect patient safety or that termination is required for medical, scientific, legal or regulatory reasons, or if an applicable regulatory authority takes any action that prevents the supply of its respective compound for use in the trial. In addition, MSD may terminate the agreement and its supply of KEYTRUDA if MSD believes in good faith that its compound is being used in an unsafe manner in the trial and we fail to promptly incorporate any requested changes into the trial protocol.
Gaeta Agreement
 In November 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Gaeta Therapeutics Ltd., or Gaeta, pursuant to which Gaeta has granted us an exclusive, worldwide sublicense under certain patent rights related to the local delivery or expression of IL-12 with a systemic checkpoint inhibitor to make and have made, use, have used, sell, offer for sale, export and import any products we develop that would otherwise infringe upon such patent rights when administered in combination with a checkpoint blockade agent in the field of oncolytic viral therapy. Gaeta is the licensee of these patent rights under a separate license agreement with the University of Zurich, or UZH, pursuant to which Gaeta is entitled to sublicense the patent rights and has agreed not to enter into (and to ensure that UZH not enter into) any further sublicense with respect to the patent rights in the field.
 In connection with our entry into the license agreement with Gaeta, we paid Gaeta an up-front fee of $0.2 million. We are obligated to make certain additional milestone payments to Gaeta, including a low six-figure payment related to the achievement of a certain patent-related milestone in the United States, and certain clinical and regulatory milestone payments on a product-by-product and indication-by-indication basis, which milestone payments amount to $7.5 million in the aggregate for a given product or indication, with an additional annual payment in the low single-digit millions following regulatory approval of each product. We are also obligated to pay tiered royalties on cumulative net sales of all products ranging from the low to mid single-digit millions, up to $2.5 million in the aggregate for cumulative net sales in excess of a mid nine-digit threshold with additional payments in the mid single-digit millions thereafter upon the achievement of additional net sales milestones.
The license agreement with Gaeta will terminate upon the last to expire of any patent included in the applicable patent rights. Additionally, Gaeta may terminate the agreement for cause upon written notice to us if (i) we directly or indirectly oppose or dispute the grant of letters patent or any patent application within the patent rights, (ii) we are in material breach of the license agreement with Gaeta and fail to remedy such breach within sixty days of Gaeta providing notice thereof in writing, or (iii) we are deemed bankrupt or insolvent or become subject to similar proceedings. We may terminate the license agreement with Gaeta with or without cause upon sixty days’ prior written notice to Gaeta. In the event that UZH terminates the head license with Gaeta, we have the right to become a direct licensee of UZH with substantially the same rights and obligations as it is entitled to under the license agreement with Gaeta, subject to certain qualifications.
 NOF Agreement
 In October 2022, we entered into a license agreement with NOF Corporation, or NOF. Under the license agreement with NOF, or the NOF Agreement, we obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide (except with respect to China and other specified territories in Asia), sublicensable (subject to certain limitations) license from NOF under certain patent claims of NOF relating to NOF’s cationic lipid, or NOF Lipid, to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products made of or from NOF Lipid and a nucleic acid, or Oncorus Products, including ONCR-021. The NOF Lipid is one of multiple lipids that comprise the proprietary LNP associated with ONCR-021. NOF will supply the NOF Lipid to be used for the development, manufacture and commercialization of Oncorus Products pursuant to a supply agreement to be negotiated and entered into by the parties.

The NOF Agreement provides for an initial license payment of $0.5 million, which was paid to NOF upon signing, and we may be obligated to make milestone payments to NOF of up to approximately $25 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones. In the event that more than one Oncorus Product achieves such milestones, or if an Oncorus Product achieves the specified milestones for additional indications, we will be obligated to make additional milestone payments between approximately $5 million and approximately $10 million for each such additional product and/or indication. We are also obligated to pay NOF royalties on net sales of Oncorus Products at a percentage in the low single digits, subject to standard reductions. The obligation to pay royalties under the NOF Agreement commences on the first commercial sale of the first Oncorus Product anywhere in the licensed territory, and expires on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis after a specified number of years following the first commercial sale of the first Oncorus Product anywhere in the licensed territory, or if later, the date upon which no licensed patent claim validly exists in such jurisdiction.
The NOF Agreement expires upon expiration of all royalty obligations. We may terminate the NOF Agreement for convenience upon prior written notice to NOF. NOF may terminate the NOF Agreement if we fail to pay any undisputed amount due under the NOF Agreement, or if NOF reasonably determines that we have not been engaged in any material activities for the development, manufacture or commercialization of any Oncorus Product for a specified period of time. Additionally, either party may terminate the NOF Agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other party, in the event of the other party’s insolvency, or if all clinical trials for the Oncorus Products in all jurisdictions in the licensed territory fail and/or all applications for regulatory approvals in all jurisdictions in the licensed territory are rejected, and it is reasonably determined that there is no possibility of further clinical trials or applications for regulatory approvals in any jurisdiction in the licensed territory being successful.
 Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologic products. Clearance from the FDA is required before conducting human clinical testing of biologic products. FDA licensure also must be obtained before marketing of biologic products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Biologic Products Development Process
Any biologic product must be licensed by the FDA before it may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
▪completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
 ▪submission to the FDA of an application for an IND exemption, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless FDA objects within 30 days; 
 ▪approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
 ▪performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s GCP regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use; 
 ▪preparation and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 ▪review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; 
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity; 
 ▪potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
 ▪payment of user fees and FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. 
 Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
Human Clinical Trials Under an IND
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent.
Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the study protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
▪Phase 1. The biologic product candidate initially is introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early understanding of its effectiveness. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 ▪Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 ▪Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as “pivotal” studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a biologic product. In Phase 3 studies, the biologic product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the potency and safety of the product for approval. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA.

Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for: serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other trials, in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Compliance with cGMP Requirements
Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. The FDA will not approve a BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specification.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. The PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics and an annual establishment license fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews a BLA within 60 days of submission to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In that event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth, substantive review of the BLA.
The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biologic products or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product candidate. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product,

seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements.
On the basis of the BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biologic product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of BLAs under the PDUFA. One such goal is to review standard BLAs in ten months after the FDA accepts the BLA for filing, and priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Post-approval Requirements
Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA, together with a release protocol, showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biologic products.
A sponsor also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”). The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Violations relating to the promotion of off-label uses may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, as well as state consumer protection laws. Companies, however, may generally share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of a clinical trial by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare providers, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. Moreover, a given patent may only be extended once based on a single product. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and use of pharmaceutical products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors, existing or potential customers and referral sources, including healthcare providers, are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, and these laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which manufacturers conduct clinical research, market, sell and distribute the products for which they obtain marketing approval. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:
▪the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and other individuals and entities on the other. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation; 
 ▪the federal civil and criminal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act, or the FCA, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, also may implicate the FCA. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA;
 ▪the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or the CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare providers (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 
 ▪the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability, among other things, for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 


▪HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the transmission, security and privacy of protected health information by entities subject to HIPAA, such as health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, and their respective business associates and their covered subcontractors that access protected health information; and 
 ▪state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers and drug pricing and/or marketing expenditures; and state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Violation of the laws described above or any other governmental laws and regulations may result in significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, imprisonment, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if a person becomes subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Furthermore, efforts to ensure that business activities and business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can be costly for manufacturers of branded prescription products.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States, sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval for commercial sale is obtained will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities and health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.
A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. New metrics frequently are used as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, it may be necessary to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
Health Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
By way of example, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the healthcare industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our business are:
▪an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 
 ▪an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively; 
 ▪a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 ▪extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 
 ▪expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability; 
 ▪a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 
 ▪expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and 
 ▪a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. 
 Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. As a result, there have been delays in the implementation of, and action taken to repeal or replace, certain aspects of the ACA. For example, former President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, effective January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees. In addition, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the "donut hole" under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025

by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect until 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 There also has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. Further, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Additionally, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level, individual states in the United States have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
We expect that these initiatives, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other countries that impose similar obligations.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business abroad or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign government official, government staff member, official or employee of a public international organization, or a political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with healthcare professionals of foreign state-owned or affiliated hospitals, universities, or research institutions. Equivalent laws have been adopted in other foreign countries that impose similar obligations.
Employees and Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 64 full-time employees. Of these 64 employees, 50 employees were engaged in research and development. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants.
