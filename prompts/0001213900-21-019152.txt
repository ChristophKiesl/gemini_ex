Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
We are a provider of next generation digital payment solutions and services to businesses and consumers. Our business model has substantially changed during the course of 2020. We have focused on developing a technology driven digital infrastructure via IPSIPay Platform and IPSIPay applications and have plans to launch various digital payment cryptocurrency products, including, IPSI Pay, IPSI Stable Coin, IPSI Wallet and IPSI Payroll, using blockchain technology. We are developing a flexible ecosystem that will enable businesses and customers to adopt and utilize IPSIPay prepaid card services, integrated payment service solutions in US and Mexico, money transfer to and from US swiftly at minimal cost compared to traditional money transfer service providers, utilizing stable dollar backed coins thus allowing small businesses and consumers to have access to various payment routes previously not available to them. We also intend to use our kiosk payment system and service in US. 
 
Our initial introduction into virtual payment services was launched in the Mexican market in the third quarter of 2014 where we had an integrated a network of kiosks, terminals and payment channels that enabled consumers to deposit cash, convert it into digital form and remit the funds to any merchant in our network swiftly and securely. We helped consumers and merchants connect more efficiently in markets and consumer segments that are largely cash-based and lack convenient alternatives to pay for services in physical, online or mobile environment.
 
On August 5, 2019, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with Vivi Holdings to sell to Vivi Holdings, our Mexican operations for 2,250,000 shares of common stock of Vivi Holdings (the “Stock Sale”), of which nine percent (9%) was allocated to the following: Gaston Pereira (5%), Andrey Novikov (2.5%), and Joseph Abrams (1.5%). The sale of the Mexican operations pursuant to the SPA was closed on December 31, 2019 after the receipt of a final fairness opinion and the approval of our shareholders. We no longer have any business operations in Mexico and our business is now focused on our U.S. operations based in Calabasas, California.

 
Our Strategy
 
We offer a simple payment solution for consumers and businesses. We have plans to roll out 50 kiosks in Southern California to provide digital payments for the unbanked and underbanked using self-service kiosks and an E wallet ecosystem. The kiosks are currently located in our warehouses in Southern California awaiting re-engineering and installation. Due to measures imposed by the local governments in areas affected by COVID-19, businesses have been suspended due to quarantine intended to contain this outbreak and many people have been forced to work from home in those areas. As a result, installation of our network of kiosks, terminals and payment channels in Southern California has been delayed, which has had an adverse impact on our business and financial condition and has hampered our ability to generate revenue and access usual sources of liquidity on reasonable terms. During this delay, we decided to take reengineer our kiosks to provide for additional functionality and features.
 
Our mission is to leverage our four-years of experience that we had with our Mexican kiosks and build out a US only kiosk network in Southern California that will allow the majority of the Southern California market to transfer money to Mexico at a lower cost than their current options and make payments to Mexican vendors as well.
 
The launch of the kiosks in Southern California will be directed toward the heavily trafficked Mexican grocery stores, convenience stores, check cashing businesses, and gas stations. Our goal is to develop a distribution network of kiosks that allow our clients to enhance their customer experience by combining mobile and hardware interfaces, such as IPSI Wallet, our mobile wallet under development, coupled with self-service kiosks into a seamless customer centric ecosystem.

Business Model
 
Our primary source of revenue is expected to come from commissions and fees from money transfers. We also expect to derive revenue from a second screen on the kiosks which will be an ad driven revenue producer. Over the last 4 years we established the model, with over $11,000,000 in revenue last year and 2 million Mexican subscribers using the kiosks regularly. This experience and the vending partnerships established in those machines should facilitate the roll-out of our company owned machines in Southern California. This coupled with US vending additions such as micro loans, money transmitting opportunities (a $30 Billion business), lotto tickets, and the built- in Mexican vendors, gives us what we believe to be the total solution for the Mexican consumer population in Southern California. After the launch of the 50 kiosks in a small, designated Los Angeles area, we anticipate having a sophisticated distribution network of over 500 kiosks in California, Texas and Florida. With this initial launch in Southern California, we will own the first 50 machines and the retailer will receive 20% of the fees as rent. Alternatively, we may sell the kiosks to retailers for a unit price of $6,000 and in return receive 30% of the revenues.
Distribution Network
 
We are developing a distribution network along several verticals; 1) An agent network of independent businesses with high customer traffic in which our kiosks will be deployed generating additional revenue for them; and 2) Retailers that wish to decongest long lines and shift service payments to self-service kiosks.
Marketing
 
We participate in special local events and exhibitions and provide promo materials to distribute to retailers. We intend to direct advertisements to the mainly Spanish speaking customers in Southern California, along with our Spanish speaking employees that can educate and demonstrate services at the kiosks. We expect this will add tremendously to acceptance and word of mouth advertising in the respective neighborhoods.
Competition
 
The payment service business is highly competitive and continued growth depends on our ability to compete effectively. Although we don’t face direct competition in the form of kiosks, companies like Western Union, Money Gram, Wells Fargo, dominate the money remittance, wiring business. However, with the E wallet, our customer has the ability to deposit money into the kiosks and consequently creating their own digital wallet bank on our network.
Government and Environmental Regulation and Laws
 
Currently our business is not impacted by government regulation. We may in the future be subject to a variety of regulations aimed at preventing money laundering and financing criminal activity and terrorism, financial services regulations, payment services regulations, consumer protection laws, currency control regulations, advertising laws and privacy and data protection laws and therefore expect to experience periodic investigations by various regulatory authorities in connection with the same, which may sometimes result in monetary or other sanctions being imposed on us. Many of these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and are often unclear and inconsistent with other applicable laws and regulations, making compliance challenging and increasing our related operating costs and legal risks. In particular, there has been increased public attention and heightened legislation and regulations regarding money laundering and terrorist financing. We may have to make significant judgment calls in applying anti-money laundering legislation and risk being found in non-compliance with such laws.
 
The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, utility tokens, security tokens and offerings of digital assets is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect our development and the value. Regulation of digital assets, like IPSI Stable Coin, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency exchanges, is currently undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve as government agencies take greater interest in them. Regulation also varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future adopt laws, regulations, or guidance, or take other actions, which may severely impact the permissibility of tokens generally and the technology behind them or the means of transaction or in transferring them. In addition, any violations of laws and regulations relating to the safeguarding of private information in connection with IPSI Stable Coin IPSI Pay, IPSI Payroll and/or IPSI Wallet could subject us to fines, penalties or other regulatory actions, as well as to civil actions by affected parties. Any such violations could adversely affect the ability of the Company to maintain IPSI Stable Coin, IPSI Stable Coin IPSI Pay, IPSI Payroll and/or IPSI Wallet, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Failure by us to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.

Our Corporate History and Background
 
We were incorporated on September 25, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada originally under the name Asiya Pearls, Inc. On May 27, 2016, Asiya Pearls, Inc. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from Asiya Pearls, Inc. to QPAGOS.
 
Qpagos Corporation was incorporated on May 1, 2015 under the laws of Delaware under the name Qpagos Corporation as the holding company for its two 99.9% owned operating subsidiaries, QPagos, S.A.P.I. de C.V. “Qpagos Mexico”) and Redpag Electrónicos S.A.P.I. de C.V. (“Redpag”). Each of these entities were incorporated in November 2013 in Mexico. Qpagos Mexico was formed to process payment transactions for service providers it contracts with as well as provide electronic payment solutions to multiple clients in several industry segments including retail, financial transportation, and government; and Redpag was formed to deploy and operate kiosks as a distributor of Qpagos Mexico.
 
On August 31, 2015, QPAGOS Corporation entered into various agreements with the shareholders of Qpagos Mexico and Redpag to give effect to a reverse merger transaction (the “Reverse Merger’’). Pursuant to the Reverse Merger, the majority of the shareholders of Qpagos Mexico and Redpag effectively received shares in Qpagos Corporation, through various consulting and management agreements entered into with Qpagos Corporation and sold an effective 99.996% and 99.990% of the outstanding shares in Qpagos Mexico and Redpag, respectively to Qpagos Corporation. The series of transactions closed effective August 31, 2015. Upon the close of the Reverse Merger, Qpagos Corporation became the parent of Qpagos Mexico and Redpag and assumed the operations of these two companies as its sole business.
 
On May 12, 2016, Qpagos Corporation entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with QPAGOS and QPAGOS Merge, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of QPAGOS (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on May 12, 2016 Qpagos Corporation and Merger Sub merged (the “Merger”), and Qpagos Corporation continued as the surviving corporation of the Merger and became a wholly owned subsidiary of QPAGOS. As a result of the Merger, each outstanding share of Qpagos Corporation common stock was converted into the right to receive two shares of QPAGOS common stock as set forth in the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we issued, and Qpagos Corporation stockholders received in a tax-free exchange, shares of our common stock such that Qpagos Corporation stockholders owned approximately 91% of our company immediately after the Merger. In addition, each outstanding warrant of Qpagos Corporation was assumed by us and converted into a warrant to acquire a number of shares of our common stock equal to twice the number of shares of common stock of Qpagos Corporation subject to the warrant immediately before the effective time of the Merger at an exercise price per share of Company common stock equal to 50% of the warrant exercise price for Qpagos Corporation common stock. There were no options outstanding in Qpagos Corporation prior to the merger.

On November 1, 2019, we changed our name from QPAGOS to Innovative Payment Solutions, Inc. On November 1, 2019, we also filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a reverse split of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-10 (the “Reverse Stock Split”), effective on November 1, 2019. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, each ten (10) pre-split shares of common stock outstanding were automatically combined into one (1) new share of common stock. Unless otherwise stated, all share and per shares numbers in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.
 
On December 31, 2019, we consummated the disposal of Qpagos Corporation, including the two Mexican subsidiaries, Qpagos Mexico and Redpag, in exchange for 2,250,000 shares of common stock of Vivi Holdings, of which nine percent (9%) was allocated to the following: Gaston Pereira (5%), Andrey Novikov (2.5%), and Joseph Abrams (1.5%). The SPA was closed on December 31, 2019 after the satisfaction of customary conditions, the receipt of a final fairness opinion and the approval of our shareholders. Innovative Payment Solutions no longer has any business operations in Mexico and has retained its U.S. operations based in Calabasas, California.
