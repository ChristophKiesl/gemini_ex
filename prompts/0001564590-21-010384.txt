ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on November 17, 2017 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
 
On March 7, 2019 (the “IPO Closing Date”), we consummated our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 25,000,000 units (the “Units”) of the Company. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”), and one-half of one warrant of the Company (“Warrant”), each whole Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and for certain issuance of equity or equity linked securities) of Common Stock. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to us of $250,000,000. Simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 7,000,000 warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) to our sponsor, CFI Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”), at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, each exercisable to purchase one share of Common Stock at $11.50 per share, generating gross proceeds to us of $7,000,000. The Private Placement Warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the Warrants sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants may be net share (cashless) settled and are not redeemable so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. The sale of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
 
On the IPO Closing Date, $250,000,000 of the gross proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was deposited in a U.S.-based trust account (the “Trust Account”) with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company acting as trustee (the “Trustee”). Of the $7,000,000 held outside of the Trust Account, $5,000,000 was used to pay underwriting discounts and commissions, $300,000 was used to repay notes payable to our Sponsor and the balance was available to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. Funds held in the Trust Account have been invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of one hundred and eighty (180) days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), that invest only in direct U.S. government obligations. Funds will remain in the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of an initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any shares of Common Stock properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of such shares of Common Stock if we do not complete an initial business combination by June 30, 2021 (see ‘Extension Meeting” below), and (iii) the redemption of 100% of the shares of Common Stock if we are unable to complete an initial business combination by June 30, 2021 (subject to applicable law, see “Extension Meeting” below). 
 
On April 15, 2019, we announced that the holders of our Units may elect to separately trade the Common Stock and Warrants included in the Units commencing on April 16, 2019, on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations Capital Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbols “CRSA” and “CRSAW,” respectively. Those Units not separated continued to trade on the NASDAQ under the symbol “CRSAU.”
 
We believe our ability to consummate an initial business combination is enhanced by our entering into a forward purchase agreement (the “Forward Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which Crescent Capital Group Holdings LP (“Crescent”) has committed to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in such agreement, including a lock up period that restricts the transfer of securities issued pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement and registration rights granted thereto, an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock plus 833,333 Warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000,000 in cash in a private placement that will close immediately prior to an initial business combination, which such commitment Crescent may assign, in whole or in part, to certain transferees, including, but not limited to, its current or prospective limited partners (Crescent and such possible transferees together comprising the Forward Purchasers). The proceeds from the Forward Purchase Agreement will be used as part of the consideration in an initial business combination and, expenses in connection therewith. These purchases will be made regardless of whether any shares of Class A common stock are redeemed by our public stockholders in connection with an initial business combination and are intended to provide us with a minimum funding level for an initial business combination.
 
With respect to the above, past performance of our senior management team or Crescent is not a guarantee of the ability to successfully consummate an initial business combination. You should not rely on the historical record of management or Crescent as indicative of future performance. Neither management nor Crescent has past experience with a blank check company or special purpose acquisition company.

Agreement for Business Combination
 
On January 13, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Function Acquisition I Corp, a Delaware corporation and our direct, wholly owned subsidiary (“First Merger Sub”), Function Acquisition II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our direct, wholly owned subsidiary (“Second Merger Sub”), LiveVox Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“LiveVox”), and GGC Services Holdco, Inc., a Delaware corporation, solely in its capacity as the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of the stockholder of LiveVox (in such capacity, the “Stockholder Representative”). The Merger Agreement provides for, among other things, (i) the merger of First Merger Sub with and into LiveVox, with LiveVox continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Surviving Corporation”) and becoming our direct, wholly owned subsidiary as a consequence (the “First Merger”) and (ii) immediately following the First Merger and as part of the same overall transaction as the First Merger, the merger of the Surviving Corporation with and into Second Merger Sub with Second Merger Sub continuing as the surviving entity, which will be renamed such name as LiveVox shall designate no later than five business days prior to the closing of the transaction (the “Second Merger” and, together with the First Merger, the “Mergers” and, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”), in each case, in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement. Following the closing of the Business Combination, we will own, directly or indirectly, all the stock of LiveVox and its direct and indirect subsidiaries and LiveVox TopCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the sole stockholder of LiveVox as of immediately prior to the effective time of the First Merger (the “LiveVox Stockholder”) will hold a portion of the Company’s stock.
 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are subject to customary conditions of the respective parties, including the approval of the Business Combination and certain other actions related thereto by our stockholders, certain approvals or other determinations from certain regulatory authorities, as applicable, and the availability of a minimum amount of cash in the Trust Account (and/or from other specified sources, if necessary), after giving effect to redemptions by our public stockholders, if any. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Business Combination will be consummated.
 
For additional information regarding LiveVox, the Merger Agreement and the Business Combination, see the Proxy Statement/Prospectus initially filed by the Company on February 11, 2021.
 
Other than as specifically discussed, this report does not assume the closing of the Business Combination.
 
Extension Meeting
 
We mailed to our shareholders of record as of January 22, 2021, a definitive proxy statement for a special meeting of shareholders to be held on February 17, 2021 (the “Special Meeting”) to approve an extension of time for us to complete an initial business combination through June 30, 2021 (the “Extension Date”). The Charter Extension and Trust Extension Proposals were approved, providing our shareholders with more time to evaluate our Business Combination.
 
In connection with the vote to approve the Charter Extension and Trust Extension Proposals, the holders of 12,238 Class A ordinary shares properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.14 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of $124,138. As such, only approximately 0.05% of the Class A ordinary shares were redeemed and approximately 99.95% of the Class A ordinary shares remain outstanding. After the satisfaction of such redemptions, the balance in our trust account will be $253,467,308.
 
BUSINESS STRATEGY
 
Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify and complete an initial business combination with a growth-oriented, market-leading company in an industry that complements the collective investment experience and expertise of our management team to build long-term shareholder value. Key components of our business strategy include:
Leverage the Crescent Platform and Our Extensive Relationship Network to Source Acquisition Targets
 
We plan to leverage Crescent’s proprietary, extensive deal-sourcing network of strong, long-standing relationships with more than 300 private equity Sponsors to identify potential acquisition targets. Crescent’s position as a partner of choice for private equity firms, earned over 29 years, has resulted in significant deal flow, with the platform reviewing nearly 1,400 deals in 2020. This relationship network has led to numerous transactions which were proprietary or where a limited group of investors were invited to participate in the transaction process. In addition, we will also leverage our team’s expansive network of industry and lending community relationships 
 5

as well as relationships with management teams of former portfolio companies, investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, which we believe will provide us with a robust, differentiated source of potential acquisition candidates.
 
Identify and Acquire a Business that will Perform Well in Public Markets
 
Our investment philosophy is focused on finding attractively valued assets through deep, analytical evaluation of business fundamentals and the identification of opportunities for creating shareholder value, which may include operational or capital structure improvements, corporate governance leadership and/or expertise or guidance with implementing strategic growth initiatives. We believe that the demonstrated ability of our management team to source, evaluate and complete investments in a variety of industries over three decades and numerous business cycles, coupled with their established network and deep operational experience, will allow us to identify desirable acquisition opportunities and consummate a business combination. From the extensive experience of our management team, working in both public and private markets and overseeing recognized growth equity strategies, we will narrow our pipeline of potential acquisition targets to those that are positioned to thrive as public companies. We also believe that potential sellers of target businesses will view the fact that Crescent and our management team have assisted numerous companies in achieving successful shareholder transitions as a positive factor in considering whether or not to enter into a business combination with us.
 
Partner with the Acquired Business to Create Shareholder Value
 
We will seek to capitalize on the significant investing and operating experience and network of our management team to consummate an acquisition and drive shareholder value. Specifically, we will benefit from the acquisition experience of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Purdy, who was involved in the acquisitions of 12 portfolio companies with a combined transaction enterprise value of more than $15 billion during his tenure at Leonard Green & Partners (“LGP”). We will also leverage the significant public markets, management oversight and governance experience of our management team; collectively, they have held a governance position at more than 50 public and private companies. We believe that our management team’s network of current and former market-leading portfolio companies represent a tremendous asset that could be leveraged by the company with which we consummate a business combination. Additionally, we believe our management team has a demonstrated track record of identifying businesses at attractive valuations, enhancing the growth trajectory, building scale and personnel and investing in accretive acquisitions, resulting in increased shareholder value. We will also benefit from the large institutional investor base of Crescent, who has been supportive by investing alongside the firm in numerous transactions historically and could potentially serve as a deep source of future growth capital.
 
We intend to focus on diverse industries and sectors that complement our management team’s background so we can capitalize on their ability to identify, acquire and implement a growth strategy that will generate excess shareholder returns.
 
OUR INVESTMENT CRITERIA
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.

• | Favorable growth dynamics. We intend to acquire a business that has both demonstrated revenue growth historically and possesses favorable future growth characteristics, combined with a durable business model that is resistant to macroeconomic volatility. We will look to leverage the skill sets of our management team to help accelerate the sales growth of any business combination, given their extensive experience formulating and implementing growth initiatives.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consistent and predictable cash flows. We believe that companies with consistent cash flow characteristics provide management teams with increased flexibility, whether to pursue attractive acquisition opportunities, fund growth initiatives, expand horizontally or vertically or optimize capital structures. Importantly, attractive cash flows help businesses sustain operations over the course of the business cycle.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong management teams. Our investment history has been built upon partnering with talented management teams to grow businesses and create shareholder value. We also believe that properly aligning incentives with management is crucial and has led to positive outcomes for companies, shareholders and management teams alike historically.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Underappreciated value and/or sub-optimal capital structures. We intend to target companies that could benefit from the unique skill set and experience of our management team through increased investment capacity coupled with effective Sponsorship. We will leverage our long history of providing capital structure solutions, through either capital infusions, creative and/or unique structures or recapitalizations to optimize a company’s balance sheet and increase equity value.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Benefit from access to public equity and corporate governance leadership. We intend to target companies that will benefit from having public equity available to initiate accretive acquisitions. Our Chief Executive Officer has extensive experience assisting companies with add-on acquisitions, having worked with portfolio companies that completed more than 40 add-on acquisitions during his tenure at LGP. In addition, we intend to take advantage of the vast governance experience of our management team, who have collectively held a governance position at more than 50 public and private companies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Poised for transformative growth. We plan to seek companies that are at an inflection point in their own lifecycle, whether on the cusp of pursing a sizable acquisition, making a significant investment to expand their product offering and addressable market or expanding their geographic footprints. We believe the potential target would benefit from the experience of our management team, who have a demonstrated track record of successfully guiding companies through this critical part of their lifecycle.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Industries undergoing secular change. We intend to target companies operating within industries undergoing meaningful transformation. We believe our investment process, which has been refined over a number of business cycles, will allow us to properly identify the key characteristics of companies that will thrive in a changing industry environment. In addition, we expect to utilize the extensive network and relationships of our Sponsor to conduct deep due diligence, focusing on key themes, including secular growth dynamics and the competitive landscape.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into an initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to an initial business combination, which would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
 
INITIAL BUSINESS COMBINATION
 
NASDAQ listing rules require that an initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriters fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with an initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
 
We anticipate structuring an initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure an initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to an initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in an initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to an initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to an initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or 
 7

acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If an initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
 
OUR INITIAL BUSINESS COMBINATION PROCESS
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital planning experience.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, that an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
 
If members of our management team acquire public shares or warrants after the Initial Public Offering, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate an initial business combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor these obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue and the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating any legal obligation. Our officers and directors would continue to be subject to all other fiduciary duties owed to us and our stockholders and no other waivers of their respective fiduciary obligations have been provided to any such officers and directors. We do not have any plan for any waiver of the fiduciary duties of our officers and directors post-business combination.
 
Our Sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other special purpose acquisition company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination or we have failed to complete an initial business combination by the Extension Date. 
 
Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets
 
We believe our management team’s significant operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring, financing and selling businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
 
We believe this network provides our management team with a robust and consistent flow of acquisition opportunities which were proprietary or where a limited group of investors were invited to participate in the sale process. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with important sources of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, 
 8

we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
As more fully discussed in “Conflicts of Interest” below, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations to various entities that may present a conflict of interest. As a result of these duties and obligations, situations may arise in which business opportunities may be given to one or more of these other entities prior to being presented to us.
 
Our executive offices are located at 11100 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 2000, Los Angeles, CA 90025 and our telephone number is (310) 235-5900.
 
Status as a Public Company
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer target businesses an alternative to the traditional Initial Public Offering through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical Initial Public Offering. In a typical Initial Public Offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
 
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an Initial Public Offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1,070,000,000, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700,000,000 as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 
Financial Position
 
With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of $250,000,000 assuming no redemptions and after payment of $8,750,000 of deferred underwriting commissions, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete an initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
 
Effecting an initial business combination
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the Initial Public Offering. We intend to effectuate an initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and the forward purchase securities, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in an initial business combination. We may seek to complete an initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 9


If an initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with an initial business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing an initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We have not identified any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. Certain members of our management team are employed by Crescent or one of its affiliates. Messrs. Jean-Marc Chapus and Christopher G. Wright are continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue, for a business combination, but we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted, or had any discussions, formal or otherwise with, any prospective target business with respect to a business combination transaction with us.
 
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of an initial business combination, and we may effectuate an initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account.
 
In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with an initial business combination. 
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of aN initial business combination
 
NASDAQ listing rules require that an initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriters fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with an initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate an initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. There is no basis for investors in the Initial Public Offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete an initial business combination.
 
To the extent we effect an initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information, which will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete an initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which an initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.

 10

Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of an initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business.
 
Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing an initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:
 
 
• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after an initial business combination; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
 
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting an initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following an initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to an initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of an initial business combination.
 
Following an initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Business Combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.

Type of Transactions | Whether Stockholder Approval is Required
--------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 

 
Under NASDAQ’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for an initial business combination if, for example:
 
 
• | we issue shares of common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of Class A common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by NASDAQ listing rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding shares of common stock or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11

 
• | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
 
 
• | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities
 
In the event we seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with an initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of an initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares such persons may purchase. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. In the event our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates determine to make any such purchases at the time of a stockholder vote relating to an initial business combination, such purchases could have the effect of influencing the vote necessary to approve such transaction. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, we will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to (1) refrain from purchasing securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (2) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary.
 
In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 
The purpose of such purchases could be to (1) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of an initial business combination or (2) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of an initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of an initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 12


Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or any of their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with an initial business combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against an initial business combination. Such persons would select the stockholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with an initial business combination. Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will purchase shares only if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Any purchases by our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or any of their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will be made only to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or any of their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.
 
Redemption Rights For Public Stockholders Upon Completion of an initial business combination
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of an initial business combination at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At completion of the business combination, we will be required to purchase any public shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the Trust Account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our Sponsor has entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which it has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its 6,175,000 shares of Class F common stock (“Founder Shares”) and any public shares it may acquire in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. Our directors and officers have entered into letter agreements similar to the one signed by our Sponsor.
 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of an initial business combination either: (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination; or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 
 
• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
13

 
• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing an initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about an initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of an initial business combination, we and our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete an initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, after payment of the deferred underwriting commission (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to an initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination.
 
If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:
 
 
• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NASDAQ listing or Exchange Act registration.
 
In the event that we seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of an initial business combination.
 
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete an initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our initial stockholders have agreed (and their permitted transferees will agree) to vote their Founder Shares and any public shares held by them in favor of an initial business combination. Our directors and officers also have agreed to vote in favor of an initial business combination with respect to public shares acquired by them, if any. We expect that at the time of any stockholder vote relating to an initial business combination, our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees will own at least 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares without voting and, if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination. Our directors and officers have entered into letter agreements similar to the one signed by our initial stockholders with respect to public shares acquired by them, if any.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to an initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

Limitation on Redemption Upon Completion of An initial business combination if We Seek Stockholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with an initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our Sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our Sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete an initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against an initial business combination.
 
Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against an initial business combination at the holder’s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 15


Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of an initial business combination.
 
If an initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If an initial business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until the Extension Date. 
 
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No initial business combination
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have until the Extension Date to complete an initial business combination. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination by the Extension Date, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete an initial business combination by the Extension Date. 
 
Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to complete an initial business combination by the Extension Date. However, if our initial stockholders acquire public shares after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete an initial business combination by the Extension Date. 
 
Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination by the Extension Date, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). 
 
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the proceeds held outside the Trust Account which was $306,626 as of December 31, 2020, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay taxes we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account, the per share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less 
 16

than $10.00. See “Risk Factors—If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors described above. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. WithumSmith+Brown, PC (“Withum”), our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account.
 
Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our franchise and income taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our franchise and income taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in certain instances. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share. See “Risk Factors—If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share” and other risk factors described below.
 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to 
 17

$2,000,000 from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete an initial business combination by the Extension Date may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete an initial business combination by the Extension Date, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete an initial business combination by the Extension Date, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our Extension Date and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account.
 
As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, our Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay our franchise and income taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a 
 18

bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. See “Risk Factors—If, after we distribute the proceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.”
 
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination by the Extension Date or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of an initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with an initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with an initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. 
 

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our Initial Public Offering that will apply to us until the consummation of an initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and public shares in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

• | prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed initial business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in our Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in our Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we will consummate an initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of capital stock voted are voted in favor of an initial business combination;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if an initial business combination is not consummated by the Extension Date, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in our Trust Account; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prior to an initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from our Trust Account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of capital stock. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with an initial business combination, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may consummate an initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of capital stock voted by our stockholders voting at a duly held stockholders meeting.
 
COMPETITION
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for an initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will 
 19

be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for an initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
 
Conflicts of Interest
 
Certain of our directors and officers and affiliates of our Sponsor manage several investment vehicles. These entities may compete with us for acquisition opportunities in the same industries and sectors as we may target for an initial business combination. If these entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunities.
 
In addition, investment ideas generated within our Sponsor and other persons who may make decisions for the company, may be suitable for both us and for current or future entities managed by our directors, officers or affiliates of our Sponsor and may be directed to such investment vehicle rather than to us. As employees of Crescent or its affiliates, certain members of the management team are and in the future will be involved in the formation of and offerings by these companies as well as the identification, acquisition and management of investments by such companies. The letter agreement entered into with certain of our officers will not restrict them from undertaking any such activities. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise between our officers’ fiduciary and contractual obligations to these companies and our officers’ obligations to us. None of the members of our management team who are also employed by our Sponsor or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. Our management team, in their capacities as directors, officers or employees of our Sponsor or its affiliates in their other endeavors, may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above, current or future investment vehicles of our Sponsor or its affiliates, or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us, subject to applicable fiduciary duties. See “Risk Factors—Certain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.”
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor these obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties to us under Delaware law. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete an initial business combination.
 
Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest as it relates to the Business Combination:
 
 
• | the fact that our Sponsor, officers (other than our officer who was appointed subsequent to our Initial Public Offering, who does not own any shares of our Common Stock) and directors (including our independent directors) have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares of our Common Stock they may hold in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, including all of the Founder Shares;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the fact that our Sponsor has agreed to, in its capacity as the holder of a majority of our Class F Stock, waive the right to a conversion price adjustment with respect to all shares of our Class F Stock in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination, such authority granted to the majority holders of our Class F Stock in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the fact that our Sponsor paid an aggregate of $25,000 for 6,250,000 shares of Class F Stock (75,000 of which have been transferred to our independent directors, after giving effect to the (i) surrender of 1,437,500 shares on November 29, 2017 and (ii) forfeiture of 937,500 shares in April 2019) which will be converted into Common Stock upon the closing of the Business Combination, including the 2,725,000 shares that our Sponsor has agreed to cancel concurrently with the closing of the Business Combination and the Lock-Up Shares which will be subject to release only if the price of Common Stock trading on NASDAQ or another national securities exchange exceeds certain thresholds during the seven-year period following the closing of the Business Combination and will otherwise be forfeited and cancelled for no consideration, but which will have no value if the Business Combination is not consummated by our current extended date of June 30, 2021;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
20

 
• | the fact that our Initial Stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to their Founder Shares if we fail to complete an initial business combination by our current extended date of June 30, 2021;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if the Trust Account is liquidated, including in the event we are unable to complete an initial business combination within the required time period, our Sponsor has agreed to indemnify us to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below $10.00 per public share, or such lesser per public share amount as is in the Trust Account on the liquidation date, by the claims of prospective target businesses with which we have entered into an acquisition agreement or claims of any third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, but only if such a third party or target business has not executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the fact that our Sponsor will have the right to nominate two independent directors of the post-Business Combination Company pursuant to a stockholders agreement to be entered into upon closing of the Business Combination;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the anticipated continuation of two of our existing directors, Robert D. Beyer and Todd M. Purdy, as directors of the post-Business Combination Company;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the continued indemnification of our existing directors and officers and the continuation of our directors’ and officers’ liability insurance after the Business Combination;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the fact that our Sponsor, officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us and will not be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses if an initial business combination is not consummated by the Extension Date;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that, as described in the Charter Proposals and reflected in Annex C, our proposed Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will be amended to expressly elect not to be bound or governed by, or otherwise subject to, Section 203 of the DGCL, thereby removing certain restrictions on business combinations with interested stockholders (which amendment will become effective 12 months after the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation is filed and becomes effective);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that, at the closing of the Business Combination we will enter into the Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement, which provides for registration rights to, among others, our Sponsor, Crescent and their permitted transferees;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that Crescent has entered into the Forward Purchase Agreement with the Company, pursuant to which Crescent has committed to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Forward Purchase Agreement, including a lock-up period that restricts the transfer of securities issued pursuant to the Forward Purchase Agreement and registration rights granted thereto, an aggregate of 2,500,000 shares of Class A Stock plus 833,333 Warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000,000 in cash in a private placement that will close immediately prior to the Business Combination, which such commitment Crescent may assign, in whole or in part, to certain transferees, including, but not limited to, its current or prospective limited partners (Crescent and such possible transferees together comprising the Forward Purchasers); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | that Crescent, either alone or with our Sponsor, has the right but not the obligation to purchase immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination additional shares of Class A Stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to reasonably acceptable terms to be provided in a separate agreement, to the extent our total cash proceeds are less than $250,000,000.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The conflicts described above may not be resolved in our favor.
 
In general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:
 
 
• | the corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | the opportunity is within the corporation’s line of business; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it would not be fair to the corporation and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accordingly, as a result of multiple business affiliations, our officers and directors may have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business opportunities meeting the above-listed criteria to multiple entities. Furthermore, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of corporate opportunity will not apply with respect to any of our officers or directors in circumstances where the application of the doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have. Below is a table summarizing the entities to which our officers and directors currently have fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may present a conflict of interest:
 
 
Name of Individual | Entity Name | Entity’s Business | Affiliation 
Robert D. Beyer | Chaparal Investments LLC Jefferies Financial Group | Private investments Financial services | Chairman Director 
Jean-Marc Chapus | Crescent Capital Group LP | Alternative credit investments | Managing Partner 
Todd M. Purdy | N/A | | 
Christopher G. Wright | Crescent Capital Group LP | Alternative credit investments | Managing Partner 
Al Hassanein | Crescent Capital Group LP | Alternative credit investments | Controller 
George P. Hawley | Crescent Capital Group LP | Alternative credit investments | General Counsel 
Kathleen S. Briscoe | Dermody Properties Griffin Capital Resmark Equity Partners, LLC Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. | Real estate Asset management Real estate investments Business development | Partner, Chief Capital Officer Director Director Director
John J. Gauthier | JJG Advisory, LLC Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated | Investment consulting Reinsurance | Principal Owner Director 
Jason D. Turner | Venbrook Group, LLC | Insurance | Chief Executive Officer 
Sandra V. Naftzger | N/A | | 

 
Accordingly, if any of the above officers or directors become aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for any of the above entities to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor these obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that any of the foregoing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations will materially affect our ability to complete the Business Combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our Company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing a business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our business combination with such a company, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA, or from an independent accounting firm, that such a business combination is fair to our Company from a financial point of view.
 
Our Initial Stockholders have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and their public shares, if any, in favor of the Business Combination.
 
INDEMNITY
 
Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for an initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to consummate an initial business combination, and our public shareholders would receive such lesser amount 
 22

per share in connection with any redemptions of public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties, including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
 
FACILITIES
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 11100 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 2000, Los Angeles, CA 90025. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per month, up to the Extension Date, fee that we will pay an affiliate of our Sponsor for office space, utilities, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
EMPLOYEES
 
We currently have six officers and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of an initial business combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed an initial business combination. We presently expect our officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to complete an initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
Our Units, Common Stock and Warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and as a result we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at: http://www.sec.gov. The contents of this website are not incorporated into this filing. Further, our references to the uniform resource locator (“URL”) for this website are intended to be inactive textual references only.
 
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), or International Financing Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). A particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate may not have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such target business to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete a business acquisition with such a target business.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the Initial Public Offering Closing Date, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1,070,000,000, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700,000,000 as of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1,000,000,000 in 
 23

non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
