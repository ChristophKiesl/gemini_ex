Item 1. Business
Doing Business in China and Hong Kong Corporate Overview

Ajia Innogroup Holdings Ltd. is a Nevada holding company that conducts all of its operations and operates its business in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and Hong Kong, through its subsidiaries, in particular, (collectively the “Operating Subsidiaries”). Investors in our ordinary shares should be aware that they are not permitted to directly hold equity interests in the Chinese operating entities. Investors can only purchase equity solely Ajia Innogroup Holdings Ltd. which owns the majority equity interests in our Operating Subsidiaries. 

Because of our corporate structure, we as well as the investors are subject to unique risks due to uncertainty of the interpretation and the application of the PRC laws and regulations. We are also subject to the risks of uncertainty about any future actions of the PRC government in this regard. We may also be subject to sanctions imposed by PRC regulatory agencies including the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”) if we fail to comply with their rules and regulations. The Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our operating structure in the future, and this would likely result in a material change in our financial performance, our results of operations, our actual operations in China, and/or the value of our ordinary shares, which could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless.

We face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties related to having all of our operations in China. The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the ability of a China-based company, such as us, to conduct its business, accept foreign investments, or list on U.S. or other foreign exchanges. For example, we may face risks associated with regulatory approvals of offshore offerings, anti-monopoly regulatory actions, as well as oversight on cybersecurity and data privacy. Such risks could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our ordinary shares or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our ordinary shares and/or other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. 

The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to securities regulation, data protection, cybersecurity and mergers and acquisitions and other matters. The central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations with little advance notice that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Government actions in the future could significantly affect economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to materially change our operating activities or divest ourselves of any interests we hold in Chinese assets. Our business may be subject to various government and regulatory interference. We may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. Our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to our business or industry.

Given recent statements by the Chinese government indicating an intent to exert more oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, any such action could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless.

Additionally, more stringent criteria have been imposed by the SEC and the PCAOB, recently, our securities may be prohibited from trading if our auditor cannot be fully inspected. As of the date of the report, J&S Associate, our auditor, is not subject to the determinations as to the inability to inspect or investigate registered firms completely announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. The recent joint statement by the SEC and PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB. These developments could add uncertainties to our offering. 

As of September 2022, we have disposed of our operation in the PRC, and operate primarily from our Hong Kong based subsidiaries. Current PRC regulations permit PRC Subsidiaries to pay dividends through subsidiaries in Hong Kong, but only out of accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of PRC Subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. As of the date of the Report, we have had no transactions that involved the transfer of cash or assets throughout our corporate structure since at least July 1, 2020. From inception to dissolution our PRC Subsidiary did not transfer cash or assets to the Company, including by way of dividends. Additionally, no transfers, dividends, or distributions have been made to our U.S. investors. Although we have not relied on our Hong Kong subsidiary for dividends or other distributions in the past, in the event that our Hong Kong subsidiary were to issue dividends or distribution of cash or earnings in the future, our Hong Kong subsidiary may become subject to the applicable to PRC foreign currency control.

The Company does not currently plan or anticipate transferring cash or other assets from our operations in Hong Kong to our parent company or U.S. investors. However, there are currently no restrictions on our ability to transfer cash or distribute earnings among our Hong Kong subsidiary and our parent company and U.S. investors, if needed. Currently, cash can be transferred between our holding company and subsidiaries through intercompany fund advances. Although, the PRC, the PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and the remittance of currency out of the PRC which may restrict our PRC Subsidiaries’ ability to transfer cash from our PRC Subsidiaries to our other non-mainland China entities.  To the extent cash is generated in our Hong Kong and may need to be used to fund operations outside of mainland Hong Kong, currently such funds would be available to the Company. However, if certain PRC laws and regulations, including existing laws and regulations and those enacted or promulgated in the future were to become applicable to our Hong Kong Subsidiary in the future, and to the extent cash is generated in our Hong Kong subsidiary and to the extent assets (other than cash) in our business are located in Hong Kong or held by a Hong Kong entity and may need to be used to fund operations outside of Hong Kong, such funds or assets may not be available due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability of us and our subsidiaries to transfer funds or assets by the PRC government. 

To date, there have not been any such dividends or other distributions from our Hong Kong or previous PRC Subsidiary to any entity located outside of mainland China. However, as of the date of this Report, we do not believe that there is any current restriction on our ability to transfer cash or distribute earnings to our parent company and U.S. investors.

To be certain, there can be no assurance that the PRC government will not intervene or impose restrictions on our ability, in the future, to transfer or distribute cash within our organization, which could result in an inability or prohibition on making transfers or distributions to entities outside of mainland China and Hong Kong, this would adversely affect our business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, limitations currently imposed by the PRC government as described hereto do not  our or our subsidiaries’ ability to transfer cash 
or distribute earnings to our parent company and U.S. investors

In September 2017, the Company began exploring a business plan for a sales system for food and beverage products also sometimes referred to as a catering integration system.

On April 25, 2018, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Guangzhou Shengjia Trading Co., Ltd. of Guangzhou, China (“Shengjia”) has entered into an agreement with Guangzhou Renhai Network Technology Co., Ltd. (“Renhai”) in which Shengjia would replace its 10% interest in the Alipay payment code business development project (“Alipay Project”), with a 30% interest of Renhai’s new China Mobile project. Renhai has recently reached an agreement with China Mobile Communications Corporation (“China Mobile”) whereby Renhai and China Mobile are to sign an agreement appointing Renhai as one of China Mobile’s marketers in promoting China Mobile’s business products for the period from April 1, 2018 to September 30, 2018. Renhai’s China Mobile agreement will be extended once certain business targets are fulfilled.

Nevertheless, even with the above remedies, the returns from the projects are still not satisfied by the Company’s management and are far below the estimations made from Renhai to the Company. In this regard, on December 28, 2018, both parties agreed that the agreements between Shengia and Renhai are rescinded and voided. Renhai shall return the Company’s 3,000,000 shares to the Company for cancellation and the Company shall return all the incomes previously received from Renhai. The Company cancelled these 3,000,000 shares of common stock on December 28, 2018.

On July 28, 2018, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $300,000.00 to Full Yick International Ltd. Pursuant to the terms the convertible promissory note was convertible into 93,750,000 common shares of the Company at $0.0032 per share on July 31, 2019. On or about August 9, 2019, Full Yick International Ltd. exercised their option to convert the $300,000.00 note into 93,750,000 common shares of the Company, which constitutes approximately 92.8% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company and instructed the Company to issue the shares to approximately 84 shareholders. Of those approximately 84 shareholders, the largest, Full Yick International, Ltd. holds 12,038,723 shares, or approximately 11.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company. There are no arrangements between the members of the former and new control groups and their associates with respect to election of directors or other matters.

On September 20, 2019, Mr. Kin Chung (Ken) Tam was appointed as members of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company’s Executive directors. Mr. Hung Hin Samuel Leung and Mr. Kwok Fai (Thomas) Yip were appointed as members of the Board of the Company’s Independent and Non-executive directors - Audit committee.

On March 30, 2020, Splendor Radiant Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Allied Precision Medicine Consultants Limited (“Allied”), a Hong Kong corporation, in which the Parties have committed to jointly promote stem cell products and services in Hong Kong and Macau. Ajia has initially issued 100,000 shares of its common stock to Allied to acquire 50% sharing of the profits in this project. The Board shall then appoint an independent third party to carry out due diligence and valuation of the project and, based upon the recommendation of this valuation report, the Board shall issue additional common shares of Ajia to Allied as fair consideration and compensation to acquire 50% profit sharing interest in the project. The project has not yet commenced.

Ms. Tang resigned from the position of COO concurrently with this appointment.

On November 17, 2020, subsequent to our year end, Mr. Zhi Qiang Liang resigned as Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Yip was appointed as Chief Executive Officer.

In October 16, 2020, Splendor Radiant Limited entered into a joint venture agreement with its strategic partner, Mr. Tsz Man (Eric) Ngan. Both parties agreed to establish a joint venture relationship in order to collaborate to form a company, Ajia Corporate Systems Architecture Solution Limited (“ACSA”) which Splendor Radiant own 51% of the shares.

TAPF is focusing on the money lending business on second mortgage on property market and lending on crypto assets as collateral that seeks for 8% to 10% return on principle per annum. The Company believes that the finance business in Hong Kong is profitable and has great potential because of the increasing demand for lending on second mortgages on property and cryptocurrency assets.

In June 2021, ACSA purchased 51% shares of Jia Yu Insurance Finance limited (“JYIF”), which is a licensed Insurance brokerage firm in Hong Kong. JYIF’s primary role is to provide local lump sum universal life, annuity assurance and offshore insurance products both life and non-life, which include compliant US PPLI, UL, and IUL policies, to designated clients asset growth purposes with complied tax solutions. There is a growing need and demand for Asian clients to purchase compliant PPLI, UL, and IUL policies in order to receive tax benefits and investment returns, and these products are becoming increasingly popular. The Company utilizes Hong Kong as a hub to organize US PPLI, UL, and IUL policies for high-net-worth clients from China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia. PPLI, IUL, and UL policies are increasingly in demand, and the Company has a professional technical team as well as US lawyers and tax advisors on hand to service these clients as a one-stop shop for all their insurance needs.

In 2021, Guangzhou Shengjia Trading Co., Ltd (“GST”), subsidiary of AJIA, aims to provide back-end support on project called “Easy Picture Mobile Application” (“Easy Picture”).

Business Plan

In September 2017, the Company began exploring a business plan for a sales system for food and beverage products also sometimes referred to as a catering integration system. The system consists of a website and app which offers menu and ordering systems for end users, which predominantly consists of restaurants and food vendors. Its catering integration system has a crossover sales promotion program with our restaurants and food suppliers’ members to set up an incentive program for their seasonal and festival sales to meet with the HK Government consumption vouchers scheme during the COVID-19. The Company generates revenue from the licensing of its sales system and we provide all necessary training to restaurant staff, system maintenance and updates.

On December 1, 2017, the Company acquired a ten percent (10%) ownership interest in a collection code project (“Project”), the purpose of which is to improve the marketability and market penetration of Alipay Network Technology Co., Ltd. (“Alipay”) collection code system. The Company plans to acquire additional interest in this project as the project develops.

On October 15, 2020, the Company ratified entry into a Memorandum of Understanding with Union Patron Limited for the formation of holding joint venture company, AJIA Corporate Systems Architecture Solution Ltd (“Ajia Corporate”), which the Company shall own a 51% interest in. Ajia Corporate is a company registered in Hong Kong and intends to enter a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) to expand its business developments in the following areas:


1. | Big Data Strategic enterprise solution,

The Company’s insurance brokerage firm, Jia Yu Insurance Finance limited (“JYIF”), in which Ajia Corporate owns 51% interest, is a licensed brokerage firm in Hong Kong. JYIF’s primary role is to design and place insurance for high net worth clients in Asia who either reside or plan to reside abroad.

The Company shall share 100% of the profits and losses of the offering of Products to third party customers which are introduced by UPL. 

Principal Products, Services and Their Markets

In last year, our business plan consisted of the following three primary segments: 1) the sales and licensing of our point of sales system for food and beverage products also sometimes referred to as a catering integration system, which we offer in Hong Kong, 2) our insurance private placement operations through Ajia Corporate Systems Architecture Solution Limited (“ACSA”), and 3) our Easy Picture application. We hope to expand our markets outside of Hong Kong in the future.
Status of Publicly Announced New Products or Services

Ajia currently has no new publicly announced products or services.

Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Position in the Industry

Ajia intends to establish itself as a competitive company in the point of sale technology market. Ajia’s main competitors are firms offering similar technologies and services. Our largest competitors are Multiable and MasterSoft.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Agreements or Contracts

As part of our business, we will seek to protect our intellectual property rights in various ways, including through trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, patents, patent applications, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights. At this time, however, there are no aspects of our business plan which require a patent, trademark, or product license. We have not entered into any vendor agreements or contracts that give or could give rise to any obligations or concessions.

Governmental Controls, Approval and Licensing Requirements

Our operation through ACSA requires a license from the Hong Kong insurance authority to operate. We were granted a three years license for our coming operation from 24 June, 2021 to 23 June, 2024. Additionally, certain roles within ACSA require an individual to hold a broker’s license from August 2021. We currently have 12 licensed individuals employed by ACSA.

As of September 2022, we have disposed of our operation in the PRC, and operate primarily from our Hong Kong based subsidiaries. Apart from customary business laws and regulations, the PRC government does not regulate the catering, services and total solutions for restaurants business industry. The PRC government may, however, from time to time institute rules and regulations on such businesses which makes it difficult or impossible for us to operate successfully, if at all, in the PRC. Please see the section on “Risk Factors” for further details.

Other than as mentioned above, we are unaware of any government regulations that are directly affecting our business, however, as we grow our business activities may become subject to various governmental regulations in different countries in which we operate, including regulations relating to: various business/investment approvals; trade affairs, including customs, import and export control; competition and antitrust; anti-bribery; advertising and promotion; intellectual property; consumer and business taxation; foreign exchange controls; personal information protection; labor; human rights; conflict; occupational health and safety; environmental; and recycling requirements.

Research and Development Activities and Costs

We have spent no time on specialized research and development activities, and have no plans to undertake any research or development in the future.

Cash Management Systems

We have no cash management policies that dictate how funds are transferred.

Number of Employees

The Company has approximately 20 part and full time employees at ACSA and 6 employees and IT support personnel working with Easy Picture application. We have no other significant employees other than our officers and directors and one employee who is responsible for the accounting and general administrative matters. In addition, the Company outsources its financial and management matters to various management consultants during the year. We intend to increase the size of our management team and hire additional employees in the future to manage the continued growth of our company and to increase our sales force and marketing efforts.
Place of Operation

Our executive and operating office is located at Room 1001, 10/F., Grandmark, No. 10 Granville Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong. Our management team is located at this office and will have to travel to Asian regions regularly to pursue the development of its businesses.
Regulatory Permission

We are currently not required to obtain approval from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, however, if our subsidiaries or the holding company were required to obtain approval in the future and were denied permission from Chinese authorities to list on U.S. exchanges, we will not be able to continue listing on a U.S. exchange, which would materially affect the interest of the investors. It is uncertain when and whether the Company will be required to obtain permission from the PRC government to list on U.S. exchanges in the future, and when such permission is obtained, whether it will be rescinded. Although the Company is currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC federal or local government to list on U.S. exchanges and has not received any denial to list on a U.S. exchange, our operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry. If we are subsequently advised by any Chinese authorities that permission for this offering and/or listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market was required, we may not be able to obtain such permission in a timely manner, if at all. If this risk occurs, our ability to offer securities to investors could be significantly limited or completely hindered and the securities currently being offered may substantially decline in value or become worthless. 

Recently, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, which were made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Pursuant to the Opinions, Chinese regulators are required to accelerate rulemaking related to the overseas issuance and listing of securities, and update the existing laws and regulations related to data security, cross-border data flow, and management of confidential information. Numerous regulations, guidelines and other measures are expected to be adopted under the umbrella of or in addition to the Cybersecurity Law and Data Security Law. As of the date of this report, no official guidance or related implementation rules have been issued. As a result, the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities remain unclear on how they will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC governmental authorities.

On December 28, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China jointly with the relevant authorities formally published Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) which will took effect on February 15, 2022 and replace the former Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2020). Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) stipulates that operators of critical information infrastructure purchasing network products and services, and online platform operator (together with the operators of critical information infrastructure, the “Operators”) carrying out data processing activities that affect or may affect national security, shall conduct a cybersecurity review, any online platform operator who controls more than one million users’ personal information must go through a cybersecurity review by the cybersecurity review office if it seeks to be listed in a foreign country. Given that: (i) we do not possess personal information on more than one million users in our business operations; and (ii) data processed in our business does not have a bearing on national security and thus may not be classified as core or important data by the authorities, we would not be required to apply for a cybersecurity review under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021).

Our PRC subsidiary was disposed of on September 1, 2022 and we do not believe the Company or its PRC subsidiary are or will become  subject to enhanced cybersecurity review or investigation. Further, while  we continue to have operations in Hong Kong through the Hong Kong subsidiaries, we believe that our operations are not affected by this since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon the legislative or administrative regulation making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated, if any. It is also highly uncertain what the potential impacts such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our business operations, its ability to accept foreign investments and the listing of our Shares on a U.S. or other foreign exchanges. If certain PRC laws and regulations were to become applicable to a company such as us in the future, the application of such laws and regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, any of which may cause the value of our securities, including our common  Shares, to significantly decline or become worthless.

If the CSRC, CAC or other regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals, we may be unable to obtain such approvals and we may face sanctions by the CSRC, CAC or other PRC regulatory agencies for failure to seek their approval which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to our investors and the securities currently being offered may substantially decline in value and be worthless.

Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act

U.S. laws and regulations, including the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or HFCAA, may restrict or eliminate our ability to complete a business combination with certain companies, particularly those acquisition candidates with substantial operations in China.

On March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. An identified issuer will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies it as having a “non-inspection” year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. In June 2021, the Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if signed into law, would reduce the time period for the delisting of foreign companies under the HFCAA to two consecutive years instead of three years. If our auditor cannot be inspected by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, for two consecutive years, the trading of our securities on any U.S. national securities exchanges, as well as any over-the-counter trading in the U.S., will be prohibited. Additionally, and as a result of a failure to be inspected, the exchange on which we are then listed may determine to delist our securities. 

On September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final rule implementing the HFCAA, which provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCAA, whether the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. On December 2, 2021, the SEC issued amendments to finalize rules implementing the submission and disclosure requirements in the HFCA Act. The rules apply to registrants that the SEC identifies as having filed an annual report with an audit report issued by a registered public accounting firm that is located in a foreign jurisdiction and that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in foreign jurisdictions. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report on its determinations that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong, because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, J&S Associate, our auditor, is not subject to the determinations as to the inability to inspect or investigate registered firms completely announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021.
