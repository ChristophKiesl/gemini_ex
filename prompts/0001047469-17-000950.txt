     Item 1.    Business 
  Our Mission 
         2U partners with great colleges and universities to build what we believe is the world's best online education. Our platform provides a comprehensive fusion of technology, services and data architecture to transform our clients, historically campus-based universities of the highest quality and rigor, into digital versions of themselves. Why should a student need to pick up their life, quit their job and move to attend a graduate program at a great university? With 2U's solutions, they don't have to anymore. 
 Overview 
         We are a leading provider of cloud-based software-as-a-service, or SaaS, technology and technology-enabled services that enable leading nonprofit colleges and universities to deliver their degree programs at scale to students anywhere. Our SaaS technology consists of an innovative online learning environment, where our clients deliver their high-quality educational content to students in a live, intimate and engaging setting. We also provide a comprehensive suite of integrated applications, including a content management system and a customer relationship management system, that serve as the back-end infrastructure of the programs we enable. This technology is fused with technology-enabled services, including student acquisition services, content development services, student and faculty support, clinical placement services, and admissions applications advising services. This suite of technology tightly integrated with technology-enabled services, optimized with data analysis and machine learning techniques, provides a comprehensive set of capabilities that would otherwise require the purchase of multiple, disparate point solutions, and allows our clients' programs to expand and operate at scale, providing the comprehensive infrastructure colleges and universities need to attract, enroll, educate, support and graduate their students. 
         We provide the significant domain expertise and operating capacity our clients require to scale and operate successfully in the online environment. Utilizing data analysis and machine learning techniques, the technology-enabled services we provide are designed to improve enrollment and retention of our clients' students as well as to provide those students with a complete, high-quality educational experience. We have primary responsibility for identifying qualified students for our clients' programs, generating potential student interest in the programs and driving applications to the programs. We deploy sophisticated digital program marketing and student acquisition capabilities, and we work closely with our clients to help them create highly engaging multimedia instructional content for delivery through our innovative learning environment, Online Campus. We also provide the services that support the complete lifecycle of a higher education program, including advising prospective students through the admissions application process, providing technical, success coaching and other support, facilitating accessibility to individuals with disabilities, facilitating in-program field placements, conducting faculty recruiting, immersion support, and obtaining state regulatory approvals. 
         Through our experience launching and operating programs with leading nonprofit colleges and universities, we have developed a proprietary program-selection algorithm, which enables us to systematically identify degrees at colleges and universities that we believe have the highest probability of successfor us, our clients, and their students. The algorithm not only enables us to deploy capital with greater confidence, but it also provides our clients with greater assurance of, and visibility into, program success. 
         We believe that by delivering high-quality degree programs online using our solutions, our clients can improve educational outcomes and career opportunities for a larger number of students and, by doing so, broaden the global reach of their brands while maintaining their academic rigor and admissions standards. By deploying our solutions, clients give their students, who receive the same 
 3

   degree or credit as their on-campus counterparts and generally pay equivalent tuition, the option of pursuing their educations without potentially incurring the burden of moving, leaving existing employment or giving up family and community support networks. This can substantially reduce the total cost of obtaining a degree and lower a student's total debt burden. It can also allow students for whom relocating is not an option to obtain a higher quality education than they might be able to access in their local communities. 
         Our compensation from our clients consists primarily of a specified share of the tuition and fees paid to our clients by students in the programs we enable, which we believe aligns our interests with those of our clients. This revenue model, combined with long contractual terms typically between 10 and 15 years, enables us to make the investment in technology, integration, content production, program marketing, student and faculty support and other services necessary to create large, successful programs. In addition, a significant percentage of our annual revenue is related to students returning to our clients' programs after their first semester. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, 62% of our revenue was related to students who had enrolled and completed their first semester prior to the start of the year. We believe this high percentage of revenue attributable to returning students contributes to the predictability and recurring nature of our business. 
         We have achieved significant growth in a relatively short period of time. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our revenue was $205.9 million, $150.2 million and $110.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our net losses were $20.7 million, $26.7 million and $29.0 million, respectively, and our Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $4.5 million, a loss of $6.6 million and a loss of $14.8 million, respectively. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, see "Selected Financial DataAdjusted EBITDA." From our inception through December 31, 2016, more than 24,000 unique individuals have enrolled as students in our clients' programs, and 83% of students who have entered these programs have either graduated or remain enrolled. By the time the last of these individuals graduate or leave our clients' programs, we estimate that they will have generated more than $1.5 billion in total program tuition and fees for our clients. 
   Our Approach 
         Our approach to providing our solutions to leading nonprofit colleges and universities is as follows: 
 

 Data-Driven Approach to Program
Selection.  Through our experience launching and operating programs with leading nonprofit colleges and universities, we have developed a
proprietary program-selection algorithm to drive the process for identifying new programs and clients. Our algorithm draws on a wide variety of data including the operating history of our existing
programs, and is based on key market variables, including the existing market size of a degree, potential student demographics and client characteristics. We believe our approach to identifying
potential programs enables us to systematically identify degrees at colleges and universities in specific geographic regions that we believe have the highest probability of success. Not only does it
enable us to deploy capital with greater confidence, it also provides our clients with greater assurance of, and visibility into, program success. 
 Long-Term Relationships.  Our
client relationships are characterized by close, ongoing collaboration with faculty and administration, as well as a deep integration between our clients' academic missions and operations and our
solutions. Our compensation from our clients consists primarily of a specified share of the tuition and fees paid to our clients by students in the programs we enable, which we believe aligns our
interests with those of our clients. This revenue model, combined with long contractual terms, enables us to make the investment in technology, integration, content production, program marketing,
student and faculty support and other services necessary to create large, successful programs. 

 4

   

 Bundled Technology and Services with a Focus on
Quality.  We believe that our solutions offer extensive features, high configurability, an intuitive user interface and the ability to support
synchronous and asynchronous learning at scale. Our technology-enabled services are tightly integrated with our SaaS technology and together they provide a broad set of capabilities that would
otherwise require the purchase of multiple, disparate point solutions, and the employment of significant human resources and expertise. 
 Driving High Quality Student
Outcomes.  We are committed to delivering the technology and services required to ensure that every student and faculty member is fully supported
throughout the life of each program. This model is designed to enable our clients to deliver academic programs that align with their brands and produce positive student outcomes, not only in
educational achievement but also in terms of the following key measures of success. 


Net Promoter Score.    We regularly conduct Net Promoter
Score® surveys with the students in each of our client programs. Net Promoter Score is a commonly used measure of customer loyalty and satisfaction. We believe that the favorable scores
typically received demonstrate that we deliver our solutions in an effective and user-friendly manner. 
Retention.    Our model is designed to support student satisfaction
with, and retention in, our clients' programs. Through December 31, 2016, 83% of students who have ever entered our clients' programs have either graduated or remain enrolled. 
First Attempt Board Pass Rates.    In client programs that lead to
licensure, we track and measure first attempt board pass rates to ensure that students in our client programs are achieving their desired goals. In 2015, the first attempt board pass rate in
Georgetown University's family nurse practitioner program was 97%. 

 Attractive Financial Model with Significant Predictability and
Visibility.  We believe our financial model delivers significant operating leverage and visibility. Given the long-term nature of our contracts
and the insight we receive from our program selection algorithm, we are able to benefit from increasing enrollments in clients' programs as those programs mature, leading to both revenue growth and
expanding operating margins. In addition, we believe the significant portion of our revenue that is typically attributable to returning students contributes to the predictability and recurring nature
of our business. 
 Data-Driven Approach to
Marketing.  We believe that our shared marketing funnel of prospective students across our client programs in the same or similar degree verticals
delivers marketing leverage that allows us to acquire additional students for the same cost. The revenue generated by those additional students allows us to deploy additional marketing spend for
programs in that degree vertical to acquire even more students for those programs. In addition, we use data analytics and machine learning to ensure that our marketing efforts are focused on finding
prospective students for the right programs at times when conversion is more likely. 

 Our Growth Strategy 
         We intend to continue our industry leadership as a provider of cloud-based SaaS technology and technology-enabled services that enable leading nonprofit colleges and universities to deliver education online. Our approach to growth is disciplined and focused on long-term success. The principal elements of our strategy are to: 


 Add Programs in New Graduate Degree
Verticals.  Add graduate-level programs with new and current clients in new degree verticals within our core market of selective colleges and
universities. 

 5

   

 Add Programs in Current Graduate Degree
Verticals.  Add graduate-level programs with new and current clients in degree verticals in which we have existing programs. We believe this
approach, which we refer to as our Multiple Program Vertical strategy, will enable us to leverage our program marketing investments across multiple client programs within specific academic
disciplines, expanding the number of students who can access high-quality educations and significantly decreasing student acquisition costs within those disciplines. 
 Increase Enrollment at Existing Clients'
Programs.  Increase student enrollments within the existing programs we enable for our clients. We will seek to accomplish this by acquiring an
increasing number of students for our clients' existing degree programs and by diversifying and innovating our degree offerings within a program. 
 Grow International, Undergraduate and Non-Degree
Presence.  We believe that there is significant international demand for our solutions as colleges and universities worldwide seek to extend their
brands by accessing the growing global market for higher education. We also believe that there may be significant opportunities in the future to offer additional high-quality digital education
experiences to undergraduate students, and students seeking non-degree alternatives, such as certificates. As we evaluate these growth strategies, we periodically consider, and are currently
considering, acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights in an effort to expand our product
offerings outside of our core business, extend our technological leadership or expand the markets in which we operate. We expect to continue to evaluate, and may enter into, acquisitions and
investments in the future as opportunities are presented. 

 Our Solutions 
         Our solutions consist of our cloud-based SaaS technology fused with technology-enabled services, which we optimize with data analysis and machine learning techniques. This suite of technology and services allows our clients' programs to expand and operate at scale, and provides the comprehensive infrastructure colleges and universities need to attract, enroll, educate, support and graduate their students. 
   Proprietary, Cloud-Based SaaS Technology 
   Online Campus 
         Our innovative online learning environment, Online Campus, enables our clients to offer high-quality educational content together with instructor-led classes in a live, intimate and engaging setting, averaging 12 students per session, all accessible through proprietary web-based and mobile applications. Online Campus allows our clients to provide a personalized learning environment for faculty and students as well as a robust online educational community. 
         Online Campus powers the following: 
 

 Virtual, Live Classes and Groups.  Online Campus enables a variety of live,
small-group class sessions that are accessed online. Through Online Campus, instructors can simultaneously lead video group discussions, customize the virtual classroom to their individual styles and
display a variety of documents, images, charts, notes and videos. Additionally, Online Campus is available for students to collaborate in planned or ad hoc study or work groups, regardless of day or
time. 
 Delivery of High-Quality, Engaging Content.  Through Online Campus, we and
our clients collaboratively create, publish and deliver video and other asynchronous content, interactive course lectures, individual and group assignments and assessments. We have developed
technology solutions to augment our content delivery capabilities, including our Bi-Directional Learning Tool, a technology we initially created to facilitate the Socratic method of teaching law. 

 6

   

This
technology enhances interaction between a faculty member and students, both individually and as a group, by blending asynchronous content and real-time student responses in the online
environment. 


 Integrated Back-End Applications 
         Our integrated back-end applications launch, operate and support our clients' programs, and seamlessly communicate between their existing university information technology systems and our information technology systems. In addition, these applications provide clients with real-time data and deep analytical insight related to student performance and engagement, student satisfaction, and enrollment. 
         Our back-end applications include the following: 
 

 New Program Launch and Operations.  We use an application we call Central
Park, which unifies our suite of applications and better automates the standup of technology infrastructure for new client programs, so that we can launch new client programs more quickly and
efficiently. In addition, Central Park has a graphic interface that allows non-technology oriented employees to create a program website, initiate online applications for students and build Online
Campus for a program. We also use an application we call Uber-Conf, which translates program-specific code to simplify program-specific complexity. We believe that this application simplifies not only
the effort we are required to expend in launching new programs, but also enables non-technology oriented employees to support the data analytics and operational needs across our business. 
 University Systems Integration.  We use an application we call Port
Authority, which integrates our technology with our clients' information technology systems. This application automates the student enrollment process, which allows us to more efficiently and quickly
enroll students, thereby increasing our student-to-support staff ratios, while reducing the potential for human error. 
 Content Management System.  Our content management system enables us and our
clients to author, review and deploy the asynchronous content for their online programs through Online Campus. The content management system includes a set of project management and collaboration
tools that allow our clients' faculty to seamlessly integrate their work with that of our course production and content development staff. 
 Admissions Application Processing Portal.  Our proprietary admissions
application system, known as the Online Application and Recommendation System, or OARS, automates the online admissions application process for prospective students of our clients' programs. OARS is
integrated with the primary marketing site for each program, directly funneling prospective students into each client's existing admissions application process and providing automated workflow for
that process. Additionally, our system automates faculty review and student notification to improve the efficiency of these processes. 
 Customer Relationship Management.  We have developed customer relationship
management deployments configured for each client's specific program characteristics. Each deployment serves as the data hub for scheduling, student acquisition, student application, faculty
admissions review, enrollment and student support for each program. Our clients and our staff, as appropriate, can review, maintain and track this information to ensure that functions driven both by
the client and by us are properly coordinated.

     Technology-Enabled Services 
         We offer a comprehensive suite of technology-enabled services, many of which are optimized with data analytics and machine learning techniques, that support the complete lifecycle of a higher education program. These services include the following: 
 

 Content Development.  Leveraging our content management system, our content
development staff works closely with our clients' faculty in a collaborative process to produce high-quality, engaging online coursework and content. We produce scripted and casual videos in studio
and on location, transform static content into interactive materials and ultimately assemble customized online course materials for delivery through our Online Campus. While our clients retain control
of and responsibility for the curricula, we work closely with them to present the content in a highly engaging manner. 
 Student Acquisition.  Leveraging data analytics and machine learning
techniques, we provide dedicated program marketing services to drive applications for each client program. Our marketing teams develop creative assets, such as websites related to the fields of study
of our clients' programs, and execute campaigns aimed at acquiring students cost-effectively. Our search engine optimization team supports our prospective student generation efforts across all of our
clients' programs. Our campaigns are focused on finding the right prospective student at the right time in his or her search. 
 Admissions Application Advising:  Leveraging our customer relationship
management deployments and other technology, our program-dedicated teams work with prospective students as they consider and apply to a client program. Once a student has submitted a completed
admissions application package through the OARS portal, it is routed to and reviewed by the university admissions office, which renders the final admission decision. 
 Student and Faculty Support:  We augment each student's academic experience
by assigning a dedicated advisor to provide ongoing individualized non-academic support. We also provide a dedicated support team that supports and trains university administration and faculty on how
to use our solutions to facilitate outstanding live instruction. 
 In-Program Student Field Placements:  Our field placement team is dedicated
to securing in-program field placement opportunities for students enrolled in our clients' programs. Leveraging a geo-location database, we work closely with faculty to identify and approve sites that
meet curriculum requirements. Through December 31, 2016, our placement team has facilitated nearly 32,000 individual in-program field placements in approximately 25,000 organizations around the
world. 
 Accessibility:  For students with disabilities, we are able to facilitate
accessibility across our solutions. These include providing screen-reading technology, captioning, subtitling and voice-over descriptions for asynchronous content, and sign language interpretation and
real time captioning for live classes. 
 State Authorization Services.  Each online program we enable for a client
must comply with state authorization requirements in each state where the students enrolled in the program reside. We work with most of our clients to identify and satisfy state authorization
requirements. 
 Immersion Support.  Many of our client programs require students to attend
immersions and intensive residencies where students travel to a client's physical campus and other locations, where they can engage in collaborative learning experiences with their classmates and
professors, and develop invaluable personal and professional relationships. We provide the resources and technology to support our clients in facilitating these experiences. 

 8



 Faculty Recruiting.  With our solutions our clients can identify and employ
highly qualified teaching faculty without geographic constraint. We effectively act as a search firm for our clients, attracting, cultivating and vetting a pool of faculty candidates for our clients.
Our clients make all faculty hiring decisions, but we support them in creating a broader pool of potential faculty than they could on their own. 

 Benefits of Using Our Solutions 
         Using our solutions, our clients can: 
 

 Extend Institutional Mission and
Reach.  Extend their brands and fulfill their missions by delivering high-quality education programs online to students anywhere in the world
while maintaining their academic rigor and admissions standards. Our clients are able to reach students who otherwise may not have been able to enroll in their programs, thereby furthering their
marketplace recognition and extending their institutional presence beyond geographic limitations. 
 Increase Revenue.  Increase their
overall enrollments significantly, thereby growing their tuition revenue. Students who enroll in the programs we enable generally pay the same tuition as on-campus students. 
 Increase Scalability.  Extend
beyond their physical boundaries and capacity constraints to scale programs without the investment typically required to acquire, educate and service incremental on-campus students. Our clients can
focus on providing high quality, rigorous education at scale without needing to address the increased operational complexity related to delivering online education to students anywhere in the world. 
 Deliver a Differentiated, Engaging Learning
Environment.  Leverage advanced software technology to enable highly interactive learning experiences through Online Campus. Instructors are able
to lead live, intimate discussions in seminar-style classes with an average of 12 students per session. Students are able to access Online Campus using proprietary web-based and mobile applications
and engage with rich, multimedia-based educational content. We believe that this dynamic, interactive learning environment is more engaging and impactful than traditional educational environments or
other approaches to online education, encouraging students to remain in our clients' programs through graduation. 
 Utilize Ongoing Data and Analytical
Insight.  Track the engagement and learning outcomes of their online students to a significantly greater degree than for their on-campus students.
Through our analytics and reporting functions, clients can follow key data related to asynchronous student participation, class attendance, homework submission and overall engagement, and can provide
timely intervention or support services as appropriate. This helps clients improve learning outcomes for their students. 
 Increase Speed to
Market.  Implement and scale an online degree program faster than they could on their own. We work closely with our clients' faculty to develop
engaging asynchronous multimedia course content, and apply our sophisticated digital marketing expertise to attract potential students for our clients' programs. Our clients do not need to spend time
installing servers, networking equipment or other infrastructure to ensure a scalable, reliable program offering. 

 Technology 
         Our cloud-based SaaS technology is designed to deliver an exceptional end-user experience in a secure environment. To increase the speed at which we develop and enhance our solutions, we use 
 9

   open-source technology and custom development of our own instructional design tools and learning components. 
         Our technology stack resides completely in the cloud, with a high level of security and horizontal scalability. We work with Amazon Web Services, our cloud hosting provider, to ensure high levels of redundancy and general preparedness. We have the ability to manage hundreds of server instances in Amazon Web Services and elsewhere through our automated deployment technologies. 
         Our application programming interface, or API, is at the core of all of our SaaS technology providing a standardized way to provision, manage, engage and deliver content to students, faculty and administrators. The API supports advanced analytics that allow us to search and analyze student usage data to evaluate course content, inform continuous technology development and improve user experiences. The API manages authentication and access for our entire technology stack and is designed to manage and interface with new technologies as they are introduced. 
         Our development process follows best practices in web security, including formal design reviews by operations security consultants, threat modeling and risk assessments. All deployed software undergoes recurring penetration testing performed by certified industry experts. Our security risk assessment reviews begin during the design phase and continue through ongoing operations. 
         All of the applications and application components within our SaaS technology are designed from the ground up to produce significant, readable and interpretable data to centralized systems in the form of monitors and logs that allow us to proactively identify and mitigate potential capacity, performance and security issues. We design our SaaS technology to industry security standards as well as requirements set out in current applicable regulations and standards. 
   New Program Pipeline 
         We dedicate the bulk of our program marketing and sales efforts to acquiring students for our clients' programs, and have developed highly sophisticated internet-based program marketing and student acquisition capabilities. However, we do maintain a small sales team targeted at new client or program acquisition. Our new clients and programs are largely generated through a direct approach to selected colleges and universities and we use a proprietary program selection algorithm to develop our pipeline of target programs based on a combination of degree vertical, college or university and geographic region. This data-centric model uses internally generated, publicly available and purchased data on degree vertical size, selectivity, student demographics, competition and other factors to identify opportunities we believe will have the best prospects of long-term success. 
 Clients 
         Our clients are leading nonprofit colleges and universities who primarily use our solution to offer full graduate degree programs online. We have grown our client and program base significantly since our inception from one client with one program in 2008 to 17 clients with 38 programs today. A full listing of all 38 announced programs can be found at investor.2u.com. Through our uncompromising focus on quality and deep understanding of the higher education environment, we believe we have become not only a valued provider of the technology and services our clients use to implement and manage their critical online education operations, but also a trusted steward of their brands. We currently have announced long-term client contracts with 17 universities and colleges to operate a total 
 10

   of 38 programs. At the end of 2016, we had launched 24 programs in 17 different degree verticals. In 2017, we plan to launch the following ten programs: 

   
University/School | Program Name | Expected Program Launch Date
The George Washington UniversityMilken Institute School of Public Health | HealthInformatics@GW | January 2017 
Syracuse UniversityMaxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs | ExecutiveMPA@Syracuse | July 2017 
University of Southern CaliforniaJimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation | Design@USC | August 2017 
Vanderbilt UniversityPeabody College of Education and Human Development | Peabody Online | September 2017 
Pepperdine UniversitySchool of Law | Law@Pepperdine | September 2017 
New York UniversitySteinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development | OT@NYU | September 2017 
New York UniversitySteinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development | Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness | September 2017 
Syracuse University | DataScience@Syracuse | October 2017 
University of DaytonSchool of Business Administration | MBA@Dayton | October 2017 
Pepperdine UniversityGraduate School of Education and Psychology | Psychology@Pepperdine | October 2017 


        Our long-term client contracts do not include termination rights for convenience. Most contracts impose liquidated damages for a client's non-renewal, unless the client otherwise terminates due to our uncured breach. Each of our clients owns all of the academic content that we help them develop, although we are generally not obligated to develop content that will be functional anywhere but within Online Campus. 
         Our contracts also set forth the parties' respective rights to offer competitive programs. For example, some contracts permit us to offer competitive programs with other schools whose potential students are not academically qualified or otherwise interested in the program we offer with our client. Other contracts prohibit us from offering competitive programs with a specific list of schools, whether a certain number as listed on U.S. News & World Report's "best" schools list or a specifically enumerated list of schools negotiated with our client. In addition, any limitation on our ability to offer competitive programs becomes inapplicable if a client either refuses to scale the program to accommodate all students qualifying for admission into the program, or raises the program admissions standards above those at the time of contract execution. In addition, our contracts generally prohibit our clients from offering any online competitive program. Most of our more recent contracts either do not restrict our ability to offer competitive programs or provide for only limited restrictions. 
         Our two longest running programs, launched in 2009 and 2010, are with the University of Southern California, or USC. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 34% and 43%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from these two programs. We expect that these programs will continue to account for a large portion of our revenue until our other client programs become more mature and achieve significantly higher enrollment levels. 
         We have a contract with the USC Rossier School of Education, or Rossier, to enable various education programs, including a Master of Arts in Teaching program, or MAT program, a Doctor of 
 11

   Education program and a Master of Education in School Counseling program. We also have contracts with the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work to enable both a Master of Social Work (MSW) program and a Master of Nursing program. We amended our contract with Rossier in April 2016 and our contract with the School of Social Work for the MSW program in November 2015. Under the terms of each amended contract, the initial terms expire on June 30, 2030, we are entitled to a specified percentage of the net program proceeds, which is reduced over time, and we agreed to provide fixed and contingent cash payments over time. 
         Both contracts provide for automatic renewal for successive three-year terms unless either party gives one-year notice of non-renewal, and liquidated damages if Rossier or the School of Social Work, as the case may be, fails to renew its respective contract after any term. 
         Our programs with Simmons College accounted for 18% and 16% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our programs with the University of North Carolina accounted for 11% and 12% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   Competition 
         The overall market for technology solutions that enable higher education providers to deliver education online is highly fragmented, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology, shifting needs of students and educators and frequent introductions of new methods of delivering education online. Several competitors provide solutions that compete with some of the capabilities of our solutions. Two such competitors, EmbanetCompass and Deltak, were acquired in 2012 by Pearson and John Wiley & Sons, respectively, both of which are large education and publishing companies. There are also several private companies, including HotChalk and Everspring Partners, providing some or all of the services we provide, and these companies may choose to pursue some of the institutions we target. In addition, nonprofit colleges and universities may elect to continue using or develop their own online learning solutions in-house. 
         We expect that the competitive landscape will expand as the market for online programs at nonprofit institutions matures. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
 

 brand awareness and reputation; 
 ability of online programs to deliver desired student outcomes; 
 robustness and evolution of technology offering; 
 breadth and depth of service offering; 
 ability to invest in launching and operating programs; 
 expertise in program marketing, student acquisition and student retention; 
 quality of user experience; 
 ease of deployment and use of solutions; 
 level of customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability and reliability of solutions; and 
 quality of client base and track record of performance. 

         We believe we compete favorably on the basis of these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will depend, to a great extent, upon our ability to consistently deliver high-quality technology solutions, 
 12

   meet client needs for content development, and acquire, support and retain students who achieve high-quality outcomes. 
   Intellectual Property 
         We protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patent applications and contractual agreements. For example, we rely on trademark protection in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to various marks, including 2U, NO BACK ROW, and other distinctive logos associated with our brand. We also have two patent applications pending in the United States, which are directed to computer-implemented processes that facilitate asynchronous student responses to teacher questions. 
         We ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by signing agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, companies, and any other third party that creates intellectual property for us that assign any intellectual property rights to us. 
         Portions of our solutions rely upon third-party licensed intellectual property. 
         We have also established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which we conduct business. 
         We continue to evaluate developing and expanding our intellectual property rights in patents, trademarks and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally. 
         For important additional information related to our intellectual property position, please review the information set forth in "Risk FactorsRisks Related to Intellectual Property." 
   Education Laws and Regulations 
         The higher education industry is heavily regulated. Institutions of higher education that award degrees and certificates to signify the successful completion of an academic program are subject to regulation from three primary entities: the U.S. Department of Education, or DOE, accrediting agencies and state licensing authorities. Each of these entities promulgates and enforces its own laws, regulations and standards, which we refer to collectively as education laws. 
         We contract with postsecondary institutions that are subject to education laws. In addition, we ourselves are required to comply with certain education laws as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions of higher education, either directly or indirectly through our contractual arrangements with clients. Our failure, or that of our clients, to comply with education laws could adversely impact our operations. As a result, we work closely with our clients to maintain compliance with education laws. 
   Federal Laws and Regulations 
         Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or the HEA, institutions offering postsecondary education must comply with certain laws and related regulations promulgated by the DOE in order to participate in the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs. All of our clients participate in the Title IV programs. 
         The HEA and the regulations promulgated thereunder are frequently revised, repealed or expanded. Congress historically has reauthorized and amended the HEA in regular intervals, approximately every five to seven years. The re-authorization process is currently under way. 
         The re-authorization of the HEA could alter the regulatory landscape of the higher education industry, and thereby impact the manner in which we conduct business and serve our clients. In 
 13

   addition, the DOE is independently conducting an ongoing series of rulemakings intended to assure the integrity of the Title IV programs. The DOE also frequently issues formal and informal guidance instructing institutions of higher education and other covered entities how to comply with various federal laws and regulations. DOE guidance is subject to frequent change and may impact our business model. 
         Although we are not considered an institution of higher education and we do not directly participate in Title IV programs, we are required to comply with certain regulations promulgated by the DOE as a result of our role as a service provider to institutions that do participate in Title IV programs. These include, for example, regulations governing student privacy under Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA. The most material obligations stem from new rules and revisions to existing regulations promulgated by the DOE in 2010 as part of the so-called "program integrity" rules. 
         While the program integrity rules were targeted at for-profit institutions of higher education, most apply equally to traditional colleges and universities such as our clients, and they apply in particular to institutions contracting with outside vendors to provide services, particularly in connection with distance education. These rules include principally the incentive compensation rule, the misrepresentation rule, the written arrangements rules and state authorization requirements. The more significant program integrity rules applicable to us or our clients are discussed in further detail below. 
   Incentive Compensation Rule 
         The HEA provides that any institution that participates in the Title IV federal student financial assistance programs must agree with the DOE that the institution will not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities. 
         As part of the program integrity rules, the DOE issued revised regulations regarding incentive compensation effective July 1, 2011. Under the revised regulations, each higher education institution agrees that it will not "provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid, to any person or entity who is engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity, or in making decisions regarding the award of title IV, HEA program funds." Pursuant to this rule, we are prohibited from offering our covered employees, which are those involved with or responsible for recruiting or admissions activities, any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the successful recruitment, admission or enrollment of students into a postsecondary institution. 
         In addition, the revised rule initially raised a question as to whether our company itself, as an entity, is prohibited from entering into tuition revenue-sharing arrangements with clients. On March 17, 2011, the DOE issued official agency guidance, known as a "Dear Colleague Letter," or the DCL, providing guidance on this point. The DCL states that "[t]he Department generally views payment based on the amount of tuition generated as an indirect payment of incentive compensation based on success in recruitment and therefore a prohibited basis upon which to measure the value of the services provided" and that "[t]his is true regardless of the manner in which the entity compensates its employees." But the DCL also provides an important exception to the ban on tuition revenue-sharing arrangements between institutions and third parties. According to the DCL, the DOE does not consider payment based on the amount of tuition generated by an institution to violate the incentive compensation ban if the payment compensates an "unaffiliated third party" that provides a set of "bundled services" that includes recruitment services, such as those we provide. Example 2-B in the DCL is described as a "possible business model" developed "with the statutory mandate in mind." Example 2-B describes the following as a possible business model: 
 
"A
third party that is not affiliated with the institution it serves and is not affiliated with any other institution that provides educational services, provides bundled services to the institution
including 

 14

   
marketing,
enrollment application assistance, recruitment services, course support for online delivery of courses, the provision of technology, placement services for internships, and student career
counseling. The institution may pay the entity an amount based on tuition generated for the institution by the entity's activities for all the bundled services that are offered and provided
collectively, as long as the entity does not make prohibited compensation payments to its employees, and the institution does not pay the entity separately for student recruitment services provided by
the entity." 

         The DCL guidance indicates that an arrangement that complies with Example 2-B will be deemed to be in compliance with the incentive compensation provisions of the HEA and the DOE's regulations. Our business model and contractual arrangements with client institutions closely follow Example 2-B in the DCL. In addition, we assure that none of our "covered employees" is paid any bonus or other incentive compensation in violation of the rule. 
         Because the bundled services rule was promulgated in the form of agency guidance issued by the DOE in the form of a DCL and is not codified by statute or regulation, the rule could be altered or removed without prior notice, public comment period or other administrative procedural requirements that accompany formal agency rulemaking. Similarly, a court could invalidate the rule in an action involving our company or our clients, or in action that does not involve us at all. The revision, removal or invalidation of the bundled services rule by Congress, the DOE or a court could require us to change our business model. 
   Misrepresentation Rule 
         The HEA prohibits an institution that participates in the Title IV programs from engaging in any "substantial misrepresentation" regarding three broad subject areas: (1) the nature of the school's education programs, (2) the school's financial charges and (3) the employability of the school's graduates. In 2010, as part of the program integrity rules, the DOE revised its regulations in order to significantly expand the scope of the misrepresentation rule. Although some of the DOE's most expansive amendments to the misrepresentation rule were overturned by the courts in 2012, most of the 2010 amendments survived and remain in effect. 
         Under the new rule, "misrepresentation" is defined as any false, erroneous or misleading statement, written, visual or oral. This includes even statements that "have the likelihood or tendency to deceive." Therefore, a statement need not be intentionally deceitful to qualify as a misrepresentation. "Substantial misrepresentation" is defined loosely as a misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment. 
         The new regulation also expands the scope of the rule to cover statements made by any representative of an institution, including agents, employees and subcontractors, and statements made directly or indirectly to any third party, including state agencies, government officials or the public, and not just to students or prospective students. 
         Violations of the misrepresentation rule are subject to various sanctions by the DOE and violations may be used as a basis for legal action by third parties. Similar rules apply under state laws or are incorporated in institutional accreditation standards and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) applies similar rules prohibiting any unfair or deceptive marketing practices to the education sector. As a result, we and our employees and subcontractors, as agents of our clients, must use a high degree of care to comply with such rules and are prohibited by contract from making any false, erroneous or misleading statements about our clients. To avoid an issue under the misrepresentation rule and similar rules, we assure that all marketing materials are approved in advance by our clients before they are used by our employees and we carefully monitor our subcontractors. 
 15

     Accreditation Rules and Standards 
         Accrediting agencies primarily examine the academic quality of the instructional programs of an educational institution, and a grant of accreditation is typically viewed as confirmation that an institution or an institution's programs meet generally accepted academic standards. Accrediting agencies also review the administrative and financial operations of the institutions they accredit to ensure that each institution has the resources to perform its educational mission. The DOE also relies on accrediting agencies to determine whether institutions' educational programs qualify the institutions to participate in Title IV programs. 
         In addition to institutional accreditation, colleges and universities may require specialized programmatic accreditation for particular educational programs. Many states and professional associations require professional programs to be accredited, and require individuals to have graduated from accredited programs in order to sit for professional license exams. Programmatic accreditation, while not a sufficient basis for institutional Title IV Program certification by the DOE, assists graduates to practice or otherwise secure appropriate employment in their chosen field. Common fields of study subject to programmatic accreditation include teaching and nursing. 
         Although we are not an accredited institution and are not required to maintain accreditation, accrediting agencies are responsible for reviewing an accredited institution's third-party contracts with service providers like us and may require an institution to obtain approval from or to notify the accreditor in connection with such arrangements. One purpose of the notification and approval requirements is to verify that the accredited institution remains responsible for providing academic instruction leading to a credential and provides oversight of other activities undertaken by third parties like us that are within the scope of its accreditation. We work closely with our clients to assure that the standards of their respective accreditors are met and are not adversely impacted by us. 
         Accrediting agencies are also responsible for assuring that any "written arrangements" to outsource academic instruction meet accrediting standards and related regulations of the DOE. Our operations are generally not subject to such "written arrangements" rules because academic instruction is provided by our client institutions and not by us. 
   State Laws and Regulations 
         Each state has at least one licensing agency responsible for the oversight of educational institutions operating within its jurisdiction. Continued approval by such agencies is necessary for an institution to operate and grant degrees, diplomas or certificates in those states. Moreover, under the HEA, approval by such agencies is necessary to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. State attorneys general are also active in enforcing education laws, and the level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state. 
         We and our clients may be subject to regulation in each state in which we or they own facilities, provide distance education or recruit students. State laws establish standards for, among other things, student instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities, recruiting practices and financial policies. The need to comply with applicable state laws and regulations may limit or delay our ability to market programs or offer new degree programs of our clients. 
         State regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent between states, change frequently and, in some instances, are outmoded. In addition, the interpretation of state authorization regulations is subject to substantial discretion by the state agency responsible for enforcing the regulations. Some states have enacted legislation or issued regulations that specifically address online educational programs, some of which may affect our operations. 
         As part of the program integrity rules, the DOE required, among other things, that an institution offering distance learning or online programs secure the approval of those states which require such 
 16

   approval and provide evidence of such approval to the DOE upon request. This regulation dramatically increased the importance of state authorization because failure to obtain it could result in an obligation to return federal funds received by an institution. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down the regulations requiring proof of state approval for online education programs in 2012 on procedural grounds; however, the DOE promulgated similar replacement regulations in December 2016, with an effective date of July 1, 2018. However, it is the policy of DOE to require proof of all necessary state approvals when an institution seeks to renew its authorization to participate in the Title IV programs. 
         We monitor state law developments closely and work closely with our clients to assist them with obtaining any required approvals. 
   Other Laws 
         Our activities on behalf of institutions are also subject to other federal and state laws. These regulations include, but are not limited to, consumer marketing and unfair trade practices laws and regulations, including those promulgated and enforced by the FTC, as well as federal and state data protection and privacy requirements. 
 Employees 
         As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,119 full-time employees and 90 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 
 Facilities 
         Our headquarters are located in Lanham, Maryland where we occupy approximately 153,000 square feet under a lease that expires in 2028. We also currently lease approximately 94,000 square feet in Landover, Maryland, in connection with our former corporate headquarters, which expires in July, 2018. 
         In February 2017, we signed a lease for new office space in Brooklyn, New York, which we expect to occupy in 2018 after we vacate our current offices in New York City. The lease covers three floors totaling approximately 80,000 square feet and will expire approximately eleven years and nine months after the lease commencement date. We expect that the new space will allow us to accommodate our growth in the local area. 
         We also currently lease an aggregate of approximately 114,000 square feet of space in New York, California, Colorado, North Carolina, Virginia and Hong Kong. We believe that our current facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our ongoing needs and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms. 
   Legal Proceedings 
         From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any material legal proceedings, nor are we a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.

 Risks Related to Our Business Model, Our Operations and Our Growth Strategy 
   We have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to predict our future financial and operating results, and we may not achieve our expected financial and operating results in the future. 
         We were incorporated in 2008 and launched our first client program in 2009. As a result of our limited operating history, our ability to forecast our future operating results, including revenue, cash flows and profitability, is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties. We have encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in the technology industry. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change due to factors impacting our targeted markets, or if we do not manage these risks successfully, our operating and financial results may differ materially from our expectations and our business may suffer. 
   We have incurred significant net losses since inception, and we expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, which may make it more difficult for us to achieve and maintain profitability. 
         We incurred net losses of $20.7 million, $26.7 million and $29.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we undertake increased technology and production efforts to support a growing number of client programs and increase our program marketing and sales efforts to drive the acquisition of potential students in these programs. In addition, as a public company, we will continue to incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. These expenditures will make it harder for us to achieve and maintain profitability. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. If we are forced to reduce our expenses, our growth strategy could be compromised. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events. As a result, we can provide no assurance as to whether or when we will achieve profitability. If we are not able to achieve and maintain profitability, the value of our company and our common stock could decline significantly. 
 18

     Our business depends heavily on the adoption by colleges and universities of online delivery of their programs. If we fail to attract new colleges and universities as clients, our revenue growth and profitability may suffer. 
         The success of our business depends in large part on our ability to enter into agreements with additional nonprofit colleges and universities for their offering of degree programs online. In particular, to engage new clients, we need to convince nonprofit colleges and universities, many of which have been educating students in generally the same types of on-campus programs for hundreds of years, to invest significant time and resources to adjust the manner in which they teach students for an online degree program. The delivery of degree-granting programs online at leading nonprofit colleges and universities is nascent, and many administrators and faculty members have expressed concern regarding the perceived loss of control over the education process that might result from offering content online, as well as skepticism regarding the ability of colleges and universities to provide high-quality education online that maintains the standards they set for their on-campus programs. It may be difficult to overcome this resistance, and there can be no assurance that online programs of the kind we develop with our clients will ever achieve significant market acceptance. 
   Our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to acquire qualified potential students for our clients' programs, and our ability to do so may be affected by circumstances beyond our control. 
         Building awareness of our clients' programs is critical to our ability to acquire prospective students for our clients' programs and generate revenue. A substantial portion of our expenses is attributable to program marketing and sales efforts dedicated to attracting potential students to our clients' programs. Because we generate revenue based on a portion of the tuition and fees that our clients bill to the students enrolled in their programs, it is critical to our success that we identify prospective students who meet our clients' admissions criteria in a cost-effective manner, and that enrolled students remain active in our clients' programs. 
         The following factors, many of which are largely outside of our control, may prevent us from successfully driving and maintaining student enrollment in our clients' programs in a cost-effective manner or at all: 
 

 Negative perceptions about online learning programs.  As a non-traditional
form of education delivery, prospective students will subject our clients' online degree programs to increased scrutiny. Online learning programs that we or our competitors offer may not be successful
or operate efficiently, and new entrants to the field of online learning also may not perform well. Such underperformance could create the perception that online programs in general are not an
effective way to educate students, whether or not our clients' programs achieve satisfactory performance, which could make it difficult for us to successfully attract prospective students for our
clients' programs. Students may be reluctant to enroll in online programs for fear that the learning experience may be substandard, that employers may be averse to hiring students who received their
education online, or that organizations granting professional licenses or certifications may be reluctant to grant them based on degrees earned through online education. 
 Ineffective program marketing efforts.  We invest substantial resources in
developing and implementing data-driven program marketing strategies that focus on identifying the right potential student at the right time. Our program marketing efforts make substantial use of
search engine optimization, paid search and custom website development and deployment and we rely on a small number of internet search engines and marketing partners. If our execution of this strategy
proves to be inefficient or unsuccessful in generating a sufficient quantity of high-quality prospective students, or if the costs associated with the execution of this strategy increase, our revenue
could be adversely affected. 
 Damage to client reputation.  Because we market a specific client degree
program to potential students, the reputations of our clients are critical to our ability to enroll students. Many factors affecting our clients' reputations are beyond our control and can change over
time, including 

 19

   

their
academic performance and ranking among nonprofit educational institutions offering a particular degree program. 


 Lack of interest in the degree offered by the program.  We may encounter
difficulties attracting qualified students for degree programs that are not highly desired or that are relatively new within their fields. Macroeconomic conditions beyond our control may diminish
interest in employment in a field, and that could contribute to lack of interest in degrees in the disciplines offered by our clients. 
 Our lack of control over our clients' admissions decisions.  Even if we are
able to identity prospective students for a program, there is no guarantee that students will be admitted to that program. Our clients retain complete discretion in their admissions decisions, and any
changes to admissions standards, or inconsistent application of admissions standards, could affect student enrollment and our ability to generate revenue. 
 Inability of students to secure funding.  Like traditional college and
university students, many of the students in our clients' programs rely heavily on the availability of third-party financing to pay for the costs of their educations, including tuition. This tuition
assistance may include federal or private student loans, scholarships and grants, or benefits or reimbursement provided by the students' employers. Any developments that reduce the availability of
financial aid for higher education generally, or for our clients' programs in particular, could impair students' abilities to meet their financial obligations, which in turn could result in reduced
enrollment and harm our ability to generate revenue. 
 General economic conditions.  Student enrollment in our clients' programs
may be affected by changes in the U.S. economy and, to a lesser extent, by global economic conditions. An improvement in economic conditions in the United States and, in particular, an improvement in
the U.S. unemployment rate, may reduce demand among potential students for higher educational services, as they may find adequate employment without additional education. Conversely, a worsening of
economic and employment conditions may reduce the willingness of employers to sponsor higher educational opportunities for their employees or discourage existing or potential students from pursuing
higher education due to a perception that there are insufficient job opportunities, increased economic uncertainty or other factors, any of which could adversely impact our ability to attract
qualified students to our clients' programs. If one or more of these factors reduces student demand for our clients' programs, enrollment could be negatively affected, our costs associated with
student acquisition and retention could increase, or both, any of which could materially compromise our ability to grow our revenue or achieve profitability. These developments could also harm our
reputation and make it more difficult for us to engage additional clients for new programs, which would negatively impact our ability to expand our business. 

   Disruption to or failures of our SaaS technology could reduce client and student satisfaction with our clients' programs and could harm our reputation. 
         The performance and reliability of our SaaS technology is critical to our operations, reputation and ability to attract new clients, as well as our student acquisition and retention efforts. Our clients rely on this technology to offer their programs online, and students access this technology on a frequent basis as an important part of their educational experience. Accordingly, any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our SaaS technology could damage our or our clients' reputations, decrease student satisfaction and retention and impact our ability to attract new students and clients. If any of these problems occur, our clients may, following notice and our failure to cure, terminate their agreements with us, or make indemnification or other claims against us. In addition, sustained or recurring disruptions in our SaaS technology could adversely affect our and our clients' compliance with applicable regulations and accrediting body standards. 
 20

     Our market may be limited based on the types of nonprofit colleges and universities we target for online degree programs. 
         We primarily market our integrated solution to selective nonprofit colleges and universities, a market that is necessarily limited. Some of the contracts we enter into with our clients contain limitations on our ability to contract with other institutions to offer the same degree program, and maintaining good relations with our clients may mean that we may be less likely to approach certain institutions that they regard as their direct competitors to offer similar programs, even if we are allowed to do so under our contracts. Moreover, because of the long-term nature of our client contracts, and because of the relationships of trust we strive to build with our current clients, we generally will not be able or willing to terminate our existing client relationships to pursue a competitive program with another college or university, even if it may prove to be more profitable to us. Instead, we may continue with a program that does not generate expected levels of revenue to us, or one from which we may not be able to fully recover the program marketing and sales expenses we incur in attracting students to enroll in the program, if, for example, the client limits enrollment in the program. As a result, the nature of our contracts and our relationships with our clients could restrict the overall revenue potential of our business. 
   We have agreed to incur, and we may incur in the future, costs to terminate some or all of the exclusivity obligations in certain of our client contracts. 
         Certain of our client contracts limit our ability to enable competitive programs with other schools. We have determined that enabling some of these contractually prohibited competitive programs may be part of our business strategy. To eliminate some or all of the exclusivity obligations in certain clients' contracts with us, we have agreed with certain clients to do some or all of the following: make fixed and contingent cash payments over time, reduce our revenue share over time, and/or make minimum investments in marketing under certain conditions. 
         We may determine in the future that enabling additional contractually prohibited competitive programs is desirable, and we may therefore agree with additional clients to incur costs similar to those above to reduce or eliminate the exclusivity obligations contained in their contracts with us. 
         If the competitive programs we ultimately enable fail to reach scale or cannot be scaled at a reasonable cost, or if we need to incur contingent costs in connection with our offering of competitive programs, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability would be impaired. 
   Our clients may disagree with our decision to offer competitive programs under the contracts we have with them. 
         Our contracts with our clients include terms addressing the parties' respective rights to offer competitive programs. For example, some of our contracts permit us to offer competitive programs with other schools whose potential students are not academically qualified or otherwise interested in the program we offer with that client. Some of our other contracts prohibit us from offering competitive programs with specific schools. In addition, any contract limitations on our ability to offer competitive programs are inapplicable if our client either refuses to scale the program to accommodate all students qualifying for admission into the program, or raises the program admissions standards above those described in the contract at the time it was executed. If we elect to offer competitive programs in reliance on these contractual provisions, our clients may disagree with our interpretation of those provisions or with our interpretation of the facts surrounding our decision to offer a competitive program. Any disagreement with our clients over our decision to offer competitive programs could result in claims for breach of contract and equitable relief, and could cause damage to our reputation and impair our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability. 
 21

     Attracting new clients for the launch of new programs is complex and time-consuming. If we pursue unsuccessful client opportunities, we may forego more profitable opportunities and our operating results and growth would be harmed. 
         The process of identifying specific degree programs at the selective nonprofit colleges and universities, and then negotiating contracts with potential clients, is complex and time-consuming. Because of the initial reluctance on the part of some nonprofit colleges and universities to embrace a new method of delivering their education services and the complicated approval process within universities, our sales process to attract and engage a new client can be lengthy. Depending on the particular college or university, we may face resistance from university administrators or faculty members during the process. 
         The sales cycle for a new degree program often spans one year or longer. In addition, our sales cycle can vary substantially from program to program because of a number of factors, including the client's approval processes or disagreements over the terms of our offerings. We spend substantial effort and management resources on our new program sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will result in the launch of a new program. If we invest substantial resources pursuing unsuccessful program opportunities, we may forego other more profitable client relationships, which would harm our operating results and growth. 
   To launch a new program, we must incur significant expense in technology and content development, as well as program marketing and sales, to identify and attract prospective students, and it may be several years, if ever, before we generate revenue from a new program sufficient to recover our costs. 
         To launch a new program, we must integrate components of our solutions with the various student information and other operating systems our clients use to manage functions within their institutions. In addition, our content development staff must work closely with that client's faculty members to produce engaging online coursework and content, and we must commence student acquisition activities. This process of launching a new program is time-consuming and costly and, under our agreements with our clients, we are primarily responsible for the significant costs of this effort, even before we generate any revenue. Additionally, during the life of our client agreements, we are responsible for the costs associated with continued program marketing, maintaining our SaaS technology and providing non-academic and other support for students enrolled in the program. We invest significant resources in these new programs from the beginning of our relationship with a client, and there is no guarantee that we will ever recoup these costs. 
         Because our client agreements provide that we receive a fixed percentage of the tuition that the clients receive from the students enrolled in their programs, we only begin to recover these costs once students are enrolled and our clients begin billing students for tuition and fees. The time that it takes for us to recover our investment in a new program depends on a variety of factors, primarily the level of our student acquisition costs and the rate of growth in student enrollment in the program. We estimate that, on average, it takes approximately four to five years after engagement with a client to fully recover our investment in that client's new program. Because of the lengthy period required to recoup our investment in a program, unexpected developments beyond our control could occur that result in the client ceasing or significantly curtailing a program before we are able to fully recoup our investment. As a result, we may ultimately be unable to recover the full investment that we make in a new program or achieve our expected level of profitability for the program. 
   If new programs do not scale efficiently and in the time frames we expect, our reputation and our revenue will suffer. 
         Our continued growth and profitability depends on our and our clients' ability to successfully scale newly launched programs. As we continue aggressively growing our business, we plan to continue to hire new employees at a rapid pace, particularly in our program marketing and sales team and our 
 22

   technology and content development teams. If we cannot adequately train these new employees, we may not be successful in acquiring potential students for our clients' programs, which would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue, and our clients and the students in their programs could lose confidence in the knowledge and capability of our employees. If we cannot quickly and efficiently scale our technology to handle growing student enrollment and new client programs, our clients' and their students' experiences may suffer, which could damage our reputation among colleges and universities and their faculty and students. 
         In addition, if our clients cannot quickly develop the infrastructure and hire sufficient faculty and administrators to handle growing student enrollments, our clients' and their students' experiences with our solutions may suffer, which could damage our reputation among colleges and universities and their faculty and students. 
         Our ability to effectively manage any significant growth of new programs and increasing student enrollment will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:
 

 satisfy existing students in, and attract and enroll new students for, our clients' programs; 
 assist our clients in recruiting qualified faculty to support their expanding enrollments; 
 assist our clients in developing and producing an increased volume of course content; 
 successfully introduce new features and enhancements and maintain a high level of functionality in our SaaS technology; and 
 deliver high-quality support to our clients and their faculty and students. 

         Establishing new client programs or expanding existing programs will require us to make investments in management and key staff, increase capital expenditures, incur additional marketing expenses and reallocate other resources. If student enrollment in our clients' programs does not increase, if we are unable to launch new programs in a cost-effective manner or if we are otherwise unable to manage new client programs effectively, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability would be impaired, and the quality of our solutions and the satisfaction of our clients and their students could suffer. 
   Our financial performance depends heavily on student retention within our clients' programs, and factors influencing student retention may be out of our control. 
         Once a student is enrolled in a program, we and our client must retain the student over the life of the degree program to generate ongoing revenue. Our strategy involves offering high-quality support to students enrolled in our clients' programs to support their retention. If we do not help students quickly resolve any educational, technological or logistical issues they encounter, otherwise provide effective ongoing support to students or deliver the type of high-quality, engaging educational content that students expect, students may withdraw from the program, which would negatively impact our revenue. 
         In addition, student retention could be compromised by the following factors, many of which are largely outside of our control: 
 

 Reduced support from our clients.  Because revenue from a particular program
is directly attributable to the level of student enrollment in the program, our ability to grow our revenue from a client relationship depends on the client continuing to offer its online program to
students, as well as the growth of enrollment in that program. Although our contracts with clients generally require that the client expand enrollment in their programs to include all qualified
applicants, our only recourse if they choose not to do so is termination of the exclusivity limitations on developing programs with other colleges or universities that are included in our agreements
with our clients. Despite the agreements we have in place with our clients, our clients could limit enrollment in their programs, cease providing the programs 

 23

   

altogether
or significantly curtail or inhibit our ability to promote their programs, any of which would negatively impact our revenue. 


 Lack of support from client faculty members.  It takes a significant time
commitment and dedication from our clients' faculty members to work with us to develop course content designed for an online learning environment. Our clients' faculty may be unfamiliar with the
development and production process, may not understand the time commitment involved to develop the course content, or may otherwise be resistant to changing the ways in which they present the same
content in an on-campus class. Our ability to maintain high student retention will depend in part on our ability to convince our clients' faculty of the value in the time and effort they will spend
developing the course program. Lack of support from faculty could cause the quality of our clients' programs to decline, which could contribute to decreased student satisfaction and retention. 
 Student dissatisfaction.  Enrolled students may drop out of our clients'
programs based on their individual perceptions of the value they are getting from the program. For example, we may face retention challenges as a result of students' dissatisfaction with the quality
of course content and presentation, dissatisfaction with our clients' faculty, changing views of the value of our clients' programs and degrees offered and perceptions of employment prospects
following completion of the program. Factors outside our control related to student satisfaction with, and overall perception of, a program may contribute to decreased student retention rates for that
program. 
 Personal factors.  Factors impacting a student's willingness and ability to
stay enrolled in a program include personal factors, such as ability to continue to pay tuition, ability to meet the rigorous demands of the program, and lack of time to continue classes, all of which
are generally beyond our control. 

         Any of these factors could significantly reduce the revenue that we generate from a program, which would negatively impact our return on investment for the particular program, and could compromise our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability. 
   We currently have, and for the foreseeable future expect to continue to have, a small number of programs that contribute a meaningful portion of our revenue and generate positive earnings and cash flow. Therefore we expect that the loss, or material underperformance, of any one of these programs could hurt our future financial performance. 
         Of the programs we operate, only a small number contribute a significant portion of our revenue and generate positive earnings and cash flow. As a result, the material underperformance of any one of these programs could have a disproportionate effect on our business. 
   A significant portion of our revenue is currently attributable to programs with the University of Southern California. The loss of, or a decline in enrollment in, either of these programs could significantly reduce our revenue. 
         Our two longest running programs, launched in 2009 and 2010, are with the University of Southern California, or USC. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, 34% and 43%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from these two programs. We expect that these programs will continue to account for a large portion of our revenue until our other client programs become more mature and achieve significantly higher enrollment levels. Any decline in USC's reputation, any increase in USC's tuition, or any changes in USC's policies could adversely affect the number of students that enroll in these two programs. Further, the faculty or administrators of these two schools could become resistant to offering their online programs through our solutions, making it more difficult for us to attract and retain students. These graduate schools are not required to expand student enrollment in their online programs and, upon the expiration of their contracts, they are not required to continue using us as the 
 24

   provider of their online programs. If either of these programs were to materially underperform for any reason or to terminate or not renew their relationships with us, it would significantly reduce our revenue. 
   The loss, or material underperformance, of any one of our programs could harm our reputation, which could in turn affect our profitability. 
         We rely on our reputation for delivering high-quality online programs and recommendations from existing clients to attract potential new clients. Therefore, the loss of any single client program, or the failure of any client to renew its agreement with us upon expiration, could harm our reputation and impair our ability to pursue our growth strategy and ultimately to become profitable. 
   If our security measures are breached or fail and result in unauthorized disclosure of data, we could lose clients, fail to attract new clients and be exposed to protracted and costly litigation. 
         Maintaining security of our SaaS technology is of critical importance for our clients because it stores and transmits proprietary and confidential university and student information, which may include sensitive personally identifiable information that is subject to stringent legal and regulatory obligations. As a technology company, we face an increasing number of threats to our SaaS technology, including unauthorized activity and access, system viruses, worms, malicious code and organized cyberattacks, any of which could breach our security and disrupt our solutions and our clients' programs. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, we could be subject to liability or our business could be interrupted, potentially over an extended period of time. Any or all of these issues could harm our reputation, adversely affect our ability to attract new clients and students, cause existing clients to scale back their programs or elect not to renew their agreements, cause prospective students not to enroll or students to stay enrolled in our clients' programs, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability. Further, any reputational damage resulting from breach of our security measures could create distrust of our company by prospective clients or students. In addition, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover losses associated with such events, and in any case, such insurance may not cover all of the types of costs, expenses and losses we could incur to respond to and remediate a security breach. As a result, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of these disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such disruptions or breaches. 
   We have grown rapidly and expect to continue to invest in our growth for the foreseeable future. If we fail to manage this growth effectively, the success of our business model will be compromised. 
         We have experienced rapid growth in a relatively short period of time, which has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure, facilities and other resources. Our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to continue to expand our program marketing and sales personnel, technology team, finance and administration teams, as well as our facilities and infrastructure. We will also be required to refine our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. If we fail to manage this expansion of our business efficiently, our costs and expenses may increase more than we plan and we may not successfully expand our client base, enhance our solutions, develop new programs with new and existing clients, attract a sufficient number of qualified students in a cost-effective manner, satisfy the requirements of our existing clients, respond to competitive challenges or otherwise execute our business plan. Although our business has experienced significant growth in the past, we cannot provide any assurance that our revenue will continue to grow at the same rate in the future. 
 25

          
        Our ability to manage any significant growth of our business effectively will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:
 

 effectively recruit, integrate, train and motivate a large number of new employees, including our program marketing and technology teams, while
retaining existing employees; 
 maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture and effectively execute our business plan; 
 continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls; 
 protect and further develop our strategic assets, including our intellectual property rights; and 
 make sound business decisions in light of the scrutiny associated with operating as a public company. 

         These activities will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources, and our growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. 
         There are no guarantees that we will be able to effectively manage any future growth in an efficient, cost-effective or timely manner, or at all. In particular, any failure to implement systems enhancements and improvements successfully will likely negatively impact our ability to manage our expected growth, ensure uninterrupted operation of key business systems and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to public reporting companies. Moreover, if we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our solutions could suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation, results of operations and overall business. 
   We may expand by acquiring or investing in other companies, which may divert our management's attention, result in dilution to our shareholders and consume resources that are necessary to sustain our business. 
         We may in the future acquire complementary products, services, technologies or businesses. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses to expand our ability to provide our solutions in the United States and in international markets. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to complete these transactions may often be subject to conditions or approvals that are beyond our control. Consequently, these transactions, even if undertaken and announced, may not close. 
         An acquisition, investment, or new business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, the acquired company's technology is not compatible with ours, or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business due to changes in management or otherwise. Additionally, we may encounter difficulties integrating the acquired companies with our standardized accounting systems as necessary to provide us with the accounting controls needed to comply with our continued financial reporting requirements as a public company. Acquisitions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources, and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the development of our business. Any problems or delays associated with the integration or the failure to complete the integrations on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to report financial information, including the filing of our quarterly or annual reports with the SEC on a timely and accurate basis. Moreover, the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment, or business relationship may not be realized or we may be exposed to unknown liabilities, including litigation against the companies we may acquire. For one or more of those transactions, we may:
 

 issue additional equity securities that would dilute our shareholders; 

 26

   

 use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business; 
 incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay or that may place burdensome restrictions on our operations; 
 incur large charges or substantial liabilities; or 
 become subject to adverse tax consequences. 

         Any of these outcomes could harm our business and operating results. 
   We face competition from established and emerging companies, which could divert clients to our competitors, result in pricing pressure and significantly reduce our revenue. 
         We expect existing competitors and new entrants to the online learning market to revise and improve their business models constantly in response to challenges from competing businesses, including ours. If these or other market participants introduce new or improved delivery of online education and technology-enabled services that we cannot match or exceed in a timely or cost-effective manner, our ability to grow our revenue and achieve profitability could be compromised. 
         Our primary competitors include EmbanetCompass and Deltak, which were acquired in 2012 by Pearson and John Wiley & Sons, respectively, both of which are large education and publishing companies. There are also several private companies, including HotChalk and Everspring, providing some or all of the services we provide, and these companies may choose to pursue some of the institutions we target. In addition, colleges and universities may choose to continue using or to develop their own online learning solutions in-house, rather than pay for our solutions. 
         Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater resources than we do. Increased competition may result in pricing pressure for us in terms of the percentage of tuition and fees we are able to negotiate to receive from a client. The competitive landscape may also result in longer and more complex sales cycles with a prospective client or a decrease in our market share among selective nonprofit colleges and universities seeking to offer online degree programs, any of which could negatively affect our revenue and future operating results and our ability to grow our business. 
         A number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential client opportunities or force us to offer our solutions on less favorable economic terms, including 
 

 competitors may develop service offerings that our potential clients find to be more compelling than ours; 
 competitors may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive sales terms, adapt more quickly to new technologies and
changes in client and student requirements, and devote greater resources to the acquisition of qualified students than we can; and 
 current and potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and
expand their markets, and our industry is likely to see an increasing number of new entrants and increased consolidation. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and
rapidly acquire significant market share. 

         We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. In addition, competition may intensify as our competitors raise additional capital and as established companies in other market segments or geographic markets expand into our market segments or geographic markets. If we cannot compete successfully against our competitors, our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability could be impaired. 
 27

     If for-profit postsecondary institutions, which offer online education alternatives different from ours, perform poorly, it could tarnish the reputation of online education as a whole, which could impair our ability to grow our business. 
         For-profit postsecondary institutions, many of which provide course offerings predominantly online, are under intense regulatory and other scrutiny, which has led to media attention that has sometimes portrayed that sector in an unflattering light. Some for-profit online school operators have been subject to governmental investigations alleging the misuse of public funds, financial irregularities, and failure to achieve positive outcomes for students, including the inability to obtain employment in their fields. These allegations have attracted significant adverse media coverage and have prompted legislative hearings and regulatory responses. These investigations have focused on specific companies and individuals, and even entire industries in the case of recruiting practices by for-profit higher education companies. Even though we do not market our solutions to these institutions, this negative media attention may nevertheless add to skepticism about online higher education generally, including our solutions. 
         The precise impact of these negative public perceptions on our current and future business is difficult to discern. If these few situations, or any additional misconduct, cause all online learning programs to be viewed by the public or policymakers unfavorably, we may find it difficult to enter into or renew contracts with selective colleges and universities or attract additional students for our clients' programs. In addition, this perception could serve as the impetus for more restrictive legislation, which could limit our future business opportunities. Moreover, allegations of abuse of federal financial aid funds and other statutory violations against for-profit higher education companies could negatively impact our opportunity to succeed due to increased regulation and decreased demand. Any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to increase our client base and grow our clients' programs, which would make it difficult to continue to grow our business. 
   If we do not retain our senior management team and key employees, we may not be able to sustain our growth or achieve our business objectives. 
         Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management team. Because of our small number of clients and the significant nature of each new client relationship, our senior management team is heavily involved in the client identification and sales process, and their expertise is critical in navigating the complex approval processes of large nonprofit colleges and universities. We do not maintain key-person insurance on any of our employees, including our senior management team. The loss of the services of any individual on our senior management team, or failure to find a suitable successor, could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. 
         Our future success also depends heavily on the retention of our program marketing and sales, technology and content development and support teams to continue to attract and retain qualified students in our clients' programs, thereby generating revenue for us. In particular, our highly-skilled technology and content development employees provide the technical expertise underlying our bundled technology-enabled services that support our clients' programs and the students enrolled in these programs. Competition for these employees is intense. As a result, we may be unable to attract or retain these key personnel that are critical to our success, resulting in harm to our relationships with clients, loss of expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. 
   If certain awards under our stock plans are deemed to have not expired in accordance with their terms, we could be liable to certain award holders for substantial amounts. 
         Each of our 2008 Stock Incentive Plan and 2014 Equity Incentive Plan provide that vested stock option awards issued under those plans expire upon the occurrence of certain events. For example, each plan provides, among other things, that stock options expire and are no longer exercisable upon 
 28

   the earlier to occur of 90 days after a separation of service, or, depending on the specific circumstances of the grantee, 5 or 10 years after the grant date. Award recipients under these plans have failed and may fail in the future to exercise their stock options within the prescribed time frame or may otherwise fail to comply with terms and conditions of the plans or the corresponding award agreements resulting in the expiration of those option awards. Award recipients with expired option awards have disagreed and may disagree in the future with our or our Compensation Committee's interpretation of the provisions in the plans or the award agreements. Any disagreement between us and holders of expired option awards regarding the expiration of those awards under the terms of the plan or award agreements could result in claims for breach of contract and other claims that could subject us to costly litigation that could require management time and involvement, regardless of whether such claims have merit. 
   We may need additional capital in the future to pursue our business objectives. Additional capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could compromise our ability to grow our business. 
         We believe that our existing cash balances and the available borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit, will be sufficient to meet our minimum anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months. We may, however, need to raise additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, accelerate our growth, develop new programs or enhance our solutions. If we seek to raise additional capital, it may not be available on favorable terms or may not be available at all. In addition, if we have borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, we may be restricted from using the net proceeds of financing transactions for our operating objectives. Lack of sufficient capital resources could significantly limit our ability to manage our business and to take advantage of business and strategic opportunities. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or debt securities with an equity component would dilute our stock ownership. If adequate additional funds are not available if and when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate material parts of our business strategy. 
   Our employees located outside of the United States and the international residents applying to and enrolling in our clients' programs expose us to international risks. 
         Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. We have a branch office in Hong Kong for program marketing and student support. Because we have employees in Hong Kong, we are subject to Hong Kong's compensation and benefits regulations, which differ from compensation and benefits regulations in the United States. Further, acquiring international applicants and enrollments for our clients requires us to comply with international data privacy regulations of the countries from which our clients' programs draw applicants and enrollments. Failure to comply with international regulations or to adequately adapt to international markets could harm our ability to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals. 
   Future programs or other offerings with colleges and universities outside the United States could expose us to risks inherent in international operations. 
         One element of our growth strategy is to expand our international operations and establish a worldwide client base. We cannot assure you that our expansion efforts into international markets will be successful. Our experience with attracting clients in the United States may not be relevant to our ability to attract clients in other emerging markets. In addition, we would face risks in doing business internationally that could constrain our operations and compromise our growth prospects, including:
 

 the need to localize and adapt online degree programs or other offerings for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages
and ensuring that these programs enable our clients to comply with local education laws and regulations; 

 29

   

 data privacy laws that may require data to be handled in a specific manner; 
 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including employment laws and regulations; different pricing environments, longer
sales cycles, longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues; 
 new and different sources of competition, and practices which may favor local competitors; 
 weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing
intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States; 
 compliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment,
tax, privacy and data protection, and anti-bribery laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; 
 increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; 
 restrictions on the transfer of funds; 
 adverse tax consequences, including the potential for required withholding taxes for our overseas employees; 
 unstable regional and economic political conditions; and 
 fluctuations in currency exchange rates or restrictions on foreign currency. 

   We might not be able to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability. 
         As of December 31, 2016, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2029. Our gross state net operating loss carryforwards are equal to or less than the federal net operating loss carryforwards and expire over various periods based on individual state tax laws. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an "ownership change," which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We have completed an analysis of the stock ownership changes through December 31, 2016, and determined that a greater than 50% ownership change of one or more of its 5-percent shareholders occurred. Absent a subsequent ownership change, all of our net operating losses subject to the ownership change should be available. Therefore, despite the fact that an ownership change occurred, such change is not expected to limit our ability to utilize carryforward net operating losses before expiration. In addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. If a future ownership change occurs and limits our ability to use our historical net operating loss carryforwards, it would harm our future financial statement results by increasing our future tax obligations. 
 30

          
  We engage some individuals classified as independent contractors, not employees, and if federal or state law mandates that they be classified as employees, our business would be adversely impacted. 
         We engage independent contractors and are subject to the Internal Revenue Service regulations and applicable state law guidelines regarding independent contractor classification. These regulations and guidelines are subject to judicial and agency interpretation, and it could be determined that the independent contractor classification is inapplicable. Further, if legal standards for classification of independent contractors change, it may be necessary to modify our compensation structure for these personnel, including by paying additional compensation or reimbursing expenses. In addition, if our independent contractors are determined to have been misclassified as independent contractors, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state law, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Any of these outcomes could result in substantial costs to us, could significantly impair our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business as we choose, and could damage our reputation and our ability to attract and retain other personnel. 
   Risks Related to Regulation of Our Business and That of Our Clients 
   Our business model relies on client institutions complying with federal and state laws and regulations. 
         Higher education is heavily regulated. All of our clients participate in Title IV federal student financial assistance programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, or HEA, and are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of Education, or DOE, as well as various state agencies, licensing boards and accrediting commissions. To participate in the Title IV programs, an institution must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the DOE, and be certified by the DOE as an eligible institution. If any of our clients were to be found to be in non-compliance with any of these laws, regulations, standards or policies, the client could lose some or all access to Title IV program funds, lose the ability to offer certain programs or lose their ability to operate in certain states, any of which could cause our revenue from that client's program to decline. 
         The regulations, standards and policies of our clients' regulators change frequently and are often subject to interpretation. Changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations or standards could compromise our clients' accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities or use of federal funds under Title IV programs. We cannot predict with certainty how the requirements applied by our clients' regulators will be interpreted, or whether our clients will be able to comply with these requirements in the future. 
   Our activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations and other requirements. 
         Although we are not an institution of higher education, we are required to comply with certain education laws and regulations as a result of our role as a service provider to higher education institutions, either directly or indirectly through our contractual arrangements with clients. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in breach of contract and indemnification claims and could cause damage to our reputation and impair our ability to grow our business and achieve profitability. 
   Activities of the U.S. Congress could result in adverse legislation or regulatory action. 
         The process of re-authorization of the HEA began in 2014 and is ongoing. Congressional hearings were held in 2013-2016 and will continue to be scheduled by the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and the Workforce and other Congressional committees regarding various aspects of the education industry, 
 31

   including accreditation matters, student debt, student recruiting, cost of tuition, distance learning, competency-based learning, student success and outcomes and other matters. 
         The increased scrutiny and results-based accountability initiatives in the education sector, as well as ongoing policy differences in Congress regarding spending levels, could lead to significant changes in connection with the reauthorization of the HEA or otherwise. These changes may place additional regulatory burdens on postsecondary schools generally, and specific initiatives may be targeted at or have an impact upon companies like us that serve higher education. The adoption of any laws or regulations that limit our ability to provide our bundled services to our clients could compromise our ability to drive revenue through their programs or make our solutions less attractive to them. Congress could also enact laws or regulations that require us to modify our practices in ways that could increase our costs. 
         In addition, regulatory activities and initiatives of the DOE may have similar consequences for our business even in the absence of Congressional action. 
   Our business model, which depends on our ability to receive a share of tuition revenue as payment from our clients, has been validated by a DOE "dear colleague" letter, but such validation is not codified by statute or regulation and may be subject to change. 
         Each institution that participates in Title IV programs agrees it will not "provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid, to any person or entity who is engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity, or in making decisions regarding the award of title IV, HEA program funds." All of our clients participate in Title IV Programs. 
         Although this rule, referred to as the incentive compensation rule, generally prohibits entities or individuals from receiving incentive-based compensation payments for the successful recruitment, admission or enrollment of students, the DOE provided guidance in 2011 permitting tuition revenue-sharing arrangements known as the "bundled services rule." Our current business model relies heavily on the bundled services rule to enter into tuition revenue-sharing agreements with client colleges and universities. 
         Because the bundled services rule was promulgated in the form of agency guidance issued by the DOE in the form of a "dear colleague" letter, or DCL, and is not codified by statute or regulation, there is risk that the rule could be altered or removed without prior notice, public comment period or other administrative procedural requirements that accompany formal agency rulemaking. Although the DCL represents the current policy of the DOE, the bundled services rule could be reviewed, altered or vacated in the future. In addition, the legal weight the DCL would carry in litigation over the propriety of any specific compensation arrangements under the HEA or the incentive compensation rule is uncertain. We can offer no assurances as to how the DCL would be interpreted by a court. The revision, removal or invalidation of the bundled services rule by Congress, the DOE or a court, whether in an action involving our company or our clients, or in action that does not involve us, could require us to change our business model and renegotiate the terms of our client contracts and could compromise our ability to generate revenue. 
   If we or our subcontractors or agents violate the incentive compensation rule, we could be liable to our clients for substantial fines, sanctions or other liabilities. 
         Even though the DCL clarifies that tuition revenue-sharing arrangements with our clients are permissible, we are still subject to other provisions of the incentive compensation rule that prohibit us from offering to our employees who are involved with or responsible for recruiting or admissions activities any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the successful identification, admission or enrollment of students into any institution. If we or our subcontractors or agents violate the 
 32

   incentive compensation rule, we could be liable to our clients for substantial fines, sanctions or other liabilities, including liabilities related to "whistleblower" claims under the federal False Claims Act. Any such claims, even if without merit, could require us to incur significant costs to defend the claim, distract management's attention and damage our reputation. 
   If we or our subcontractors or agents violate the misrepresentation rule, or similar federal and state regulatory requirements, we could face fines, sanctions and other liabilities. 
         We are required to comply with other regulations promulgated by the DOE that affect our student acquisition activities, including the misrepresentation rule. The misrepresentation rule is broad in scope and applies to statements our employees, subcontractors or agents may make about the nature of a client's program, a client's financial charges or the employability of a client's program graduates. A violation of this rule, FTC rules or other federal or state regulations applicable to our marketing activities by an employee, subcontractor or agent performing services for clients could hurt our reputation, result in the termination of client contracts, require us to pay fines or other monetary penalties or require us to pay the costs associated with indemnifying a client from private claims or government investigations. 
   If our clients fail to maintain their state authorizations, or we or our clients violate other state laws and regulations, students in their programs could be adversely affected and we could lose our ability to operate in that state and provide services to our clients. 
         Our clients must be authorized in certain states to offer online programs, engage in recruiting and operate externships, internships, clinical training or other forms of field experience, depending on state law. The loss of or failure to obtain state authorization would, among other things, limit a client's ability to enroll students in that state, render the client and its students ineligible to participate in Title IV programs in that state, diminish the attractiveness of the client's program and ultimately compromise our ability to generate revenue and become profitable. 
         In addition, if we or any of our clients fail to comply with any state agency's rules, regulations or standards beyond authorizations, the state agency or state attorney general could limit the ability of the client to offer programs in that state or limit our ability to perform our contractual obligations to our client in that state. 
   If our clients fail to maintain institutional or programmatic accreditation for their programs, our revenue could be materially affected. 
         The loss or suspension of a client's accreditation or other adverse action by the client's institutional or programmatic accreditor would render the institution or its program ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, could prevent the client from offering certain educational programs and could make it impossible for the graduates of the client's program to practice the profession for which they trained. If any of these results occurs, it could hurt our ability to generate revenue from that program. 
   Our future growth could be impaired if our clients fail to obtain timely approval from applicable regulatory agencies to offer new programs, make substantive changes to existing programs or expand their programs into or within certain states. 
         Our clients are required to obtain the appropriate approvals from the DOE and applicable state and accrediting regulatory agencies for new programs or locations, which may be conditioned, delayed or denied in a manner that could impair our strategic plans and future growth. Education regulatory agencies are generally experiencing significant increases in the volume of requests for approvals as a result of new distance learning programs and adjustments to the significant volume of new regulations 
 33

   over the last several years. Regulatory capacity constraints have resulted in delays to various approvals our client institutions are requesting, and such delays could in turn delay the timing of our ability to generate revenue from our clients' programs. 
   If more state agencies require specialized approval of our clients' programs, our operating costs could rise significantly, approval times could lag or we could be prohibited from operating in certain states. 
         In addition to state licensing agencies, our clients may be required to obtain approval from professional licensing boards in certain states to offer specialized programs in specific fields of study. Currently, relatively few states require institutions to obtain professional board approval for their professional programs when offered online. However, more states could pass laws requiring professional programs offered by our clients, such as graduate programs in teaching or nursing, to obtain approval from state professional boards. If a significant number of states pass additional laws requiring schools to obtain professional board approval, the cost of obtaining all necessary state approvals could dramatically increase, which could make our solutions less attractive to clients, and our clients could be barred from operating in some states entirely. 
   If the personally identifiable information we collect from students is unlawfully acquired, accessed or obtained, we could be required to pay substantial fines and bear the cost of investigating the data breach and providing notice to individuals whose personally identifiable information was unlawfully accessed. 
         In providing services to our clients, we collect personally identifiable information from students and prospective students, such as names, social security numbers and birth dates. In the event that the personally identifiable information is unlawfully accessed or acquired, the majority of states have laws that require institutions to investigate and immediately disclose the data breach to students, usually in writing. Under the terms of our contracts with our clients, we would be responsible for the costs of investigating and disclosing these data breaches to the clients' students. In addition to costs associated with investigating and fully disclosing a data breach in such instances, we could be subject to substantial monetary fines or private claims by affected parties and our reputation would likely be harmed. 
   We are required to comply with The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, and failure to do so could harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. 
         FERPA generally prohibits an institution of higher education from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student's education records without the student's consent. Our clients and their students disclose to us certain information that originates from or comprises a student education record under FERPA. As an entity that provides services to institutions, we are indirectly subject to FERPA, and we may not transfer or otherwise disclose any personally identifiable information from a student record to another party other than in a manner permitted under the statute. If we violate FERPA, it could result in a material breach of contract with one or more of our clients and could harm our reputation. Further, in the event that we disclose student information in violation of FERPA, the DOE could require a client to suspend our access to their student information for at least five years. 
   Risks Related to Intellectual Property 
   We operate in an industry with extensive intellectual property litigation. Claims of infringement against us may hurt our business. 
         Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to avoid infringing intellectual property rights owned by others and being able to resolve claims of intellectual property infringement without major financial expenditures or adverse consequences. The technology and software fields generally are characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and many companies that own, or claim to own, intellectual property have aggressively asserted their rights. From time to time, we may be subject to legal 
 34

   proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business. In addition, our client agreements require us to indemnify our clients against claims that our solutions infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. 
         Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves or our clients from intellectual property infringement claims or to establish our proprietary rights. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and would be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us. Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have any merit, these claims are time-consuming and costly to evaluate and defend and could:
 

 hurt our reputation; 
 adversely affect our relationships with our current or future clients; 
 cause delays or stoppages in providing our solutions; 
 divert management's attention and resources; 
 require technology changes to our software that could cause us to incur substantial cost; 
 subject us to significant liabilities; and 
 require us to cease some or all of our activities. 

         In addition to liability for monetary damages against us, which may include attorneys' fees, treble damages in the event of a finding of willful infringement, or, in some circumstances, damages against our clients, we may be prohibited from developing, commercializing or continuing to provide some or all of our bundled technology-enabled solutions unless we obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, the holders of the patents or other intellectual property rights, which may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all. 
   We may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication, distribution or other use of materials posted online. 
         In some instances, university personnel or students, or our employees or independent contractors, may post to Online Campus various articles or other third-party content for use in class discussions or within asynchronous lessons. The laws governing the fair use of these third-party materials are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, which makes it challenging to adopt and implement appropriately balanced institutional policies governing these practices. As a result, we could incur liability to third parties for the unauthorized duplication, distribution or other use of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our various liability insurance coverages may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter or cease our uses of such material, which may include changing or removing content from courses or altering the functionality of Online Campus, or to pay monetary damages. 
   Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our solutions, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue. 
         We regard the protection of our intellectual property, which includes trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and patent applications, as critical to our success. We protect our proprietary information from unauthorized use and disclosure by entering into confidentiality agreements with any party who may come in contact with such information. We also seek to ensure that we own intellectual property created for us by signing agreements with employees, independent 
 35

   contractors, consultants, companies and any other third party who may create intellectual property for us that assign their copyright and patent rights to us. However, these arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others. 
         We have also begun seeking patent protection for our processes, including two patent applications pending in the United States. These pending applications are directed to computer-implemented processes that facilitate asynchronous student responses to teacher questions. We cannot predict whether these pending patent applications will result in issued patents that will effectively protect our intellectual property. Even if a patent issues, the patent may be circumvented or its validity may be challenged in proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, we cannot assure you that every significant feature of our products and services will be protected by any patent or patent application. 
         We also pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in jurisdictions outside the United States. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe on our trademark or service mark rights, third parties may challenge our trademark or service mark rights, and pending or future trademark or service mark applications may not be approved. In addition, effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate. In any or all cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense to prevent infringement or enforce our rights. 
         Monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Further, we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Our competitors may also independently develop similar technology. In addition, the laws of many countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Further, the laws in the United States and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property rights. Our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering services that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our solutions. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate litigation such as infringement or administrative proceedings, to protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and thus we may not be able to stop our competitors from infringing upon our intellectual property rights. 
   Our use of "open source" software could negatively affect our ability to offer our solutions and subject us to possible litigation. 
         A substantial portion of our cloud-based SaaS technology incorporates so-called "open source" software, and we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. Open source software is generally freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source licenses may, in certain circumstances, require us to offer our solutions that incorporate the open source software for no cost, that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software we use were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, including being enjoined from the offering of our solutions that contained the open source software and being required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt our ability to offer the affected solutions. We could also 
 36

   be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition and require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products. 
   Individuals that appear in content hosted on Online Campus may claim violation of their rights. 
         Faculty and students that appear in video segments hosted on Online Campus may claim that proper assignments, licenses, consents and releases were not obtained for use of their likenesses, images or other contributed content. Our clients are contractually required to ensure that proper assignments, licenses, consents and releases are obtained for their course material, but we cannot know with certainty that they have obtained all necessary rights. Moreover, the laws governing rights of publicity and privacy, and the laws governing faculty ownership of course content, are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, such that the enforcement of agreements to transfer the necessary rights is unclear. As a result, we could incur liability to third parties for the unauthorized duplication, display, distribution or other use of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our various liability insurance coverages may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter or cease our use of such material, which may include changing or removing content from courses, or to pay monetary damages. Moreover, claims by faculty and students could damage our reputation, regardless of whether such claims have merit. 
   Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Our Status as a Public Company 
   Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline. 
         Our quarterly operating results have historically fluctuated due to seasonality and changes in our business, and our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. You should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:


 the timing of our costs incurred in connection with the launch of new programs and the delay in receiving revenue from these new programs,
which delay may last for several years; 
 seasonal variation driven by the semester schedules for our clients' programs, which may vary from year to year; 
 changes in the student enrollment and retention levels in our clients' programs from one term to the next; 
 changes in our key metrics or the methods used to calculate our key metrics; 
 changes in our clients' tuition rates; 
 the timing and amount of our program marketing and sales expenses; 
 costs necessary to improve and maintain our SaaS technology; and 
 changes in the prospects of the economy generally, which could alter current or prospective clients' or students' spending priorities, or could
increase the time it takes us to launch new client programs. 

         Our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors in some future periods, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially. 
 37



  The trading price of the shares of our common stock may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses. 
         Our stock price may be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:
 

 actual or anticipated variations in our operating results; 
 changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock; 
 conditions or trends in our industry, the stock market or the economy; 
 stock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the software and information
technology industries; 
 announcements by us or our competitors of new product or service offerings, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures; 
 announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us; 
 capital commitments; 
 investors' general perception of our company and our business; 
 recruitment or departure of key personnel; and 
 sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders. 

         In addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against technology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies' stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources from our business. 
   If equity research analysts do not continue to publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline. 
         The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. Equity research analysts may elect not to initiate or to continue to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Even if we do have equity research analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. 
   Provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result. 
         Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control is considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The board of 
 38

   directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders, which could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. 
         Our charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:
 

 only one of our three classes of directors will be elected each year; 
 stockholders are not entitled to remove directors other than by a 662/3% vote and only for cause; 
 stockholders are not permitted to take actions by written consent; 
 stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting of stockholders; and 
 stockholders are required to give us advance notice of their intention to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at
stockholder meetings. 

         In addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock. 
   Concentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and large stockholders may prevent smaller stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions. 
         Our executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own a substantial percentage of our outstanding common stock. These persons, acting together, are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. 
   If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired. 
         We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Form 10-K filing for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This may require us to incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to further expand our accounting and finance functions and expend significant management efforts. 
         We may in the future discover material weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. In addition, our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors 
 39

   and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to errors or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. 
         If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or other regulatory authorities. 
   Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gains and you may never receive a return on your investment. 
         You should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of our existing credit facility preclude, and the terms of any future debt agreements is likely to similarly preclude, us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. 
   We incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of being a public company. 
         As a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant additional legal, accounting and other costs. These additional costs could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Select Market, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. 
         Failure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management.
