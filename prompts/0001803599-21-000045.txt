ITEM 1. BUSINESS
We are a leading global provider of technology-infused Customer Experience (“CX”) solutions that help iconic and disruptive brands drive deep understanding, full lifecycle engagement, and differentiated experiences for their end-customers around the world. We provide end-to-end capabilities, including CX process optimization, technology innovation, front- and back-office automation, analytics and business transformation services to clients in five primary industry verticals. Our differentiated portfolio of solutions support Fortune Global 500 as well as high-growth companies across the globe in their efforts to deliver an optimized, consistent brand experience across all channels of communication, such as voice, chat, email, social media, asynchronous messaging, and custom applications. We strive to deliver exceptional services globally supported by our deep industry knowledge, technology and security practices, talented people, and digital and analytics expertise.
We offer our clients integrated solutions supporting the entirety of the customer lifecycle; CX and user experience (“UX”) strategy and design; analytics and actionable insights; and innovative new approaches to 
1


  
enhancing the customer experience through the latest technological advancements in our industry. We are a leader in the shift from traditional Customer Relationship Management (“CRM”), which is focused on a portion of the customer lifecycle, to CX, which supports the entirety of it. Through our end-to-end capabilities, we deliver better economic outcomes for our clients with solutions designed to meet their unique needs as they navigate a landscape characterized by discerning consumers and new market entrants. 
We have strong relationships with companies across the globe and are a provider of choice for industry leaders. We believe in supporting our clients over the long term to build enduring relationships. Our average client tenure is 15 years. As of November 30, 2020, we served over 95 Fortune Global 500 clients as well as more than 90 high-growth companies across various verticals and geographies that are attempting to disrupt their respective industries. We primarily support clients in verticals with certain characteristics, such as high growth, high transaction volume, high levels of compliance and security, and steep barriers to entry. Our strategic verticals include technology and consumer electronics, communications and media, retail, travel and ecommerce, banking, financial services and insurance, healthcare, and other. Our clients include:
•7 of the top 10 global digital companies
•8 of the top 10 global internet companies
•6 of the top 10 U.S. health insurance companies
•4 of the top 5 U.S. banks
•7 of the top 10 global automotive companies
Through our technology-infused offerings, our clients benefit from having a single resource that enables them to address the entirety of the customer journey from acquisition to support to renewal. Our end-to-end capabilities and broad service offerings help our clients acquire, retain, and improve the lifetime value of their customer relationships while optimizing their back-office processes.
We combine global consistency with local expertise, enhancing the end user experience for our clients’ customers through services rendered by approximately 270,000 employees across more than 280 locations in more than 40 countries and 6 continents, where we conduct business in over 70 languages. 
On December 1, 2020, the previously announced separation (the “separation”) of Concentrix and our technology-infused customer experience solutions business from SYNNEX Corporation (“SYNNEX”) was completed through a tax-free distribution of all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock to SYNNEX stockholders (the “distribution” and, together with the separation, the “spin-off”). SYNNEX stockholders received one share of our common stock for each share of SYNNEX common stock held as of the close of business on November 17, 2020. As a result of the spin-off, we became an independent public company and our common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “CNXC” on December 1, 2020. In connection with the spin-off, on November 30, 2020, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement, an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement and a commercial agreement with SYNNEX to set forth the principal actions to be taken in connection with the spin-off and define our ongoing relationship with SYNNEX after the spin-off. 
We trace our roots back to 2004 when SYNNEX acquired BSA Sales, Inc., a company with 20 employees focused on helping clients through outsourced sales and marketing services. In 2006, SYNNEX combined New York-based Concentrix with BSA Sales under the Concentrix name, with the goal of bringing technology and innovation into businesses to help clients reimagine and design the next generation of experiences. Concentrix Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in December 2009. 
 Our Market Opportunity
In order to maintain relevancy, our clients must transform their systems in response to increased competition and consumer demands. To meet the evolving needs of their customers, our clients are looking to large CX solutions providers, such as Concentrix, to automate their systems and provide professional support to address complexities beyond the scope of automation. We are a leader in next-generation CX technology driven by a focus on innovation, 
2


  
which we believe will increase our total addressable market as we enter and grow across new and existing markets. Our suite of integrated solutions include: digital services that enable efficient customer self-service; Voice of the Customer (“VOC”) solutions to gather and analyze customer feedback to foster loyalty to, and growth with, clients; analytics and consulting solutions that synthesize data and provide professional insight to improve clients’ customer experience strategies; Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) technology that can intelligently act on customer intent to improve customer experience with non-human engagement; Vertical business process outsourcing (“BPO”) services that provide specialized support to specific industry verticals; and Back Office BPO services that support clients in non-customer facing areas. 
Industry Trends
•Growing Importance of Customer Experience. We believe customer experience has become a strategic imperative for all enterprises today. Data, analytics, and digital solutions have reshaped the ways firms interact with their customers. As a result, enterprises are modernizing how they manage the customer experience across all channels of communication. The market is evolving from customer relationship management solutions that act as a cost cutting measure toward end-to-end CX management solutions that create value throughout the entire customer lifecycle at an appropriate cost. 
•Empowered Consumers and Users. The modern consumer is discerning and has come to expect a high level of care and responsiveness from their service providers. Old paradigms have shifted as increasingly competitive markets and easily accessible crowd-sourced information have empowered consumers to unprecedented levels. As consumers demand more and have an increasing number of alternatives, companies must differentiate on how they manage their customer relationships. This shift is driving the market toward consumer-centric solutions that reduce customer churn and promote brand loyalty.
•Technological Innovation. Emerging technology is driving change within our industry and shaping the demands of our clients. Advancements in areas such as Digital Services, AI and Machine Learning (“ML”) are further disrupting our markets and our clients’ markets while opening new avenues for growth and opportunities for us to better serve our clients. These technologies provide clients the opportunity to interact more effectively with their customers and improve the customer experience by automating processes, optimizing customer journeys to reach faster solutions, enabling personalized engagement across multiple platforms, and focusing human engagement on the most complex interactions. 
•Evolving Role of People. The skill set required of employees in the CRM and BPO industry is shifting as enterprises place increased importance on CX. Increasing complexity in the voice channel is driving a trend of longer customer engagements requiring CRM and BPO support professionals to have a more robust skill set. The increasing importance of skilled labor in our industry is offset by the transition of low complexity support to online support (self-service), driven by heavy automation and digitization. Despite growth in digital channels, phone conversations currently remain the preferred option for customer services interactions. We believe the human element will continue to be important in our industry, as focus shifts from routine service to “last-mile” support requiring human-touch to deliver a stronger customer experience. In our view, attracting and retaining skilled talent that can adapt to the evolving focus of customer engagements will require a diverse and inclusive workplace that supports employee wellness. 
•Mission Critical Nature of Cybersecurity. Technological innovation coupled with the proliferation of smart devices and mobile connectivity is generating sensitive data at scale. At the same time, the avenues for access have become numerous, and an increasing number of malicious actors are becoming more sophisticated and active. Data security is paramount in an environment where external intrusion, improper access, or carelessness can compromise customers and businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly expanded the prevalence of CX solutions that rely on work-at-home employees further underscoring the importance of robust data security. Businesses require scalable, industry-leading data protection and security to avoid reputational and operational risks in an environment characterized by the threats and benefits of free-flowing information.
•Enterprise Preferences Driving Vendor Consolidation. Enterprises have become increasingly multinational. As their scope of business increases, enterprises require a partner that can serve their needs 
3


  
by rapidly deploying solutions and new technology consistently across multiple geographies and channels. Enterprises therefore prefer vendors with scale and end-to-end capabilities that can be a one-stop shop and are consolidating existing relationships to vendors with scale to achieve their business objectives and pursue cost savings. 
•Market Fragmentation Driving Industry Consolidation. We operate in a fragmented marketplace characterized by numerous vendors offering services across various levels of the value chain. Currently the top 10 players in CX only hold an approximate 30% market share with the remaining market share held by thousands of other vendors. As client preferences continue to evolve in line with enterprise preferences, we anticipate that our market will undergo further consolidation. 
•Existing Solutions Have Many Limitations. As executives look to successfully navigate digital transformation and manage their customers’ experience across a wider variety of channels, unsophisticated providers and solutions often fail to meet customers’ needs. Currently there is a limited set of providers with end-to-end, global offerings of scale in the marketplace. The fragmentation of the market and, for many industries, high regulatory hurdles create additional complexity as most providers are small, niche, or local players. These issues are compounded by a lack of sufficient investment in cybersecurity, creating exposure to regulatory, reputational, and operational risks. These pain points, coupled with the prevalence of providers offering legacy solutions that fail to address the demands of the modern consumer, create an opportunity for large-scale, global CX solutions providers.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors and provide us with a competitive advantage:
•Market Leader with a Differentiated Brand and Value Proposition: We strive to have a compelling brand and reputation as a leading provider of technology-infused solutions that shape the customer experience. We have a differentiated combination of global scale, local reach, technological expertise, end-to-end solution capabilities and full lifecycle services. We are widely recognized as a leading provider of CX solutions; garnering industry attention via 82 industry awards in fiscal year 2020. Third-party researchers have also taken note of our leading global practice with Everest Group Research distinguishing us as a leader for the 5th time, recognizing us as a company with strong vision and strategy and high buyer satisfaction.
•Strong Relationships with a Growing and Diversified Client Base: We provide customer experience solutions for over 95 Fortune Global 500 brands worldwide. Leading companies worldwide, including more than 90 clients that believe they are disruptors in their industries and over 90 of the Fortune 500, rely upon our solutions and services. We serve a wide variety of clients, extending across numerous verticals. Our end-to-end capabilities and global scale has enabled us to build long-lasting relationships with our clients spanning over 15 years on average. Our commitment to our clients is our primary focus and has generated numerous accolades to date, including 47 client awards in fiscal year 2020.
•Extensive Global Presence: We operate globally in over 40 countries across 6 continents with the ability to conduct business in 70 different languages. We believe we are well-positioned to serve the largest multinational brands in nearly every market in which they operate. Our global footprint includes a strong presence in emerging markets such as India, China, Brazil, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, which provides an opportunity to grow with our clients in these regions. Our ability to create value for our clients across a global delivery platform has enabled us to be a partner of choice. 
•Continued Investment in Research and Development: We believe that our investment in technology differentiates us from our competitors. We have provided technology-infused solutions for longer than a decade. We have been at the forefront of developing technology-infused CX solutions that improve the customer experience and will continue to strive for this in the future. We have been a leader in our industry in advancements such as conversational virtual assistants, multichannel and augmented CRM, predictive analytics, emotion analytics, cognitive learning and AI and enjoy a first mover advantage. We are also an industry leader in cybersecurity best practices. We believe our strong focus on innovation has enabled us to maximize value for our clients and made it harder for our competitors to compete with us. Due to our size and scale, and the regular implementation of technology as part of our CX solutions, our costs of developing, maintaining and integrating new technologies are not material on a stand-alone basis.

•Track Record of Sustainable Organic Growth: We have an established track record of long-term organic revenue growth, and we believe we will continue to enjoy sustainable growth while rebalancing our portfolio from acquisitions as a result of:
•Nature of our offerings
•Substantial switching costs for our clients
•High net revenue retention rates 
•Strong barriers to entry in the CX solutions market
•Large and expanding addressable market
•Demonstrated History of Strategic Acquisitions: We have acquired and integrated more than 15 companies since our inception. We have a demonstrated ability to turn around underutilized assets and maximize their value, which we believe allows us to explore a broader scope of opportunities than our peers. In 2018, we acquired Convergys, which enhanced our ability to deliver additional transformative services to our clients with a broader global footprint.
•Corporate Culture Committed to Our Clients’ Success: Our unified team allows us to deliver consistent and exceptional results. As of November 30, 2020, our team consisted of approximately 270,000 employees globally. We enjoy high staff engagement because of a strong company culture that is fanatical about serving our clients through integrity and bold and disruptive thought. We strive for diversity and inclusion in the workplace and emphasize employee wellness and mental health. We believe this supportive environment reinforces the commitment of our team, empowers our employees to make an impact on our global community, and drives better customer experiences and improved outcomes for our clients. 
•Experienced Management Team: Our passionate and committed management team is led by industry experts with a deep understanding of our clients’ needs. We have a highly talented management team with significant experience in the CX industry, with our senior leadership team having an average of nearly 30 years of experience. Through our acquisitions we have benefited from the addition of management talent, who have contributed valuable new perspectives and insights. Under our tenured management team, we have grown our revenue from $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2014 to $4.7 billion in fiscal year 2020, while delivering strong profitability.
Our Growth Strategy 
The key elements to our growth strategy are: 
•Expand and Deepen Relationships with Existing Clients: We have a well-established track record of cross-selling and offering additional solutions and premium services to sustain and grow our relationships with our existing clients. We have historically focused on clients with high transaction volume on a recurring basis, fast growing verticals, and large enterprises, and will continue to do so. We believe our scale, efficiency, and technology generates incremental value for our clients with each process we manage, naturally driving our customers to spend more with us. We believe our focus on technology innovation and responding to our clients’ needs positions us for continued growth. 
•Relentlessly Innovate and Develop New Digital Services and Solutions: We believe we have developed innovative solutions for our clients, and we are focused on investing in technology. Investment in CX solutions technologies can enable more effective engagement with customers and improve the customer experience through increased automation, optimize customer journeys to reach faster solutions, enable personalized engagement across multiple platforms, and focus human engagement on the most complex interactions. For these reasons, we believe investments in disruptive technologies, applications, and services will continue to be instrumental in driving better value for our clients and result in increased profitability.
•Further Expand into Adjacent Markets: Our marketplace continues to expand beyond CRM BPO. We see significant opportunity for growth across adjacent markets. We intend to continue to provide our clients with an integrated offering of solutions that include digital services, VOC solutions, analytics and 
6


  
consulting, AI technology, Vertical BPO services and Back Office BPO services. To further capitalize on new market adjacencies, we have made significant investments across emerging technologies such as RPA, AI, ML, VOC, IVR, and Internet of Things (“IoT”), which we believe will enhance our clients’ ability to offer personalized, effective engagement in all customer interactions to increase customer satisfaction and promote brand loyalty. As our industry evolves, we will continue to invest in these new and fast growing markets to further sustain long-term growth.
•Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions: We have made targeted acquisitions to increase our technology expertise, enter new verticals and geographies, and increase our scale, including the IBM Customer Care Business and Convergys. Our market remains highly fragmented and we believe that our acquisition strategy enhances and augments our growth avenues. We intend to continue to evaluate and pursue complementary, value enhancing acquisitions. 
•Invest in Emerging Markets: We have invested in delivery operations in emerging, high-growth markets such as India, China, Brazil, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. We expect to continue to invest in similar markets to be well-positioned to serve multinational brands and enable us to grow with our clients in the regions and countries where they are growing.
Our Customers
In fiscal year 2020, we served approximately 750 clients across various verticals and geographies. Our strategic verticals include: technology and consumer electronics, communications and media, retail, travel and ecommerce, banking, financial services and insurance, healthcare and other. We focus on developing long-term, strategic relationships with clients in verticals with certain characteristics, such as high growth, high transaction volume, high levels of compliance and security, and steep barriers to entry.
Sales and Marketing
We market our services through a sales force organized by industry vertical and geography. The length of our selling cycle varies depending on the type of engagement. Our efforts may begin in response to our lead generation program, a perceived opportunity, a reference by an existing client, a request for proposal or otherwise. The sales cycle varies depending on the type of services work as well as whether there is an existing relationship with the client.
We have designated client partners or global relationship managers for each of our strategic relationships. The relationship manager is supported by process improvement, quality, transition, finance, human resources, information technology and industry or subject matter expert teams to ensure the best possible solution is provided to our clients.
We also strive to foster relationships between our senior leadership team and our clients’ senior management. These “C-level” relationships ensure that both parties are focused on establishing priorities, aligning objectives and driving client value from the top down. High-level executive relationships have been particularly constructive as a means of increasing business from our existing clients. It also provides us with a forum for addressing client concerns. We constantly measure our client satisfaction levels to ensure that we maintain high service levels for each client.
Our Operations
We have global delivery capabilities that allow us to scale our operations with people and other resources from around the world, including language fluency, proximity to clients and time-zone advantages. A critical component of this capability is our more than 280 locations in more than 40 countries throughout the Americas, Asia-Pacific and EMEA. Our delivery centers improve the efficiency of our engagement teams through the reuse of processes, solution designs and infrastructure by leveraging the experience of delivery center professionals. Services are provided from these global locations to customers worldwide in multiple languages. These services are supported by proprietary and third-party technologies to enable efficient and secure customer contact through various channels 
7


  
including voice, chat, web, email, social media and other digital platforms. All of our delivery centers and data centers are subject to annual certifications and attestations that include Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) version 3.2.1, ISO 27001:2013 and SOC2 Type II. Twenty-eight of our delivery centers around the world are certified to the COPC (Customer Operation Performance Center) Outsource Service Provider standard. For our healthcare clients, we have achieved HITRUST Common Security Framework (CSF) 9.3 certification. We also maintain a Level 3 CMMI version 1.3 certification for services and development for our major technology development centers globally. 
We also have the capability to provide services for our clients with work-at-home employees. During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly expanded the prevalence of CX solutions that rely on remote employees, and we increased our productive work-at-home employees to more than 60% of our total workforce. Our SecureCXTM platform supports secure remote work environments through digital tools and technology that authenticate and monitor the remote employee, restrict unauthorized personnel and devices, and deliver real-time alerting of attempts to circumvent control.
We operate a globally distributed data processing environment that can integrate service delivery center data servers and databases with our data centers and points of presence. Our technologically-advanced and secured data centers provide availability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with redundant power and communication feeds and emergency power back-up, and are designed to withstand most natural disasters.
The capacity of our data center and contact center operations, our nimble approach to work-at-home employees, and the scalability of our customer management solutions enable us to meet the changing needs of large-scale and rapidly growing companies and government entities. By leveraging our scale and efficiencies across our common system platforms, we can provide rapid client-specific enhancements and modifications without incurring many of the costs of a full custom application, which positions us as a value-added provider of customer support products and services.
International Operations
Approximately 78% of our revenue is generated by our non-U.S. operations. A key element in our business strategy has been to locate our service delivery contact centers in markets that are strategic to our customer requirements and cost beneficial. We have significant operations in the Philippines and India.
Sales and cost concentrations in international jurisdictions subject us to various risks, including the impact of changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar, which in turn can impact reported revenues and cost of revenues.
See Note 10 to the combined financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional financial information related to our international and domestic operations.
Seasonality
Our revenue and margins fluctuate with the underlying trends in our clients’ businesses. As a result, our revenues and margins are typically the highest in our fourth fiscal quarter.
Information Technology
We invest in IT systems, infrastructure, automation and security to enhance workforce management and improve productivity. Our contact centers can employ a broad range of technology, including digital switching, intelligent call routing and tracking, proprietary workforce management systems, case management tools, proprietary software systems, computer telephony integration, interactive voice response, advanced speech recognition, web-based tools and relational database management systems with embedded security. Our innovative use of technology enables us to improve our voice, chat, web and e-mail handling and personnel scheduling, thereby increasing our efficiency and enhancing the quality of the services we deliver to our clients and their customers. We 
8


  
are able to respond to changes in client call volumes and manage call volume traffic based on agent availability. Additionally, we can use this technology to collect information concerning the contacts, including number, response time, duration and results of the contact and report the information to the client on a periodic basis for purposes of monitoring quality of service and accuracy of billing.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving global marketplace. Our major competitors include Accenture plc, Atento S.A., Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Conduent Inc., ExlService Holdings, Inc., Genpact Limited, Globant S.A., Medallia, Inc., Qualtrics, LLC, Sitel Group, Sykes Enterprises Inc., TaskUs Inc., Teleperformance S.A., TELUS International, TTEC Holdings, Inc., Transcosmos Inc., Webhelp SAS, and WNS (Holdings) Limited.
In the future, we may face greater competition due to the consolidation of CX solutions providers. Consolidation activity may result in competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or more attractive pricing than ours. In addition, a client or potential client may choose not to outsource its business, by setting up captive outsourcing operations or performing formerly outsourced services for themselves, or may switch CX solutions providers.
Human Capital Resources
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and retains exceptional talent. Through ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety and employee wellbeing, we strive to help our employees in all aspects of their lives so they can do their best work. 
As of November 30, 2020, we had approximately 270,000 full-time employees, of which approximately 57,000 were based in the Americas, approximately 185,000 were based in Asia-Pacific, and approximately 26,000 were based in EMEA. Except for a small number of our employees in certain countries, generally required by local regulations or brought in through acquisitions, our employees are not represented by a labor union, nor are they covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We believe that a diverse employee population, including across background, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and lived experiences, is critical to our success and contributes to a work environment that promotes bold and contrarian thinking and an entrepreneurial mindset. We strive to create an inclusive workplace where people can bring their authentic selves to work. Our employees are encouraged to leverage their personal strengths and experiences to continually innovate and contribute to the development of new ideas and process improvements that drive better customer experiences and improved outcomes for our clients. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts with our highly skilled and diverse board of directors, a majority of which is women. In 2020, Concentrix strengthened its commitment to diversity by creating the role of Senior Director of Community and Culture to lead efforts for staff experience, diversity, equity and inclusion, wellbeing, and global citizenship. In 2020, our Chief Executive Officer, Chris Caldwell, was named one of the ten best CEOs for Women and one of the ten best CEOs for Diversity by Comparably, a workplace culture and compensation website.
Pay Equity or Total Rewards
We believe people should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of their job, and their performance. We also review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable. We have reviewed the compensation of employees to ensure consistent pay practices by conducting a gender pay equity analysis comparing employees in the same role within a country or location.
9


  
We require a uniquely talented workforce and are committed to providing total rewards that are market-competitive and performance based, driving innovation and operational excellence. Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with and drives long-term stockholder value. Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent.
Employee Engagement
We pride ourselves on being fanatical about our staff. Our company culture emphasizes the satisfaction and well-being of our employees and a diverse, engaged workforce. We regularly solicit the opinion and views of our employees through an employee satisfaction survey, the results of which inform key staff initiatives to support engagement and foster retention. The global participation rate for our most recent employee satisfaction survey in 2020 was more than 85%, and our average employee satisfaction score exceeded 4.3 out of 5, an increase of approximately 1.4% from 2019. 
Training and Development
Human capital development underpins our efforts to execute our strategy and continue to deliver exceptional services globally. We invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development. Front-line staff receive continual feedback and reinforcement from supervisors who provide coaching, often in real time, so that staff can more readily apply their training to assist our clients and their customers. In addition, our employees have access to more than 10,800 online courses and 350 learning paths through Concentrix University to develop skills specific to their current roles and promote ongoing career growth.
Health, Safety and Wellness
The physical health, financial stability, life balance and mental health of our employees is vital to our success. We sponsor a wellness program designed to enhance physical, financial, and mental well-being for all of our employees. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress tracking, wellness challenges, and other incentives. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on mental health. We also successfully transitioned a significant portion of our workforce to a remote working environment and implemented a number of safety and social distancing measures in our sites to protect the health and safety of our employees. We are focused on supporting access to COVID-19 vaccines for our employees around the world. In January 2021, we announced initiatives in the Philippines and India to ensure our employees in those countries are able to receive a vaccination at no charge, and we expect to implement similar initiatives in countries where our employees do not have access to free vaccines.
