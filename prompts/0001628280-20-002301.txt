BUSINESS
Overview
Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage oncology company developing product candidates to address the genetic and immunological promoters of cancer. In immuno-oncology, we are advancing our kinase inhibitor clinical program where our product candidate has the potential to improve the immune environment of tumor cells and enhance and expand the efficacy of existing cancer immunotherapy medicines when given in combination. Our KRAS inhibitor program is focused on developing novel inhibitors of KRAS mutations and includes one clinical program and a preclinical program. We also have additional preclinical programs which include potentially first-in-class and best-in-class product candidates specifically designed to address mutations and tumors where few treatment options exist. We approach each of our discovery and development programs with a singular focus: to translate our deep understanding of the molecular drivers of cancer into better therapies and better outcomes for patients.
Our clinical programs consist of two product candidates: MRTX849, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, and sitravatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor. We have several early discovery programs, including a preclinical program for a KRAS G12D inhibitor.
KRAS Inhibitor Program
The RAS family of genes is the most commonly mutated oncogene and mutations in this gene family occur in up to approximately 25% of all human cancers. Among the RAS family members, mutations most frequently occur in KRAS (approximately 85% of all RAS family mutations). Tumors characterized by KRAS mutations are commonly associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that cancer cells exhibiting KRAS mutations are highly dependent on KRAS function for cell growth and survival. Historically, KRAS has been extremely difficult to directly inhibit due to the absence of a tractable small molecule drug binding site. Our KRAS inhibitor program is focused on the discovery and development of small molecule compounds that target KRAS G12C and G12D. We intend to pursue development of our KRAS G12C inhibitor program in both single agent and rational combination approaches. We also have a KRAS G12D inhibitor program in preclinical development.

MRTX849

Background
MRTX849, our lead KRAS G12C compound, is an investigational, specific, potent and orally available small molecule. MRTX849 is designed to directly inhibit KRAS G12C mutations. KRAS G12C mutations are present in approximately 14% of non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) adenocarcinoma patients, 4% of colorectal cancer (“CRC”) patients, 2% of pancreatic cancer patients, as well as smaller percentages of several other difficult-to-treat cancers. Based on observed preclinical attributes, we believe MRTX849 has the potential to be a best-in-class product candidate for the suppression of G12C mutant KRAS signaling. Single agent treatment with MRTX849 has shown complete regression in a subset of KRAS G12C-positive human tumor models implanted in mice.
Program Update
We received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) authorization of our investigational new drug application for MRTX849 in November 2018, and on January 15, 2019, we announced that we had dosed the first patient in the dose escalation phase of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors that harbor G12C mutations. This trial is designed to enable rapid expansion of the single agent cohorts and could potentially serve as the basis of a new drug application (“NDA”) submission seeking accelerated approval by the FDA. This trial also enables exploratory combination cohorts. Following single agent dose escalation, we are expanding into cohorts that include patients with NSCLC, CRC and those with other tumors that carry the G12C mutation.

On October 28, 2019, we reported the first interim clinical data from this Phase 1/2 clinical trial in a presentation at the 2019 American Association for Cancer Research-National Cancer Institute-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (“AACR-NCI-EORTC”) International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in Boston, Massachusetts. As of October 11, 2019, the trial had enrolled 17 patients, including 10 patients with NSCLC, four patients with CRC, and three patients with other tumor types. Five dose cohorts have been evaluated: 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, and 1200 mg, taken orally once daily (“QD”), and 600 mg, taken orally twice daily (“BID”). The trial enrolled single patient dose escalation cohorts in an accelerated titration design. Trial objectives include evaluation of safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics (“PK”) and tumor response evaluated using RECIST v1.1 criteria.
As of the data cut-off date of October 11, 2019, 12 patients across all dose levels were evaluable for response with at least one radiographic scan. 

• | At the highest dose (600 mg BID), three of five evaluable patients with NSCLC and one of two evaluable patients with CRC achieved a Partial Response ("PR"), and the remaining patients experienced stable disease.


• | Across all dose levels, three of six patients with NSCLC and one of four patients with CRC achieved a PR. Two responding patients (one with NSCLC and one with CRC) achieved confirmed PRs, both with continuing tumor shrinkage following their first scan. The other two patients with PRs (both NSCLC) remain on study but have not yet had confirmatory scans.


• | Clinical PK data demonstrated that the dose of 600 mg BID results in drug levels that meet or exceed those likely to lead to full inhibition of KRAS G12C signaling.


• | Treatment duration across all dose levels ranged from 6.7- 38.6 weeks for patients with NSCLC and 9.9-30.1 weeks for patients with CRC as of the data cut-off.

Treatment-related adverse events were primarily grade 1 events. One patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity ("DLT") at the 1200 mg QD dose (capsule burden intolerance 12 capsules) and one patient experienced a DLT at the 600 mg BID dose (grade 3/4 isolated amylase/lipase increase). The maximum tolerated dose was not established and further dose escalation may be explored. Enrollment into dose expansion at the 600 mg BID dose is underway.
MRTX849 Development in Collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("Novartis")
In July 2019, we announced a clinical collaboration agreement with Novartis to evaluate the combination of MRTX849 and Novartis’ investigational SHP2 inhibitor, TNO155, in patients with advanced solid tumors that harbor G12C mutations. Under the terms of the non-exclusive collaboration, we will sponsor the trial and Novartis and Mirati will jointly oversee and share the costs of clinical development activities for the combined therapy. Novartis will provide TNO155 at no cost.
Sitravatinib
Sitravatinib is a spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor designed to potently inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases (“RTK”s), including TAM family receptors (TYRO3, Axl, Mer), split family receptors (VEGFR2, KIT) and RET. Sitravatinib is an investigational agent that is being evaluated in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Sitravatinib in Combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
Background
Sitravatinib’s potent inhibition of TAM and split family RTKs may overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy through targeted reversal of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, enhancing antigen-specific T cell response and expanding dendritic cell-dependent antigen presentation. As an immuno-oncology agent, sitravatinib is being evaluated in combination with nivolumab (OPDIVO®), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (“BMS”) anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, in patients with NSCLC who have experienced documented disease progression following treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. Sitravatinib is also being developed in certain Asian territories in collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd. (“BeiGene”) who is evaluating sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab, BeiGene’s investigational anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in a number of advanced solid tumors.
Program Update
In an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial, we are evaluating sitravatinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with NSCLC who have experienced documented disease progression following prior treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor. On October 22, 2018, we reported data from this clinical trial at the 2018 European Society of Medical Oncology Congress (“ESMO”), based on a data cutoff date of August 27, 2018. A summary of these data, with response confirmations updated after the data cutoff date, is presented below:

• | 56 patients were evaluable for response with at least one radiographic scan. Patients had a median of two lines of previous therapy;


• | 45 of 56 evaluable patients demonstrated tumor reductions; 18 of whom demonstrated tumor reductions greater than 30%;


• | 11 of 56 evaluable patients achieved a confirmed PR or Complete Response ("CR");


• | 26 of 56 evaluable patients remained on treatment at the time of data cut-off including eight responding patients;


• | a preliminary Kaplan-Meier estimate of median duration of response was greater than nine months, with six responding patients treated for more than six months and two responding patients treated for more than 12 months; and


• | the combination has shown an acceptable toxicity profile, and most adverse events reported by investigators were Grade 1 or 2.

We held an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the third quarter of 2018 with respect to the development of sitravatinib in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in NSCLC. Based on feedback received from the FDA, we initiated in July 2019 a Phase 3 randomized clinical trial in second-line NSCLC patients. The Phase 3 clinical trial is comparing the combination of sitravatinib plus nivolumab to docetaxel in patients whose tumors have progressed on prior therapy with platinum-chemotherapy in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. Ultimately, we expect the results of this clinical trial, if positive, to enable a NDA submission for the treatment of NSCLC patients whose tumors have progressed following treatment with a platinum-containing regimen in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. Enrollment is ongoing in the Phase 3 clinical trial. 
In January 2020, we amended the protocol to include third line patients who have received chemotherapy followed by a checkpoint inhibitor, in addition to second line patients treated with a combination of chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor. Based on a data cut of August 27, 2018, from the ongoing Phase 2 study in a similar patient population, the Kaplan-Meier median overall survival was greater than 15 months. We also amended the statistical design to include an interim analysis of overall survival that we believe, if positive, could support an NDA submission seeking full approval. By amending the protocol, the overall sample size decreased from approximately 660 to 530 patients. 
On January 7, 2019, we announced a clinical collaboration with BMS in connection with the aforementioned Phase 3 clinical trial. Under the terms of the collaboration, we will sponsor and fund the clinical trial and BMS will provide nivolumab at no cost. In certain specified cases, BMS will have an exclusive right to negotiate a commercial agreement with us for a limited period of time with respect to developing and commercializing sitravatinib worldwide excluding certain territories in Asia, Australia and New Zealand. We maintain global development and commercial rights to sitravatinib outside of certain Asian territories, where we have partnered with BeiGene, and we are free to develop the program in combination with other agents.
During the third quarter of 2018, we initiated an open label, multi-cohort Phase 2 clinical trial of sitravatinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. On November 9, 2019, we reported data from this clinical trial at the 2019 Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 34th Annual Meeting, based on a data cutoff of October 17, 2019. Data from Cohort 1 of the trial were presented, where patients must have been previously treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and prior platinum-based chemotherapy and had documented disease progression. A summary of these data is presented below:

• | as of the data cut-off date of October 17, 2019, 22 patients were evaluable for response with at least one radiographic scan;


• | 6 of 22 evaluable patients achieved a confirmed CR (1 patient) or PR (5 patients);


• | 21 of 22 evaluable patients achieved a confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease;


• | 4 responding patients had been treated for more than 6 months; and


• | the combination was well-tolerated and most adverse events were Grade 1 or 2.

During the third quarter of 2018, we also initiated an open label Phase 2 clinical trial to assess the mechanism of action of sitravatinib combined with nivolumab in patients with advanced clear cell renal cell cancer (“RCC”). 
We recently determined to cease enrollment in the Phase 1b expansion clinical trial evaluating sitravatinib as a single agent in patients with NSCLC and other tumor types who have genetic alterations in Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma.
Sitravatinib Development in Collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd.
In January 2018, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “BeiGene Agreement”) with BeiGene, pursuant to which we and BeiGene agreed to collaboratively develop sitravatinib in Asia (excluding Japan and certain other countries), Australia and New Zealand (the “Licensed Territory”). Under the BeiGene Agreement, we granted BeiGene an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sitravatinib in the Licensed Territory, and we retained exclusive rights for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of sitravatinib outside the Licensed Territory.
In November 2018, we announced the dosing of the first patient under the BeiGene Agreement in a Phase 1b clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of sitravatinib in combination with BeiGene’s investigational anti-PD-1 antibody, tislelizumab, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The clinical trial is currently enrolling patients in China and Australia. BeiGene’s clinical trials will evaluate the combination of sitravatinib and tislelizumab in patients with NSCLC, RCC, hepatocellular cancer, gastric cancer and ovarian cancer. In December 2019, BeiGene reported initial proof of concept data for the ovarian cancer arm of the trial at the 2019 ESMO Immuno-Oncology Congress.
Market and Competition
Market

The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2019, approximately 228,000 patients in the United States ("U.S.") were diagnosed with lung cancer and 143,000 died due to the disease. Lung cancer represents almost 13% of all new cancer cases in the U.S., and 25% of all cancer deaths. Approximately 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer patients is 19%, indicating a significant need for novel therapies to extend overall survival in this patient population.

The prognosis for advanced NSCLC is poor, and the primary objective of treating late-stage disease is to prolong overall survival, delay disease progression and control symptoms. The treatment algorithm for advanced NSCLC has changed significantly following recent approvals and label expansions of immuno-oncology agents, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors. In 2015, the FDA approved OPDIVO®, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, and the first immuno-oncology agent approved for the treatment of squamous NSCLC. The approval of OPDIVO® in NSCLC was subsequently followed by FDA approval of three additional immuno-oncology agents in NSCLC, KEYTRUDA®, TECENTRIQ®, and IMFINZI®. These four agents, approved for multiple indications including NSCLC, accounted for over $16 billion in global sales in 2018.

Despite the advances in patient outcomes demonstrated by approved immuno-oncology therapies in NSCLC, a significant patient need remains. The percentage of patients who respond to approved immuno-oncology treatments is quite low, and of the patients that respond, the majority will still experience disease progression. We believe that combinations of checkpoint inhibitors with other agents like sitravatinib have the potential to improve efficacy outcomes and overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy through complementary mechanisms. 

NSCLC represents a heterogeneous patient population with diverse tumor histology and underlying genomic aberrations. The clinical and commercial success of leading targeted agents across multiple indications, including NSCLC, demonstrates the potential of new targeted treatments for cancer. 
Competition
KRAS G12C

We are aware of three companies with competing clinical-stage direct KRAS G12C inhibitor programs: Amgen, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, and Johnson & Johnson. In addition to these direct inhibitor competitor programs, other companies with clinical programs that target mutant KRAS include Merck & Co. / Moderna and Boehringer Ingelheim. 
Sitravatinib in Combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors

There are several immune checkpoint inhibitors currently approved for use as single agents to treat multiple tumor types, including NSCLC. To augment the efficacy of these agents, combination studies are being conducted with a variety of potentially synergistic mechanisms, including inhibitors of CTLA-4, LAG3, and CSF-1R. Most of these combination studies are being conducted in patients who are naïve to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. A competitor whose agent is being evaluated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients that are naïve to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is Nektar Therapeutics (CD-122 agonist). Competitors whose agents are being evaluated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients who failed previous immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy include Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Adenosine A2Ar 
inhibitor), BMS (GITR inhibitor and LAG3 inhibitor) and Syndax, Inc. (HDAC inhibitor). Direct mechanistic competitors to sitravatinib in immunotherapy include CABOMETYX® (Exelixis, Inc.) and LENVIMA® (Eisai Co., Ltd.), both anti-VEGF agents that also inhibit other receptor tyrosine kinases. 
Oncology

In addition to companies that have kinase inhibitors addressing our targets of interest, our competition also includes hundreds of private and publicly traded companies that operate in the area of oncology but have therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. The oncology market in general is highly competitive, with over 1,000 molecules currently in clinical development. Other important competitors, in addition to those mentioned above, are small and large biotechnology companies, specialty and regional pharmaceutical companies and multinational pharmaceutical companies, including but not limited to Astellas Pharma Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bayer-Schering Pharmaceutical, Boehringer Ingelheim AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eisai Co. Ltd., Eli Lilly and Company, F. Hoffmann- LaRoche Ltd., Gilead Sciences, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer, Inc., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
Intellectual Property

Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection wherever appropriate for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies both in the United States and in other countries. We typically file for patents in the United States with counterparts in certain countries in Europe and certain key market countries in the rest of the world, thereby covering the major pharmaceutical markets. As of December 31, 2019, we own or co-own U.S. patents and patent applications and their foreign counterparts, including 28 issued U.S. patents, including one for KRAS inhibitors and 11 for sitravatinib and other kinase inhibitors, with expiration dates ranging from 2026 - 2040. In some instances, patent terms can be increased or decreased, depending on the laws and regulations of the country or jurisdiction that issued the patent. 
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our product candidates, nor do we plan to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials and finished products for our preclinical and clinical trials.
Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented.
Government Regulation
The Regulatory Process for Drug Development
The production and manufacture of our product candidates and our research and development activities are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities around the world. In the United States, drug products are subject to regulation by the FDA. There are other comparable agencies in Europe and other parts of the world. Regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products. Applicable legislation requires licensing of manufacturing and contract research facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, and governmental review and/or approval of results prior to marketing therapeutic products. Additionally, adherence to good laboratory practices (“GLP”) and good clinical practices (“GCP”) during nonclinical and clinical testing and cGMP during production is required.
U.S. Pharmaceutical Product Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP standards and regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

The FDA monitors the progress of trials conducted in the U.S. under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s risk/benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The FDA may also place a hold on one or more clinical trials conducted under an IND for a drug if it deems warranted. Furthermore, even after regulatory approval of an NDA is obtained, under certain circumstances, such as later discovery of previously unknown problems, the FDA can withdraw approval or subject the drug to additional restrictions.
Preclinical Studies:   Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to evaluate efficacy and activity, toxic effects, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the pharmaceutical product candidate and to provide evidence of the safety, bioavailability and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate in animals. Most of these studies must be performed according to GLP.
Clinical Trials:    Clinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA's GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), or ethics committee at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Clinical trials in the U.S. typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2, 3 and post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds.
Phase 1 Clinical Trials:    Phase 1 clinical trials are generally conducted on a small number of healthy human subjects to evaluate the drug's activity, schedule and dose, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects. However, in the case of life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, the initial Phase 1 testing may be done in patients with the disease. These trials typically take longer to complete and may provide insights into drug activity. Follow-on Phase 1b clinical trials may also evaluate efficacy with respect to trial participants.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials:    Phase 2 clinical trials are carried out on a relatively small number of patients (generally up to several hundred) in a specific indication. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated to preliminarily assess efficacy, to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and to determine optimal dose, regimens, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and dose response relationships. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning Phase 3 clinical trials.
Phase 3 Clinical Trials:    Phase 3 clinical trials involve tests on a much larger population of patients (several hundred to several thousand patients) suffering from the targeted condition or disease. These trials are undertaken to confirm proof of concept and further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety and are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or foreign authorities for approval of marketing applications.
Post-Approval Clinical Trials:    Phase 4 clinical trials or other post-approval commitments may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval. 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trial must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or for any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety and monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's or ethics committee's requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Pharmaceutical Review and Approval Process
Upon completion of pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies, the sponsor assembles all the product development, preclinical and clinical data along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, and submits it to the FDA as part of an NDA. If accepted by the FDA as substantially complete to permit substantive review, the submission or application is then reviewed for approval to market the product. This process takes eight months to one year to complete, but in some cases may take longer. At the end of the review period the FDA may issue a Complete Response Letter, refusing to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or requiring additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
Accelerated Approval
Accelerated Approval is a program that is intended to make promising products for life threatening diseases available on the basis of evidence of effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase 4 clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect of the clinical endpoint.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any pharmaceutical products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the 
FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product's approved labeling (known as "off-label use"), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
As part of our clinical development plans, we are exploring the use of companion diagnostics to identify patients most likely to respond to our product candidates. Companion diagnostics are classified as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the United States. In the United States, the FDA regulates the medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, reporting, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, export and import, sales and distribution, and post-market surveillance of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostics require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval ("PMA").
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the cancer treatment to obtain a 510(k) clearance or PMA simultaneously with approval of the drug. Based on the draft guidance, and the FDA's past treatment of companion diagnostics, we believe that the FDA will require a PMA for one or more companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for our product candidates. The review of these companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our product candidates involves coordination of review by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such products and services. There is no uniform coverage and reimbursement policy among third-party payors in the United States; however, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices that are lower than they would otherwise be. Recently, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our product candidates to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each 
third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenue and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
Foreign Regulation

In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Further, we will be required to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any companion diagnostic tests that we develop separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement we seek for our product candidates, once approved.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements

Several other types of state and federal laws restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment, sunshine, patient protection and affordable care, privacy and security laws and regulations, as well as laws and regulations regarding providing drug samples. In addition, there have been a number of substantial legislative and regulatory changes to the way healthcare is financed and paid for by both governmental and private insurers, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”). There has been, and continues to be, significant developments in, and continued legislative activity around the ACA and related laws. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
We may in the future be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 (“FCPA”). The FCPA and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with United States or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits and other legal or equitable sanctions.
Other Laws
In addition to the above, we are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Exchange, on which our shares are traded. We are also subject to various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals.
