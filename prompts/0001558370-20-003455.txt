 Item 1.  Business
 Corporate Overview
 We own a portfolio of consumer brands in the active and lifestyle categories, including, Jessica Simpson, AND1, Avia, Joe’s and GAIAM. We aim to maximize the value of our brands by promoting, marketing and licensing the brands through various distribution channels, including to retailers, wholesalers and distributors in the United States and in certain international territories. Our core strategy is to enhance and monetize the global reach of our existing brands, and to pursue additional strategic acquisitions to grow the scope of and diversify our portfolio of brands.
 Our business is designed to maximize the value of our brands through license agreements with partners that are responsible for manufacturing and distributing our licensed products. Our brands are licensed for a broad range of product categories, including apparel, footwear, fashion accessories and home goods. We seek to select licensees who have demonstrated the ability to produce and sell quality products in their respective licensed categories and have the capability to meet or exceed the minimum sales thresholds and guaranteed minimum royalty payments that we generally require.
 We license our brands to both wholesale and direct-to-retail licensees. In a wholesale license, a wholesale supplier is granted rights (typically on an exclusive basis) to a single or small group of related product categories for a particular brand for sale to multiple accounts within an approved channel of distribution and territory. In a direct-to-retail license, a single retailer is granted the right (typically on an exclusive basis) to sell branded products in a broad range of product categories through its brick and mortar stores and e-commerce sites. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately one hundred licensees, with wholesale licensees comprising a significant majority.
 Strategy
 We own, manage, and maximize the long-term value of a diversified portfolio of global consumer brands. We aim to acquire well-known consumer brands with high potential for growth and strong brand awareness. We additionally seek to diversify our portfolio by evaluating the strength of targeted brands and the expected viability and sustainability of future royalty streams. Upon the acquisition of a brand, we partner with leading wholesalers and retailers to drive incremental value and maximize brand equity. We focus on certain key initiatives in our licensing and brand management business. These initiatives include:
· | Maximizing the value of our existing brands by creating efficiencies, adding additional product categories, expanding distribution and retail presence and optimizing sales through innovative marketing that increases consumer brand awareness and loyalty;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expanding through e-commerce channels;
--+---------------------------------------


· | Developing international expansion through additional licenses, partnerships and other arrangements with leading retailers and wholesalers outside the United States; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Acquiring consumer brands (or the rights to such brands) with high consumer awareness, broad appeal and applicability to a wide range of product categories.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Licensing Relationships
 Our license agreements typically require a licensee to pay us royalties based upon net sales and, in most cases, contain guaranteed minimum royalties. Our license agreements also require licensees to support the brands by either paying or spending contractually guaranteed minimum amounts for the marketing and advertising of the respective licensed brands. As of March 23, 2020, we had contractual rights to receive an aggregate of $208.3 million in minimum royalty and marketing and advertising revenue from our licensees through the balance of the current terms of such licenses, excluding any renewals.

 Our license agreements stipulate specific geographical territories and distribution channels in which the licensed products may be sold. Currently, the majority of our revenues are from license agreements with stipulated distribution territories in the United States. As we grow our existing brands and acquire new brands, we intend to increase the share of our international revenue, primarily through additional licenses, partnerships and other arrangements.
 Our licensing revenues are concentrated with certain licensees and retail partners. During the year ended December 31, 2019, three licensees represented at least 10% of net revenue, accounting for 19%, 16% and 14% of the Company’s net revenue from continuing operations. For additional information, see “Risk Factors Risks Related to our Business - A substantial portion of our licensing revenue is concentrated with a limited number of licensees and retail partners, such that the loss of a licensee or retail partner could materially decrease our revenue and cash flows” in Item 1A.

 Corporate Organization/Information 
 We were formed in June 2015 in connection with a strategic combination resulting in our predecessors, Sequential Brands Group, Inc. (“Old Sequential”) and MSLO, becoming our wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Mergers”).  Old Sequential was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1982 as People’s Liberation, Inc. and changed its name to Sequential Brands Group, Inc. in 2012.  Old Sequential's common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker “SQBG” on September 24, 2013, and we succeeded to Old Sequential’s listing on December 7, 2015.
 On June 10, 2019, we completed the sale of MSLO, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for $166 million in cash consideration, plus additional amounts in respect of pre-closing accounts receivable that are received after the closing, subject to certain adjustments, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with the Buyer entered into on April 16, 2019.  In addition, the Purchase Agreement provides for an earnout of up to $40,000,000 payable to Sequential if certain performance targets are achieved during the three calendar years ending December 31, 2020, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022.  MSLO and its subsidiaries were engaged in the business of promoting, marketing and licensing the Martha Stewart and the Emeril Lagasse brands through various distribution channels.

 Due to the sale of MSLO during the second quarter of 2019 (see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K), in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205, Discontinued Operations, we have classified the results of MSLO as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for all periods presented.  Additionally, the related assets and liabilities directly associated with MSLO are classified as held for disposition from discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.  All amounts included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements relate to continuing operations unless otherwise noted.
 Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive market, both for our individual brands and for the Company as a whole.
 Our brands are subject to extensive competition from various domestic and foreign brands. Each of our brands has a number of competitors within its specific product categories and distribution channels that compete with the product categories and distribution channels in which our brands’ products are sold. Our brands also compete within the retail stores and other distribution channels that carry such brand’s product lines with other products offered by these retail stores and distribution channel in the respective product categories, including with products sold under our partners’ private labels. We also compete with the e-commerce businesses of these stores and other websites that sell similar retail goods. Competitive factors include design, style, quality, price, name recognition, service and advertising.
 In addition, we face competition in establishing and maintaining licensee relationships for our existing brands. Competitors may seek to enter into brand licensing arrangements with our current or potential licensees, which may inhibit our ability to enter into or maintain licensing arrangements. In addition, the retailers that currently sell our branded products may develop their own brands or acquire brands rather than purchase products from our licensees, which could make it more difficult for our licensees to achieve their sales targets.
 We also compete with traditional apparel and consumer brand companies, as well as other brand management companies, for acquisitions of accretive brands, particularly brands with high consumer awareness, broad appeal and applicability to a wide range of product categories.
 Trademarks
 Our trademarks and associated marks are registered or pending registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in block letter and/or logo formats, as well as in combination with a variety of ancillary marks for use with respect to a broad range of product categories, including footwear, apparel, fragrance, handbags, backpacks, watches, home goods and various other goods and services. We intend to renew these registrations as appropriate prior to their expiration. In addition, we register our trademarks in other countries and regions around the world. We also have domestic, foreign and international intellectual property coverage for the technology and designs for several brands including for Heelys wheeled footwear and certain Gaiam yoga-related products and SPRI products. We own the rights to 39 U.S. issued patents and 42 foreign issued patents within 24 territories.
 We monitor on an ongoing basis unauthorized use and filings of our trademarks and patents and rely primarily upon a combination of federal, state and local laws, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property rights, both domestically and internationally.
 Employees
 As of March 23, 2020, we had a total of 42 employees and area-specific consultants working to support our operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.
