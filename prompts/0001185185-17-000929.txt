Item 1. Business
Our Company
 
 Nova LifeStyle, Inc. (“Nova LifeStyle” or the “Company”) is a broad based distributor and retailer of contemporary styled residential furniture incorporated into a dynamic marketing and sales platform offering retail as well as online selection and purchase fulfillment globally.  We monitor popular trending and work to create design elements that are then integrated into our product lines that can be used as both stand-alone or whole-room and home furnishing solutions.  Through our global network, Nova LifeStyle also sells (through an exclusive third party manufacturing partner) a managed variety of high quality bedding foundation components.
 
Nova LifeStyle’s brand family currently includes Diamond Sofa (www.diamondsofa.com), Colorful World, Giorgio Mobili, and Bright Swallow.
 
Our customers principally consist of distributors and retailers having specific geographic coverages that deploy middle to high end private label home furnishings having very little competitive overlap within our specific furnishings products or product lines.  Nova LifeStyle is constantly seeking to integrate new sources of distribution and manufacturing that are properly aligned with our growth strategy, thus allowing us to continually focus on building both same store sales growth as well as drive the expansion of our overall distribution and manufacturing relationships through a deployment of popular, as well as trend-based furnishing solutions worldwide.


We traditionally generated the majority of our sales serving as a trading company and vertically integrated manufacturer for global furniture distributors and large national retailers.  In the U.S. and international markets, we focus on establishing and expanding long term relationships with our customers by providing large scale and cost-effective sourcing in China.  Our logistics and delivery capabilities provide our customers with the flexibility to select from our extensive furniture collections in their respective shipments. Our experience developing and marketing products for international markets has enabled us to develop the scale, logistics and marketing efficiencies and design expertise that serves as the foundation for us to expand aggressively into the highly attractive U.S., Canadian, European, Australian and Middle Eastern markets. 
 
Our History
 
 We are a U.S. holding company with no material assets other than the ownership interests of our wholly owned subsidiaries through which we market, design, and sell residential furniture worldwide: Nova Furniture Limited in the British Virgin Islands (“Nova Furniture”), Nova Furniture Limited in Samoa (“Nova Samoa”), Nova Furniture Macao Commercial Offshore Limited (“Nova Macao”), Bright Swallow International Group Limited (“Bright Swallow”), and Diamond Bar Outdoors, Inc. (“Diamond Bar”). Nova Macao was organized under the laws of Macao on May 20, 2006. Nova Macao is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nova Furniture.  Diamond Bar, doing business as Diamond Sofa, is a California corporation organized on June 15, 2000, which we acquired pursuant to a stock purchase agreement on August 31, 2011.  On April 24, 2013, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Bright Swallow; the purchase price was $6.5 million in cash and was fully paid at the closing of the acquisition. 
 
On October 24, 2013, Nova Furniture (Dongguan) Co., Ltd. (“Nova Dongguan”) incorporated Dongguan Ding Nuo Household Products Co., Ltd. (“Ding Nuo”) under the laws of the PRC and contributed capital of RMB 1 million ($162,994). Nova Dongguan made an additional capital contribution of RMB 0.1 million ($16,305) on November 27, 2013 through one of Nova Dongguan’s officers, Mr. Gu Xing Chang, who acted as the nominee shareholder of Ding Nuo.


 On September 23, 2016, Nova Furniture, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Seller”), entered into a Share Transfer Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Kuka Design Limited, an unrelated company incorporated in British Virgin Islands (“Kuka Design BVI” or “Buyer”). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Seller sold all of the outstanding equity interests in Nova Dongguan, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Seller, to the Buyer for a total of $8,500,000 (the “Transaction”), which such value was primarily derived from Nova Dongguan and Nova Donguan’s wholly owned subsidiary, Nova Museum, and 90.97% owned subsidiary, Ding Nuo. Upon consummation of the Transaction on October 25, 2016, the Buyer became the sole owner of Nova Dongguan.
 
On November 10, 2016, Nova Furniture (“Assignor”) entered into a Trademark Assignment Agreement with Kuka Design BVI (“Assignee”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Trademark Assignment Agreement, Assignor agreed to assign to the Assignee its full right to, and title in, the NOVA trademark in China for $6,000,000 (the “Assignment Fee”).  Assignee was to pay the Assignment Fee in two installments: $1,000,000 on or before November 30, 2016, and $5,000,000 on or before December 31, 2016.  As of December 31, 2016, $4,750,000 had been received, and the remaining balance of $1,250,000 was received in January 2017.
 
As a result, the operations of Nova Dongguan, Nova Museum and Ding Nuo are now accounted for as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
 
In the previous reports filed with SEC, the Company erroneously reported that Nova Samoa, another wholly-owned subsidiary entered into the Agreement and the Trademark Assignment Agreement with Kuka Design BVI and sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of Nova Furniture to Kuka Design BVI and assigned the right to, and title in, the NOVA trademark in China to Kuka Design BVI.

Our organizational structure is set forth in the following diagram:



Our Products
 
We market and develop modern home furniture for today’s middle class, urban consumer in diverse markets worldwide. Our product offerings feature urban contemporary styles offering comfort and functionality in matching furniture collections and upscale luxury pieces appealing to lifestyle-conscious middle and upper middle-income consumers. Many of our products are part of multi-piece lifestyle collections in distinctive styles targeted at the medium and upper-medium price ranges and feature upholstered, wood and metal-based residential furniture pieces. We classify our products by room;
 or series, including living room, dining room, bedroom and home office, and by category or piece such as sofas, chairs, dining tables, beds, entertainment consoles, cabinets and cupboards. Our largest selling product categories in the year ended December 31, 2016 were sofas, beds and dining tables, which accounted for approximately 61%, 11% and 7% of 2016 sales, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our largest selling product categories were sofas, dining tables and beds, which accounted for approximately  36%, 15% and 14% of sales, respectively, of 2015 sales. Our products are manufactured primarily from medium-density fiberboard, or MDF board, and particleboard covered with veneers or lacquers and combined with other materials, including steel, glass, marble, leather and fabrics.

Our product offerings consist of a mix of furnishings designed by us and sourced from third party manufacturers. Through market research, customer feedback, and ongoing design development; we identify new trends and customer needs in our target markets for incorporation into new products, collections and brands. Our products and collections are designed to appeal to consumer preferences in specific markets. We develop both individual pieces and collections for entire rooms, which feature matching furniture suites, providing convenient whole-home furnishing options for lifestyle-conscious end consumers. We generally introduce new collections and styles by participating in international furniture exhibitions and through our sample rooms, and support new product launches with promotions, product brochures and online marketing. Our staff works with customers worldwide to design store and showroom layouts that highlight our matching furniture collections by displaying complete and fully accessorized room settings instead of individual furniture pieces. We believe that this style of presentation in stores encourages consumers to purchase an entire room of furniture instead of individual pieces from different brands or manufacturers. We source finished products based on our designs or those of our customers from third party manufacturers to fulfill orders placed by customers in international markets. We believe that our products feature the quality, appearance, functionality and price points sought by today’s middle to upper middle-income consumers in the U.S., Europe, Australia and the Middle East.
 
International Markets
 
We sell products to the U.S., Canadian, Australian, European and Middle Eastern markets under the Diamond Sofa brand and as a trading company. The markets in the U.S. and Europe remain challenging because they are experiencing a slower than anticipated recovery from the recent international financial crisis and the Euro-area crisis in particular. We believe that discretionary purchases of furniture by middle to upper middle-income consumers, our target global consumer market, will increase along with the expected growth in the worldwide furniture trade and recovery of housing markets. Furthermore, we believe that furniture featuring modern and contemporary styling such as ours will continue to be in greater demand.
 
In 2016, our products were sold in over 18 countries worldwide, with North America and Europe our principal international markets, while we expanded our sales in other regions Sales to North America accounted for 62.8% and 83.9% of sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to Europe accounted for 13.5% and 11.8% of sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively, with the increase attributed principally to the recovery of the Euro-area economic climate and our changing sales and marketing strategy to diversify international sales. Sales to other regions, primarily in Asia and Australia, accounted for 23.7% and 4.3% of total sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. As we continue to expand our broad network of distributors, increase direct sales and enter emerging growth markets, we believe that we are well positioned to respond to changing market conditions, allowing us to take advantage of any upturns in the global and local economies of the markets we serve.
 
Our logistics and delivery capabilities provide our customers with the flexibility to select from our extensive furniture collections in their respective shipments. We design and supply our products for direct sales to private label retailers worldwide and for global furniture distributors and wholesalers that in turn offer our products to retailers under their own brand names, including Actona Company (Denmark), Artemis (Australia), BUT International (France), Dormitienda (Spain) and El Dorado Furniture (United States). We offer a wide selection of stand-alone pieces across a variety of product categories and approximately 20 product collections developed exclusively for international markets.  During 2017, we expect to focus on both online and offline sales.  We also sell products under the Diamond Sofa brand to distributors and retailers in North America and South America and to end-user consumers in the U.S. market through third-party shopping portals. Our research and development team works with our customers to modify our existing product designs and create new designs and styles for their market’s particular requirements. We believe that we can continue to expand our sales in the U.S. and international markets as we integrate the Diamond Sofa brand and increase our direct sales to retailers and chain stores as we expand and explore new markets worldwide.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our sales and marketing strategies target middle class, urban consumers, including: (1) increasing direct sales in the U.S. and internationally; (2) internet sales and online marketing; and (3) participation in trade exhibitions.

We plan to increase our direct sales to retailers and chain stores in the U.S. and international markets as we continue to diversify our customer base from global furniture distributors. In August 2011, we acquired Diamond Bar, a California importer and marketer of modern home furniture in North and South America. Diamond Bar markets and sells products under the Diamond Sofa brand to distributors and retailers principally in the U.S. market. We plan to continue expanding sales of the Diamond Sofa brand in the U.S., Mexico and South America markets through Diamond Bar’s longstanding customer relationships and distribution capabilities. Through our relationship with St. Joyal, a California-based corporation specializing in business development, management and organizational planning and an investor in us and our subsidiary, Nova Furniture, we plan to continue expanding our direct sales and marketing efforts in North America, and in particular the U.S., which historically is the largest market worldwide for sales of imported furniture. St. Joyal has extensive business contacts with U.S. domestic furniture wholesalers and retailers, through which we have been introduced to some of our current customers in the U.S. In addition, we plan to expand our existing presence in the U.S. market as we integrate the business of Diamond Bar, grow our U.S.-based management and sales team and focus on the expansion of our existing showrooms featuring the Diamond Sofa brand. We intend to develop the Diamond Sofa brand and introduce new brands for our direct sales in the U.S. and international markets while continuing to supply products under private label brands to retailers and chain stores.
 
Our acquisition of Bright Swallow International Group Limited (“Bright Swallow”), an established furniture company with a global client base, was finalized in late April of 2013, and Bright Swallow has become an integral part of the Nova LifeStyle brand family. Bright Swallow posted revenues of just over $6.90 million and $5.92 million for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, and its complementary product line and geographical reach has offered Nova LifeStyle an ideal opportunity to expand its overall global market presence.  One of Bright Swallow’s current clients, Canada-based The Brick Limited (www.TheBrick.com) has over 200 locations and provides an excellent example of this exceptional integration opportunity. Nova LifeStyle has primary management for the operation of Bright Swallow and under the terms all issued and outstanding shares of Bright Swallow were transferred to Nova by Bright Swallow’s sole owner, Mr. Zhu Wei for an aggregate purchase price of $6.5 million in cash.
 
Diamond Bar currently sells products under the Diamond Sofa brand in the U.S. through third party shopping portals, shipping orders received online direct to the end customer.  We believe that our planned direct-to-consumer online sales and marketing strategies will increase our sales in the U.S. by building our brand awareness and acting as an effective advertising vehicle. We also support new product collections and brand launches with print and online advertising campaigns, participation in furniture exhibitions and offering of product brochures and samples. We provide samples and brochures of new products for international markets to distributors and buyers, as is common in the furniture industry.
 
We generally gain new customers in the international markets and introduce new product collections and styles by participating in and attending international furniture exhibitions throughout the year. We believe this marketing process gives us greater insight into developing tastes and trends in the marketplace and helps us better understand the challenges facing the distributors and buyers with whom we do the majority of our international business. Historically, we have exhibited our products at the International Famous Furniture Fair (3F) in Dongguan, China and the China International Furniture Exhibition in Shanghai, China. We have also shown our products under the Diamond Sofa brand at the Las Vegas Market (U.S.) and High Point Market (U.S.) and at furniture exhibitions worldwide in connection with our customers Actona Company at IMM Cologne (Germany) and Yeh Brothers at Interiors Birmingham (United Kingdom). We anticipate attending and exhibiting at additional furniture exhibitions to meet new distributors and buyers as we expand and explore emerging international markets, such as the Middle East. We maintain showrooms to highlight our latest collections at Diamond Bar’s headquarters in California and at High Point Market and Las Vegas Market.
 
Suppliers and Manufacturers
 
We source finished goods from third-party manufacturers to fulfill orders placed by customers through Nova Macao and Diamond Bar for the U.S. and international markets. Our principal suppliers of finished goods in 2016 were Zhejiang Luxury Trading Company Limited, Kuka Design Ltd. and Yin Tong Furniture Limited accounting for approximately 22.0%, 18.5% and 16.5% of our total purchases, respectively. By maintaining relationships with multiple suppliers, we benefit from a more stable supply chain and more competitive prices. If a change of suppliers is necessary, we believe that we can quickly fulfill our requirements from other suppliers without impacting order fulfillment.  We monitor our suppliers’ ability to meet our product needs and we participate in quality assurance activities to reinforce adherence to our quality standards. Our third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration, or manufactured products are sourced on the basis of individual purchase orders. Our manufacturing relationships are non-exclusive, and we are permitted to procure our products from other sources at our discretion. None of our manufacturing contracts include production volume or purchase commitments on the part of either party. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the sourcing of raw materials and producing parts and finished products to our specifications. We hold our suppliers to strict quality and delivery specifications. Our quality control procedures include quality assurance of raw materials used in the production of our products, which includes an evaluation and selection of established and reputable suppliers.

Customers
 
Our target end customer is the middle and upper middle-income consumer of residential furniture. In the U.S. and international markets, our sales principally are to furniture distributors and retailers who in turn offer our products under their own brands or under our Diamond Sofa brand. Our largest customers in 2016 were Shanxi Wanqing Senior Care Service, Group and Actona Company A/S, a global furniture distributor, which accounted for 10.8% and 9.7% of our total sales in 2016, respectively. Our two largest customers in 2015 were Actona Company A/S and Encore Sofa Inc., which in total accounted for 11.8% of our sales in 2015. No other individual customer accounted for greater than 10% of our sales in 2016 or 2015. We plan to increase direct sales to retailers and chain stores worldwide as we continue to diversify our customer base from global furniture distributors.
 
We are focusing on establishing and growing long-term relationships with our customers. We believe that the majority of our customers view us as a strategic long-term supplier and value the quality of our products, our timely delivery and design capabilities. We generally negotiate renewable supplier agreements with firm pricing on our products, typically for a term of one year, as is customary in the furniture industry, with individual orders made on standard purchase orders. Our sales to customers outside of China were $82.64 million in 2016, as compared to $89.94 million in 2015, accounting for 89% of sales in 2016 and 100% in 2015. In 2016, we sold products into approximately 18 countries worldwide, with North America and Europe as our principal international markets, while we expanded our sales in other regions. Sales to North America accounted for 63% and 84% of sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to Europe accounted for 13% and 12% of sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively, with the decrease attributed principally to the challenging Euro-area economic climate and our changing sales and marketing strategy to diversify international sales. Sales to other regions, primarily in Asia and Australia, accounted for 24% and 4% of our total sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect that a majority of our sales will continue to come from our sales to the U.S. and international markets. We acquired Diamond Bar in August 2011, which has driven expansion of our sales to the U.S., Mexico, and South America through Diamond Bar’s longstanding customer relationships and distribution capabilities. It should be noted that Diamond Bar accounted for 53.7% and 43.5% of Nova Lifestyle’s total sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and Nova Macao’s revenues accounted for 38.8% and 49.9% of Nova Lifestyle’s total sales in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  In addition, we anticipate increasing internet sales under the Diamond Sofa brand through third-party shopping portals. We believe that as we expand our broad network of distributors and increase direct sales, our exposure to regional recessions will be reduced and allow us to better capitalize on emerging market trends.
 
We typically experience stronger fourth and first calendar quarters as our product sales are subject to the seasonality and fluctuations typical of the furniture industry. This industry-based seasonality generally is caused by shipping lead-times to international markets combined with the real estate market slowdown and decrease in furniture consumption commonly experienced during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere markets in which the majority of our customers are located and our products sell at retail. In addition, we believe that consumer demand for furniture generally reflects sensitivity to overall economic conditions, including, but not limited to, unemployment rates, housing market conditions and consumer confidence.
 
Competition
 
The residential furniture industry is highly competitive, consisting of a large number of manufacturers, distributors and retailers, none of which dominates the fragmented and diverse market. Our products principally compete in the U.S., China, Europe and Australia. The primary competitive factors in these markets for our product price points and target consumers are price, quality, style, marketing, functionality and availability.
 
In the U.S. and international markets, we compete against other furniture distributors and wholesalers, most of which are located in China and other Southeast Asian countries, and against traditional distributors in North America and Europe. We believe that we are competitive with North American and European distributors because we have a history of prompt delivery of quality products and offer approximately 30 distinct product collections that we developed for international markets at comparable prices and with styles and functionality similar to those offered by our competitors. We coordinate the efforts of our sales and marketing team to receive feedback from customers as part of our ongoing research and design of products. This research process allows us to develop and modify products to meet the varied and changing stylistic and functional demands of our customers worldwide. We believe that our experience and proven performance provides us with a competitive edge over other manufacturers for the U.S. and international markets. In addition to our design and logistical capabilities, we believe that our ability and experience at sourcing products for distributors to the U.S. and international markets are significant competitive advantages. We expanded our presence in the North American market through our acquisitions of Diamond Bar in August 2011 and Bright Swallow in 2013, whereby we anticipate further increasing our direct sales to North American retailers through Diamond Bar’s and Bright Swallow’s longstanding customer relationships and distribution capabilities.

Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 
Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations both domestically and abroad. In the U.S., federal, state and local regulations impose standards on our workplace and our relationship with the environment. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may impact our operations. In particular, we are subject to legislation placing restrictions on our generation, emission, treatment, storage and disposal of materials, substances and wastes. Such legislation includes: the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response and the Compensation and Liability Act (also known as Superfund). We are also subject to the requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, in addition to regulations concerning employee health and safety matters.  Although compliance with federal, state, local and international environmental legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cash flows in the past, there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such environmental matters in the future.
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on the patent and trademark protection laws in the U.S. to protect our intellectual property and maintain our competitive position in the marketplace. We and our subsidiaries hold two trademarks registered in the U.S. related to the Diamond Sofa brand. We acquired all rights, title and interest in the two registered U.S. trademarks pursuant to a trademark purchase and assignment agreement dated August 31, 2011, from St. Joyal for $0.2 million paid in full at the closing. In addition, we have registered and maintain numerous internet domain names related to our business, including “novalifestyle.com” and “diamondsofa.com”. Collectively, the trademarks and domain names that we and our subsidiaries hold are of material importance to us.
Research and Development
 
We believe that the development of new product designs and functionality is important to our continued success. We actively seek to protect our product designs and brand names under the patent and trademark protection laws in the U.S. and China, but the copying of a product’s appearance is a common and ongoing issue in the furniture industry as manufacturers seek to capitalize on popular designs and features by copying those of their competitors and making subtle changes to avoid infringement claims. To remain competitive, we believe that we must innovate continuously, and we have developed a design process that we believe enables us to better manage the short product life cycle for furniture designs by anticipating and responding quickly to changing consumer preferences. We attend furniture exhibitions worldwide, conduct market research and solicit customer feedback to help us identify new trends and customer needs in our target markets for incorporation into new product designs. We plan to introduce new product collections annually for the U.S. and international markets. We anticipate introducing new products under the Diamond Sofa brand on a quarterly basis for the U.S. market. We assess the success of each product and product collection at least annually in consideration of whether to continue production.
 
We currently perform all design and development related work for our products in-house using computer-aided modeling systems. We have used independent designers in the past for product design work, from which we build prototype furniture pieces for further refinement and testing. In 2016 and 2015, we invested $95,877 and $139,869, respectively, on research and development expense. We may increase future investments in research and development based on our growth and available capital.
 
Furniture Industry Regulations and Standards
 
We and our products are subject to PRC, U.S. and international regulations related to the furniture industry.
 
China has a series of national standards, or the GB and QB standards, that govern certain technical, safety and quality requirements for furniture manufactured in and exported from China. The Standardization Administration of the PRC, or SAC, and the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Light Industrial Products and Art-Crafts, or the CCCLA, develop and revise these national standards relating to the structure, material, size and quality requirements for the many varied categories and classifications of upholstered, wood and metal-based furniture. Many of these standards are not compulsory, but manufacturers typically follow all applicable recommended standards.
 
 6
 

Our products are also subject to the mandatory and voluntary furniture test standards of the U.S. and international markets in which our products are distributed to end consumers, including those developed by the American National Standards Institute, or ANSI, Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer’s Association, or BIFMA, ASTM International, California Air Resources Board, or CARB, Furniture Industry Research Association, or FIRA, and the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO. These environmental, ecological and formaldehyde emission standards and source of origin labeling requirements are national or international, with the U.S. and European Union typically having the strictest standards for their markets. We manufacture all products to customer specifications and we believe that our products meet all currently applicable national and international furniture test standards.
 
Export Laws and Regulations
 
We may be subject from time to time to various PRC governmental regulations related to exportation, including the Customs Law of the PRC and the Regulation of the PRC on the Administration of the Import and Export of Goods. These laws and regulations set out standards and requirements for various aspects of the export and import of goods, customs registration, sanitary registration and inspection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the confiscation of our products for export and proceeds from the sales of non-compliant products, orders for correction, fines, revocation of licenses and, in extreme cases, criminal liabilities. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable PRC laws and regulations related to the exports of our products.
Foreign Currency Regulations
 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations promulgated by the State Council, as amended on August 5, 2008, or the Foreign Exchange Regulations. Under the Foreign Exchange Regulations, the RMB, the national currency of the PRC, is freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for capital account items, such as direct investments, loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, unless the prior approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or the SAFE, is obtained and prior registration with the SAFE is made.
 
On July 4, 2014, the SAFE issued Circular 37, the Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Corporate Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, which became effective as of July 4, 2014. Please refer to “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Business in China – PRC regulations relating to the registration requirements for PRC resident shareholders owning shares in offshore companies may subject our PRC resident shareholders to personal liability and adversely affect our business” for a discussion of Circular 37.
 
On August 29, 2008, the SAFE promulgated Circular 142, the Notice on Perfecting Practices Concerning Foreign Exchange Settlement Regarding the Capital Contribution by Foreign-invested Enterprises, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested company of foreign currency into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. Please refer to “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Business in China – Restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our revenues effectively” for a discussion of Circular 142.
 
Taxation
 
We are subject to transfer pricing regulations in the U.S. because we are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and conduct operations worldwide through our PRC subsidiaries. We assess our potential transfer pricing-related liabilities arising from transactions with Nova Macao on a quarterly basis, and we have taken an additional income tax expense as a reserve based on management’s analysis for estimated tax principal, interest and penalties under  U.S. transfer pricing regulations.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 31 full time employees worldwide.  Our U.S. corporate office and operations employed 28 full-time employees and our locations in Macau and Hong Kong employed a total of 3 full-time employees. We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees.
