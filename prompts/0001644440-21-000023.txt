BUSINESS OVERVIEW
GCP Applied Technologies Inc. is a global provider of construction products and technologies that include admixtures and additives for concrete and cement, the in-transit concrete monitoring and management system, high-performance waterproofing products and specialty construction products. The Company is a leader in its two global operating segments. The Specialty Construction Chemicals ("SCC") operating segment produces concrete admixtures, which enhance the properties of concrete and other cementitious construction materials, cement additives, which improve the performance of Portland cement, the most widely used construction material in the world, as well as in-transit concrete monitoring and management and specialty systems. The Specialty Building Materials ("SBM") operating segment produces building envelope, residential and specialty construction products that protect structures from water, vapor transmission, air penetration and fire damage.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated net sales of $903.2 million, income from continuing operations before income taxes of $137.7 million and net income of $100.7 million. Approximately 48% of our 2020 sales were generated outside of the United States. We operate in more than 30 countries.
Business Strategy
    Our objective is to grow our sales, earnings, and cash flows through the implementation of our business strategies. We strive to deliver value to our various stakeholders, such as our stockholders, customers and employees, and manage our business operations and facilities in a sustainable manner. Our SCC and SBM segments produce and market a portfolio of high-performance products for leading global concrete and cement producers, architects, engineers, developers and contractors. Our products must satisfy our customers’ well-defined performance requirements and design specifications to provide high value, although they typically represent a low percentage of the total cost of our customers’ end-products or projects.
We implement the following growth strategies to accelerate progress toward achieving our objectives:
•Leverage Global Presence and Construction Product Capabilities to Generate Sales Growth — We utilize our worldwide sales and marketing organization, technical service and product support, research and development capabilities, and our manufacturing and sourcing operations to create value for our customers. We expect to make targeted investments to expand our capabilities in product and market segments, technology and data analytics where trends and economic cycles present the best opportunities.
•Maintain Strong Customer Focus — A key aspect of our strategy is to deliver product and technology solutions to our customers that help improve the performance and longevity of their products or the structures they build, as well as the productivity of their manufacturing operations or product application processes. We believe that maintaining a close partnership with our customers, which includes creating efficiencies in our supply chain and manufacturing process and providing on-site technical support, allow us to effectively focus our innovation efforts and respond to changing demands. Our goal is to demonstrate the value we provide, which includes outstanding product performance, technical service and customer service, as well as savings through reduced application cost and improved life-cycle performance.

•Increase Productivity by Optimizing Global Operations and Supply Chain Procurement — Our productivity strategies and processes focus on our global and regional operations, including our global procurement, logistics and other supply chain operations, as well as our general and administrative functions. We have developed procurement and product formulation expertise to manage our product costs and production efficiencies and seek to improve our overall operating cost structure. Product formulations are optimized at our regional and global development labs. These formulations are designed to meet specific customer needs while also considering the costs of different raw material inputs. Our global procurement organization balances local raw material supply with global contracts that maximize our buying power while ensuring our supply requirements. Our global manufacturing network also maximizes production and delivery efficiencies.

•Strategic Initiatives — Consistent with our business strategies, we may seek selective strategic acquisitions, partnerships and alliances to accelerate our customer and geographic penetration, extend our product portfolio, advance our technological capabilities, and bolster our manufacturing capacity and capability or divest businesses that fail to meet our targets or do not fit our long-term strategy.  For example, in 2017, we sold our Darex business, which was a supplier of can and closure sealants for food and beverage, personal care and industrial packaging. 
•Drive Cash Flow to Deliver Long-Term Value to Our Shareholders — Our objective is to grow our revenues, improve our operating margins, and lower our selling general and administrative expenses. By implementing these strategies, we believe we will increase our cash flow which will allow us to invest in product development, research and development activities, strategic acquisitions, technical service and sales organizations, manufacturing operations, and to return excess capital to shareholders over time. 
PRODUCTS AND SEGMENTS
The construction business is cyclical in response to economic conditions, as well as seasonal since it is driven by weather conditions. Demand for our products is primarily driven by global non-residential and infrastructure construction activity and U.S. residential construction activity. We seek to increase profitability and minimize the impact of cyclical downturns in regional economies by introducing technically advanced high-performance products and rationalizing non-profitable geographies.
Specialty Construction Chemicals Operating Segment 
We supply concrete admixtures, polymer fibers and in-transit monitoring and management systems to concrete producers. These products are used to improve the rheology, workability, quality, durability and other engineering properties of concrete, mortar, masonry and other cementitious construction materials. We also supply additives to cement manufacturers that are used to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon dioxide in cement processing, enhance the characteristics of finished cement and improve ease of use. 
Our cement additives and concrete admixtures help improve the environmental footprint of cement and concrete, and help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. Cement manufacturing is a significant source of carbon dioxide as it is energy intensive and the chemical reaction that takes place in the kiln generates carbon dioxide. Our cement additives make the grinding process more energy efficient and allow for use of supplemental cementitious materials. Our concrete additives disperse the cement particles more evenly, improving the workability during placement. For a given strength requirement, less cement produced in the kiln is needed reducing the carbon footprint of the concrete.
We compete with several large international suppliers and regionally with smaller competitors. Competition for our products is based on product performance, technical support, the breadth of our manufacturing and distribution infrastructure and our ability to bring value to our customers in the construction industry. Our major global competitors are MBCC Group and Sika.

SCC consists of two product groups which include concrete and cement.
Concrete
The concrete product group includes concrete and decorative admixtures, as well as in-transit concrete monitoring and management and engineered systems.
Concrete admixtures allow concrete producers to use a limited selection of locally-sourced raw materials, such as cement and aggregates, to produce concrete and meet a wide variety of performance specifications. Our products are based on a set of core platform technologies formulated regionally into admixtures tailored to local end-use requirements. 

Examples of our products include CONCERA® admixtures which enable the production of control flow concrete, a high-flowing, segregation-resistant concrete that allows for easier placement while using conventional mix designs. Our CLARENA®MC admixture product is a chemical additive that mitigates the effects of clay, which helps quarry owners extend the functional lifespan of their property, and, for ready mix producers, adds controllability to concrete containing aggregates with a high clay content. Our recently introduced CLARENA ®RC40 admixture product is an environmentally-friendly solution for recycling and re-using returned concrete which significantly reduces concrete waste for our customers. MIRA® admixtures allow concrete to be produced with a lower amount of water, which improves the compressive strength and the long-term durability of the concrete. ADVA® admixtures enable higher compressive strengths, better slump retention, improved rheology, enhanced air control, superior finishability and robustness across a wide range of materials, including both flowable and self-consolidating concrete. ECLIPSE® admixtures are used to minimize the formation of shrinkage cracks in critical applications, such as bridge decks. STRUX® polymeric fibers are designed to improve the ductility of concrete which is a naturally brittle material. In some cases, STRUX® polymeric fibers may be used to replace steel reinforcement near the surface of concrete that will be exposed to corrosive de-icing salts.
Admixtures for decorative concrete are used to enhance the surface appearance and aesthetics of concrete. PIERI® surface retarders are used to obtain exposed aggregate finishes in precast and cast-in-place concrete, achieving the desired surface appearance. PIERI® release agents allow for the efficient removal of mold forms with a resulting higher-quality concrete surface.
Concrete production monitoring and management systems provide sophisticated process monitoring and control while concrete is in transit to the point of placement. Engineered systems combine proprietary products into high-performance offerings that further reduce installation costs. Our patented concrete production monitoring and management system, sold under the VERIFI® brand name, measures, monitors and manages critical concrete properties and systematically adds water or admixtures to maintain optimum concrete flow properties. Use of VERIFI® also results in increased product quality, lower material costs, optimized mix designs that reduce required cement content, fewer rejected loads resulting in less waste, increased logistics and jobsite efficiencies, and minimization of costly project delays. The use of VERIFI® significantly reduces the carbon footprint of a batch of concrete.
Our patented engineered floor system, which is marketed and sold under the DUCTILCRETE® brand name, enables the placement and long-term performance of smooth and level floors which is a necessity in modern industrial and commercial buildings. The flooring system provides customers with more sustainable, cost-effective, and low-maintenance surfaces with higher load-bearing capacity than traditional construction. The DUCTILCRETE® system is installed by our network of licensed contractors. The system offers labor and time savings while providing customers with higher quality flat floors.
Cement 
Portland cement is the binding agent for concrete. National standards usually dictate the compressive strength and other properties that must be met by cement. Cement additives are used to reduce the energy required to mill cement to the desired fineness and improve the handling characteristics of the powdered material. These products are also used to adjust the performance of Portland cement, permitting our customers to optimize production economics. 
Examples of our products include OPTEVA® HE quality improvers, which are cement additives that provide options for gaining higher early (HE) strength and are particularly effective for challenging cements. TAVERO® VM grinding aid additives help stabilize vertical roller mills during production by reducing water injection requirements and cement pre-hydration, while at the same time improving cement performance by delivering higher strengths and shorter setting time. HEA2® Cement Additives are used around the world to improve the energy efficiency of cement grinding operations. CBA® Cement Additives are used to produce higher cement strength, which provides a high level of process flexibility to cement manufacturers who increasingly seek to reduce the environmental impact of their manufacturing processes. Our additives provide greater flexibility in raw materials, enabling customers to achieve improvements such as reductions in energy use and CO2 emissions.

SBM consists of three product groups which include building envelope, residential building products and specialty construction products.
Building Envelope Products
Building envelope products protect structures from water and help manage air and vapor transmission through building walls. The majority of sales in this product group are waterproofing sheet and liquid applied products that protect commercial structures, residential structures and infrastructure. Our waterproofing products are used in both above-grade and below-grade applications. Above grade, our products protect the material to which they are applied and minimize air and water infiltration into occupied spaces. Below grade, our products enable the construction of structures in challenging sites, such as locations with a high existing water table. Examples of these products include our innovative PREPRUFE® waterproofing sheet membranes, BITUTHENE® self-adhesive rubberized asphalt membrane, and our ELIMINATOR® liquid applied waterproofing system.
We pioneered the pre-applied waterproofing category through the inclusion of GCP's Advanced Bond Technology™ brand in our PREPRUFE® products, a system which now includes pre-applied and post-applied membrane options. Our unique technology allows a waterproofing membrane to be installed on the bottom or on walls of a foundation before concrete is placed. This technology allows waterproofing of walls normally inaccessible during the construction of a building, such as foundations in densely populated cities. Major projects around the world have successfully installed our PREPRUFE® waterproofing systems that continue to gain recognition for waterproofing performance. Our BITUTHENE® product line has a long track record of providing waterproofing in the most challenging conditions. Designers and contractors have relied on BITUTHENE® products for over 40 years and continue to specify our products by using the BITUTHENE® brand name. Our PERM-A-BARRIER® membranes protect the building structure from the damaging effects of the elements. By minimizing air and water vapor flow through the building exterior, PERM-A-BARRIER® membranes prevent premature deterioration of the building envelope and enhance thermal performance of the structure to save energy costs. Our ELIMINATOR® liquid applied waterproofing systems are used to protect and extend the life of bridges. Major bridge projects in North America, Europe and Asia have used our ELIMINATOR® systems over the last 20 years.
Residential Building Products
Residential building products consist of roofing underlayments, flashings and weather barriers. Roofing underlayments are placed below the outermost roof covering, such as shingles, to protect sloped roofs from water damage caused by wind-driven rain and ice dams. Our GRACE ICE & WATER SHIELD® roofing underlayments are known throughout the industry and are sold in North America through a network of distributors. The VYCOR® flashing portfolio consists of high performance self-adhered flashing products that provide premium protection against water infiltration in critical areas such as windows and doors. Our VYCOR® flashing and weather barrier products reduce the risk of mold and rot development, and contribute to energy efficiency by sealing air leakages in the building envelope.
Specialty Construction Products
Specialty construction products include fire protection, chemical injection systems and grouts, cementitious grouts and mortars, as well as specialty flooring products. Passive fire protection products are marketed under the MONOKOTE® brand. MONOKOTE® products reduce the rate of temperature rise in steel or concrete in the event of a fire, thereby prolonging the structural integrity of the building. Chemical injection systems and grouts are sold under the DE NEEF® brand and are used for repairing cracks in concrete, sealing water leaks in commercial buildings and infrastructure and stabilizing soil. BETEC® cementitious grouts and mortars are used in applications where specific strength and/or flow are required. Examples of these applications include assembly of concrete precast elements for wind turbines, filling under rails for railroads and providing a high-strength surface for heavy machinery in industrial settings. Our KOVARA® flooring membrane is a moisture mitigation membrane installed between a concrete subfloor and surface flooring to protect the finished flooring from moisture and alkalinity related damage.

SALES AND MARKETING
Our two operating segments maintain global direct sales and technical service teams supporting customers in over 120 countries worldwide. Our global team sells products under annual and multi-year global, regional and local agreements and has developed deep segment and product application knowledge. We believe that our in depth understanding of our customers' needs, challenges and operations, as well as our ability to provide service at a high standard throughout the world, give both of our segments a competitive advantage. The majority of our products require local, regional, country and international code approvals related to their use, storage and performance. Our commercial organization supports and consults on committees and technical associations in order to ensure codes and product standards are consistently applied.
Our sales professionals, supported by a field-based technical service team, work with leading architects, engineers, consultants and contractors across the globe seeking to have our products specified for use in thousands of projects on an annual basis. Our products have been used to build some of the world's most renowned structures. As part of our "go to market" strategy, the SCC team provides technical services to several thousand concrete and cement production facilities worldwide. In many cases, we also provide product dispensing equipment to our customers as an integral part of the concrete and cement production process.
MANUFACTURING, RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLY CHAIN
Our operating segments share global supply chain procurement processes, manufacturing facilities, as well as technical service and sales centers around the world, which provides cost efficiency.
We utilize internal and third-party manufacturing to produce our products to our specifications. Our low capital intensive plants along with third-party manufacturers provide us with flexibility in servicing our customers. Several of our plants ship products internationally, but most of our facilities are positioned to serve local market demand. We have the ability to respond quickly to changes in local demand by establishing or expanding manufacturing capacity with low capital investment. We have numerous multi-year supply and purchasing agreements with both our vendors and customers which helps us minimize volume disruptions. Construction demand is seasonal, resulting in demand variations requiring effective management of our manufacturing and distribution assets. For many of our SCC customers, we install and maintain a chemical dispensing and storage system for our products at their production facilities. We periodically replenish the on-site systems to give our customers instant access to our SCC products in the amounts they require twenty-four hours a day. We also install equipment on ready-mix trucks to monitor and manage concrete in transit to job sites. Total customer-based equipment accounted for approximately 44% of our 2020 annual capital spend.
The raw materials we use in our products are obtained from a variety of suppliers, including basic chemical and petrochemical producers. Many of our raw materials are organic chemicals derived from olefins, including specialty films and fibers. We also make significant purchases of inorganic materials, such as lignin and specialty materials, including plasticizers, films, ethylene derivatives, and rubber. We strive to have multiple raw material sources and balance our purchasing requirements between local and global sources seeking to maximize performance and profitability. Global supply and demand factors, changes in currency exchange rates and petroleum prices can significantly impact the price of our key raw materials.
Our global procurement team monitors the global market to identify cost and productivity opportunities. We seek to leverage our overall purchasing volumes for all regions. Since we manufacture in multiple global locations, some of our products rely on raw materials from suppliers from other regions. Changes in the values of these regions' currencies compared to the U.S. dollar and the euro may adversely affect our raw material costs. This effect is partially mitigated by our reliance on local sourcing for some raw materials.

We also benefit from technological and commercial advantages protected under trade secret laws, including know-how and other proprietary information related to many of our products, technologies and internal quality control and testing methodologies. Entering 2021, we have over 1,000 active patents and patent applications pending in countries around the world, including over 150 patents or patents pending in the USA alone. We estimate that our filing rate is within the range of 100-125 patent applications globally on an annual basis, including priority filings as well as national stage application filings. The average number of patents filed, pending, granted, and maintained could go up or down from year to year, depending on various factors, some of which may not be within our control. It is our intent to continue to file for patents to protect our proprietary innovations and R&D investments.
Research and development expenses were $17.9 million, $18.4 million and $20.2 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. These amounts include depreciation and amortization expenses related to research and development assets and expenses incurred in funding external research projects. The amount of research and development expenses relating to government- and customer-sponsored projects (rather than projects that we sponsor) was not material during these periods.
ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
We are subject, along with other manufacturers of specialty chemicals, to stringent regulations under numerous regional, national, provincial, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations related to the manufacture, storage, handling, disposal, disposition and stewardship of chemicals and other materials. Environmental laws require that certain responsible parties, as defined in the relevant statute, fund remediation actions regardless of legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. We are involved in response actions to address the presence of hazardous substances or other materials as required by applicable laws. 
We continuously seek to improve our environment, health and safety performance. We have expended funds to comply with environmental and safety laws and regulations and expect to continue to do so in the future. 
HUMAN CAPITAL
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,950 employees globally in more than 30 countries, including union employees, of which approximately 40% are based in the US. Approximately 50 of our manufacturing employees in the United States are represented by five different local collective bargaining groups. We have operated without a labor work stoppage for more than 13 years. We have works councils representing two of the European countries in which we do business covering approximately 150 employees. The vast majority of our employees are full-time employees. 

We conduct a global annual talent review of managers through executive officers to build a sustainable pipeline for talent succession throughout the organization and to identify career development opportunities for employees. We engage in a robust performance management process with goals set by the executive officers and cascaded down throughout the organization. We apply performance ratings that drive compensation decisions as a part of our evolving pay-for-performance culture. We drive training across functions and regions to further develop our employees expertise as a part of our learning environment. We are an equal opportunity employer and apply a competitive recruitment strategy to attract talent from both our industry and beyond to meet our needs for professional and technical talent. Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to be competitive within our industry and local labor markets offering a competitive base pay, annual incentive awards when the individual and the company meet their established goals, and long-term incentives for senior level and strategic roles within GCP. We recognize the diversity of our customers, partners and the communities we work within, and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. Our executive leadership team and Board of Directors exercise oversight of certain human capital matters, including our Inclusion and Diversity programs and initiatives. We conduct an annual employee engagement survey to measure key employee engagement metrics and our executive leadership team oversees the implementation of action plans based on the survey results.
