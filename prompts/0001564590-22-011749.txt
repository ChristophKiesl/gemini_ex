First Seacoast Bancorp
 First Seacoast Bancorp (together with its bank subsidiary, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company”) is the savings and loan holding company for First Seacoast Bank (the “Bank”).  First Seacoast Bancorp conducts its operations primarily through its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Seacoast Bank. At December 31, 2021, First Seacoast Bancorp had total consolidated assets of $487.1 million, loans of $376.6 million, deposits of $393.2 million and stockholders’ equity of $60.5 million. 
 The Company is the federally-chartered holding company for the Bank (formerly named Federal Savings Bank). Effective July 16, 2019, pursuant to a Plan of Reorganization from Mutual Savings Bank to Mutual Holding Company and Stock Issuance Plan, the Bank reorganized into the mutual holding company structure, and the Company completed a concurrent stock offering.
 The Company’s executive offices are located at 633 Central Avenue, Dover, New Hampshire 03820, and the telephone number is (603) 742-4680.  Our website address is www.firstseacoastbank.com. Information on our website is not and should not be considered a part of this annual report. First Seacoast Bancorp is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”). 
 First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC 
 First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC is a federal mutual holding company and will, for as long as it is in existence, own a majority of the outstanding shares of First Seacoast Bancorp’s common stock. At December 31, 2021, 55% of First Seacoast Bancorp’s outstanding shares are owned by First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC.
 First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC’s principal assets are the common stock of First Seacoast Bancorp it received in the reorganization and offering and $100,000 in cash as its initial capitalization. Presently, the only business activity of First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC is its ownership of a majority of First Seacoast Bancorp’s common stock. First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC is authorized, however, to engage in any other business activities that are permissible for mutual holding companies under federal law, including investing in loans and securities. 
 First Seacoast Bank
 First Seacoast Bank, a federally-chartered savings bank headquartered in Dover, New Hampshire, has served residents of the Seacoast area of New Hampshire since 1890. Our business consists primarily of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank, in one- to four-family residential real estate loans, commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans, acquisition, development and land loans, commercial and industrial loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans.  In recent years, we have increased our focus, consistent with what we believe to be conservative underwriting standards, on originating higher yielding commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans.

Our results of operations are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings, and non-interest income largely from customer service fees. The results of operations are also affected by the level of operating expenses, the provision for loan losses, the impact of federal and state income taxes, the relative levels of interest rates and local and national economic activity.
 Investment management services are offered through FSB Wealth Management. FSB Wealth Management is a division of First Seacoast Bank. The division currently consists of two financial advisors who are located at 629 Central Avenue, Dover, New Hampshire, adjacent to our main office. FSB Wealth Management provides access to non-FDIC insured products that include retirement planning, portfolio management, investment and insurance strategies, business retirement plans and college planning to individuals throughout our primary market area. These investments and services are offered through a third-party registered broker-dealer and investment advisor. FSB Wealth Management receives fees from advisory services and commissions on individual investment and insurance products purchased by clients.
 The assets held for wealth management customers are not assets of the Bank and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Assets under management totaled approximately $88.0 million and $58.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. On August 17, 2021, the Bank entered into a definitive agreement with an investment advisory and wealth management firm (the “seller”) to purchase certain of its client accounts and client relationships for a purchase price of $347,000 (included in other assets at December 31, 2021), of which $172,000 was paid at closing. Each client account has been assigned a value, and as each client transfers to the Bank, 85% of this value will be paid to the seller. By May 31, 2022, or upon mutual agreement that the transition of client accounts is complete, whichever is earlier, the balance of the purchase price will be paid to the seller. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $17.4 million of purchased client accounts are included in total assets under management. The client accounts purchased are recorded as a customer list intangible asset. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization will be reviewed for impairment, at least annually, based on their fair value. Any impairment will be recognized as a charge to earnings and the adjusted carrying amount of the intangible asset will become its new accounting basis. The remaining useful life of the intangible asset will also be evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The Company is amortizing the customer list intangible on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $13,000 of amortization expense was recorded.
 First Seacoast Bank is active in the communities we serve. The Bank makes investments in community development lending and investments in low-income housing all of which strive to improve the communities we serve.  In 2019, First Seacoast Bancorp established First Seacoast Community Foundation, Inc., a charitable foundation dedicated to supporting charitable organizations operating in the Bank’s local community. 
 First Seacoast Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by its primary federal regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

Market Area
 We conduct our operations from four full-service banking offices in Strafford County, New Hampshire and one full-service banking office in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, located in the southeastern part of the state along the New Hampshire Seacoast. We consider our primary lending market area to be Strafford and Rockingham Counties in New Hampshire and York County in southern Maine. 
 The New Hampshire and southern Maine Seacoast region’s economy is fairly diversified, with employment in education, healthcare, government, services, retail and manufacturing sectors. Our Strafford County branches are located in the cities of Dover, Durham, Barrington and Rochester, New Hampshire. Top employment sectors in Strafford County include healthcare, government, education, insurance, retail and textile manufacturing. Our Rockingham County branch is located in the city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Top employment sectors in Rockingham County include healthcare, government, insurance, pharmaceuticals and biotech. Additionally, although we do not have a branch office in York County, Maine, many of our customers work and reside in York County, which is contiguous to Strafford County. Our Dover 
 3

headquarters is conveniently located approximately 65 miles from Boston and less than 50 miles from each of Manchester, New Hampshire and Portland, Maine.
 We view the greater Seacoast region as a primary area for growth, in light of its favorable demographic characteristics, such as a growing population in some relatively affluent markets. At the same time, the attractive features of the region have fostered a highly competitive environment for financial service providers. 
 Competition
 The financial services industry is highly competitive. The Company experiences substantial competition with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, money market funds, credit unions and other non-bank financial service providers in attracting deposits, making loans and attracting wealth management customers. The competing major commercial banks have greater resources that may provide them a competitive advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous branch offices and mount extensive advertising campaigns. The increasingly competitive environment is the result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, additional financial service providers and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers.
 The financial services industry has become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems.
 Some of the Company’s non-banking competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have assets, capital and lending limits greater than that of the Company, greater access to capital markets and offer a broader range of products and services than the Company. These institutions may have the ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and may also be able to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than the Company can offer. 
 Various in-state market competitors and out-of-state banks continue to enter or have announced plans to enter or expand their presence in the market areas in which the Company currently operates. With the addition of new banking presences within our market, the Company expects increased competition for loans, deposits and other financial products and services.  Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in our market area. Our experience in recent years is that many financial institutions in our market area, especially community banks that are seeking to significantly expand their commercial loan portfolios and banks located in lower growth regions in New Hampshire and Maine, have been willing to price commercial loans aggressively in order to gain market share.
 The Company will continue to rely upon local promotional activities, personal relationships established by officers, directors and employees with their customers and specialized services tailored to meet the needs of the communities served. Management believes that it can compete effectively as a result of local market knowledge, local decision making and awareness of customer needs.
 Lending Activities
 Historically, our lending activities have emphasized one- to four-family residential real estate loans, and such loans continue to comprise the largest portion of our loan portfolio. Other areas of lending include commercial real estate loans and multi-family real estate loans, acquisition, development and land loans, commercial and industrial loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans. Subject to market conditions and our asset-liability analysis, we expect to continue to increase our focus on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, in an effort to diversify our overall loan portfolio and increase the overall yield earned on our loans. We compete for loans by offering high quality personalized service, providing convenience and flexibility, providing timely responses on loan applications and by offering competitive pricing of loan products.
 As a financial services provider, we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. While these contractual obligations represent our potential future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make. For additional information, see Note 15 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements of this annual report.

One- to Four-Family Residential Real Estate Loans. Our one- to four-family residential loan portfolio consists of mortgage loans that enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes, substantially all of which are collateralized by the primary residence of the borrower. At December 31, 2021, we had $234.2 million of loans secured by one- to four-family residential real estate, representing 62.4% of our total loan portfolio. Generally, all of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are secured by properties located in the New Hampshire and southern Maine Seacoast region. Purchased loans are secured by properties located in the greater Boston market in a contiguous state. 
 Our one- to four-family residential real estate loans have terms of up to 30 years and are generally underwritten according to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC” or “Freddie Mac”) guidelines in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by Freddie Mac. We refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” To a lesser extent, we also originate loans above the conforming limits, which are referred to as “jumbo loans.” We generally underwrite jumbo loans in a manner similar to conforming loans.
 At December 31, 2021, 96.8% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans. We sell a portion of fixed-rate conforming loans that we originate on a servicing-retained basis. Secondary market investors that purchase our loans may include Freddie Mac, the New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority and other investors.
 6

At December 31, 2021, 3.2% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were adjustable-rate loans. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans have initial repricing terms of one, three or five years. Following the initial repricing term, such loans adjust annually for the balance of the loan term. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans are indexed to the One-Year U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate, plus a margin. The majority of such loans have an annual interest rate adjustment cap of 2.0% and a lifetime adjustment cap ranging from 4.0% to 6.0%. We typically hold our adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in our portfolio.
 Loan-to-value ratios are determined by collateral type and occupancy level. We generally limit the loan-to-value ratios of our mortgage loans without private mortgage insurance to 80%. Loans where the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance may be made in excess of this limit, pursuant to requirements set by the insurance provider. 
 We do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans on permanent one- to four-family residential real estate loans (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as “Option ARM” loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not have a “subprime lending” program for one- to four-family residential real estate loans (i.e. loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories). 
 Generally, residential mortgage loans that we originate include “due-on-sale” clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable if, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance for the benefit of First Seacoast Bank. We also require appropriate insurance coverage on properties securing real estate loans. 
 Commercial Real Estate and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. Consistent with our strategy to diversify our loan portfolio and increase our yield, we have focused on the origination of commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans. At December 31, 2021, we had $81.1 million in commercial real estate and multi-family real estate loans, representing 21.6% of our total loan portfolio. Of this aggregate amount, we had $52.8 million in owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, $19.3 million in non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans and $9.0 million in multi-family real estate loans.
 Our commercial real estate loans are secured by a variety of properties in our primary market area, including retail spaces, distribution centers, office buildings, manufacturing and warehouse properties, convenience stores and other local businesses, without any material concentrations in property type. Our multi-family real estate loans are secured by properties consisting of five or more rental units in our market area, including apartment buildings and student housing. 
 Commercial and multi-family real estate loans generally have higher balances and entail greater credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans. The repayment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions, such as the economic uncertainties of COVID-19, that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial and multi-family real estate than residential properties. If we foreclose on a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be a lengthy process with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial and multi-family real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial. 
 The Company has limited or no direct exposure to industries hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, including oil and gas/energy, credit cards, airlines, cruise ships, arts/entertainment/recreation, casinos and shopping malls. Our exposure to the transportation and hospitality/restaurant industries amounted to less than 5% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021.
 Our commercial and multi-family real estate loans are generally originated as 10-year balloon loans, which reprice after five years and are amortized over 20 years. Interest rates on such loans are generally indexed to the Federal Home Loan Bank Five-Year Regular Classic Rate, plus a margin. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our commercial and multi-family real estate loans is generally 80% of the lower of purchase price or appraised value of the properties securing the loan and generally requires a minimum debt-service coverage ratio of 1.2x. 
 7

We consider a number of factors in originating commercial and multi-family real estate loans. In addition to the debt-service coverage ratio, we evaluate the loan purpose, the quality of collateral and the borrower’s qualifications, experience, credit history, cash flows and financial statements and sources of repayment. Personal guarantees are generally obtained from the principals of closely-held companies. We gather information on environmental risks associated with commercial properties and also require appropriate insurance coverage on properties securing real estate loans. In addition, the borrower’s and guarantor’s financial information is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statement updates. We also purchase and participate in commercial and multi-family real estate loans from other financial institutions. Such loans are subject to the same underwriting criteria and loan approval requirements applied to loans originated by First Seacoast Bank.
 At December 31, 2021, the average loan balance outstanding in the commercial real estate loans portfolio was $381,000, and the largest individual commercial real estate loan outstanding was a $4.0 million participation loan secured by a commercial building. This loan was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, the average loan balance outstanding in the multi-family real estate loans portfolio was $694,000, and the largest individual multi-family real estate loan outstanding was a $4.8 million participation loan secured by a 204-unit property. This loan was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2021. 
 Acquisition, Development and Land Loans. At December 31, 2021, acquisition, development and land loans were $21.4 million, or 5.7%, of our total loan portfolio. These loans consist of residential construction loans, commercial and multi-family real estate construction loans and land loans. At December 31, 2021, the average loan balance outstanding in the acquisition, development and land loan portfolio was $329,000.
 We originate loans to finance the construction or rehabilitation of owner-occupied one- to four-family residential properties to the prospective homeowners primarily located in our market area. Upon completion of construction, such loans convert to permanent mortgage loans. At December 31, 2021, residential construction loan balances were $7.7 million, or 2.0% of our total loan portfolio, with an additional $13.5 million available for advance to borrowers.  Residential construction loans are generally structured as interest-only for nine months, with a loan-to-value ratio generally not exceeding 80% of the appraised value on a completed basis or the loan-to-cost of completion, whichever is less. However, if private mortgage insurance is obtained, we will consider a loan-to-value ratio up to 97%. We work with a third-party construction management firm that reviews each project before we approve the loan and continues to monitor and inspect the project during the construction phase, as disbursements are made. Once the construction project is satisfactorily completed, generally within nine months, the loan will convert to a permanent, amortizing mortgage loan for the remaining term of the loan, generally up to a maximum of 30 years total or 15 years for manufactured homes. The interest rate may be fixed or adjustable. At December 31, 2021, our largest individual residential construction loan outstanding was $589,000, and it was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms. 
 We also originate loans to finance the construction of commercial properties, primarily owner-occupied properties located in our market area. Upon completion of construction, such loans generally convert to permanent commercial mortgage loans. At December 31, 2021, commercial construction loan balances totaled $12.6 million, or 3.4% of our total loan portfolio, with an additional $3.9 million available for advance to borrowers. Commercial real estate construction loans are generally structured as interest-only for up to 18 months, with a loan-to-value of 80% of the appraised value on a completed basis or a loan-to-cost of completion ratio of up to 85%. We also originate commercial constructions loans with an initial loan-to-value ratio of 90% when coupled with the U.S. Small Business Administration 504 Loan program. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we originated two construction loans secured by owner-occupied properties under the Small Business Administration 504 Loan program, with aggregate original principal balances of $1.9 million. We work with a third-party construction management firm that reviews each project before we approve the loan and continues to monitor and inspect the project during the construction phase, as disbursements are made. Once the construction project is satisfactorily completed, generally within 18 months, the loan will convert to a permanent, amortizing mortgage loan for the remaining term of the loan, generally up to a maximum of 20 years total (including the construction phase). The interest rate may be fixed or adjustable. At December 31, 2021, our largest commercial real estate construction loan had an outstanding balance of $3.3 million, and it was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms. 
 Construction loans generally involve greater credit risk than financing improved real estate, because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value before its completion. Risk of loss on a construction loan also depends upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to accurately evaluate the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds 
 8

beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Construction loans also carry the risk that construction will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs.
 We also originate loans to finance the acquisition and development of land. Land development loans are generally secured by vacant land located in our primary market and in process of improvement. At December 31, 2021, land development loan balances were $1.0 million, or 0.3%, of our total loan portfolio. We generally originate commercial land development loans with loan-to-value ratios of up to 70% where all approvals and permits for improvements are already in place and up to 50% where approvals and permits are not yet in place. The maximum construction term is generally 9 months for residential development properties and 18 months for commercial development properties.  At December 31, 2021, our largest land loan had an outstanding balance of $140,000, and it was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms.
 Land development loans generally involve greater credit risk than long-term financing on developed real estate. If a loan is made on property that is not yet approved for the planned development, there is a risk that necessary approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Risk of loss on a land development loan also depends upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of development costs is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Land development loans also carry the risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale of the property to third parties, and the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated.
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. At December 31, 2021, we had $26.9 million of commercial and industrial loans representing 7.2% of our total loan portfolio. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) established a loan program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), which was added to the SBA’s 7(a) loan program by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) (such loans, “PPP loans”). The PPP, a $350 billion program, was designed to aid small- and medium-sized business through federally guaranteed SBA loans distributed through banks. The CARES Act provided that PPP loans are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the SBA. On December 27, 2020, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed, which extended relief provisions contained in the CARES act to the earlier of 60 days after the national emergency termination date or January 1, 2022. This legislation also included a $900 billion relief package and the extension of certain relief provisions from the March 2020 CARES Act that were set to expire at the end of 2020, including the extension of the eviction moratorium and $286 billion of additional PPP funds. The 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act also continued to suspend the requirements under U.S. GAAP for loan modifications related to the COVID–19 pandemic that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) and suspend any determination of a loan modified as a result of the effects of the COVID–19 pandemic as being a TDR, including impairment for accounting purposes. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank originated 134 and 286 PPP loans, respectively, with aggregate principal balances of $13.1 million and $33.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our commercial and industrial loans included 52 and 240 PPP loans, respectively, with aggregate outstanding principal balances of $5.5 million and $21.2 million, respectively. 
 We originate commercial and industrial loans, including equipment loans and business acquisition loans, and lines of credit to businesses operating in our local market area. Our commercial and industrial loans are generally used by the borrowers for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture. Borrowers include professional organizations, family-owned businesses and not-for-profit businesses. These loans are generally secured by non-real estate business and personal assets, including equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and marketable securities, although we may support this collateral with liens on real property such as buildings and equipment. We generally require our commercial business borrowers to maintain their primary deposit accounts with us, which improves our overall interest rate spread and profitability.
 Our commercial and industrial loans include term loans and revolving lines of credit and are made with either variable or fixed rates of interest. Variable interest rates are indexed to the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. Commercial and industrial loans typically have shorter terms to maturity and higher interest rates than commercial real estate loans.
 9

When originating commercial and industrial loans, we consider the financial history of the borrower, the debt service capabilities and cash flows of the borrower and other guarantors and the value of the underlying collateral. We generally require personal guarantees by the principals, as well as other appropriate guarantors, when personal assets are in joint names or a principal’s net worth is not sufficient to support the loan. Commercial and industrial loans can have a loan-to-value ratio of up to 80% of the value of the collateral securing the loan. 
 To assist small businesses with their credit needs for working capital, equipment and new real estate construction or acquisition, we originate commercial and industrial loans under the Small Business Administration 7(a) and Express Guarantee programs. Typically, a 7(a) loan includes a 75% guarantee and an Express loan includes a 50% guarantee from the U.S. Government. At December 31, 2021, we had seven loans outstanding with an aggregate principal balance of $1.7 million with Small Business Administration 7(a) guarantees totaling $1.1 million and 5 Small Business Administration Express loans with an aggregate principal balance of $282,000 with guarantees totaling $141,000.
 We intend to expand our commercial and industrial lending activities in order to diversify our loan portfolio, increase our yield and offer a full range of products to our commercial customers. However, these loans have greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential real estate loans. Our commercial and industrial loans are made based primarily on historical and projected cash flows of the borrower, the borrower’s experience and stability and the value and marketability of the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not materialize as forecasted, and collateral securing loans may fluctuate in value because of economic or individual performance factors. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial and industrial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment in our market area. In addition, commercial and industrial loans often result in larger outstanding balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers, and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts. Accordingly, financial information is obtained from the borrowers to evaluate cash flow sufficiency and is periodically updated during the life of the loan. 
 At December 31, 2021, the average loan balance outstanding in the commercial and industrial loans portfolio was $166,000, and the largest individual commercial and industrial loan outstanding was $3.2 million secured by marketable securities. This loan was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2021. 
 Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We offer home equity loans and lines of credit, which are multi-purpose loans used to finance various home or personal needs, where a one- to four-family primary or secondary residence serves as collateral, generally within our primary market area. At December 31, 2021, outstanding balances on home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $6.9 million, or 1.9% of our total loan portfolio, and the lines of credit had an additional $19.1 million available to draw. 
 Home equity loans are originated as fixed-rate term loans. Home equity lines of credit are tied to the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal and are offered for terms of up to 25 years, with a 10-year draw period and 15-year repayment period. Generally, our home equity loans and lines of credit are originated with loan-to-value ratios of up to 80%, inclusive of existing liens on the property. 
 Consumer Loans. We offer consumer loans to individuals who reside or work in our market area. Consumer lending has historically been a minor area of lending diversification for us. Consumer loans, other than consumer loans secured by manufactured housing properties, generally consist of installment loans extended directly to the borrower. These loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities. It is expected that growth for this segment of our consumer loan portfolio will be limited, with such loans extended primarily to pre-existing First Seacoast Bank customers.
 Additionally, during 2019, we began to purchase consumer loans secured by manufactured housing properties to supplement our consumer loan origination efforts. We purchased $2.0 million and $1.5 million of these loans during 2021 and 2020, respectively. These loans are secured by properties located in the greater Seacoast region. As of December 31, 2021, the portfolio of these loans had aggregate outstanding principal balances of $3.5 million and were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms. We expect that growth in this segment of our consumer loan portfolio will continue to increase in the future. At December 31, 2021, consumer loans totaled $4.6 million, or 1.2% of our total loan portfolio, of which $614,000 was unsecured.

Originations, Sales and Purchases of Loans 
 Our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel operating at our banking office locations. Residential real estate loans are generated by our mortgage loan officers through referrals from real estate brokers, builders, walk-in customers, online applications, participation in local home shows, events with local realtors, contacts in the local community and referrals. Commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans are originated through our commercial lenders, through previous lending relationships, referrals, direct solicitation and participation in industry-specific associations. Additionally, small business lending relationships are generated through our business development officers. Consumer loans are generated largely to existing customers and walk-ins. Loan generation is supported by our advertising campaigns.
 While we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period. 
 We consider our balance sheet, as well as market conditions, on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether to hold one- to four-family residential real estate loans we originate in our portfolio for investment or to sell such loans to investors, based on profitability and risk management considerations. We sell selected conforming, 15-year and 30-year fixed-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, on a servicing-retained basis, when we are able to, and strategically retain non-eligible fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our one- to four-family residential loan portfolio. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we sold $6.2 million and $12.0 million, respectively, of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans.
 In addition to purchasing consumer loans secured by manufactured housing properties, as discussed above under “Consumer Loans,” we purchase one- to four-family jumbo residential real estate loans to supplement our own origination efforts. During 2021 and 2020, we purchased $14.1 million and $9.9 million, respectively, of one- to four-family jumbo residential real estate loans secured by properties located in the greater Boston market. As of December 31, 2021, the portfolio of purchased residential real estate loans had outstanding principal balances of $26.2 million and were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms. We also purchase participation interests in commercial and multi-family real estate loans in which we are not the lead originating lender. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had outstanding participation interests totaling $21.3 million and $16.0 million, respectively. All loan purchases and participations interests are subject to the same underwriting criteria and loan approvals that apply to loans that we originate for our portfolio. The properties are independently appraised and subject to field inspections by our loan officers.
 Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 
 Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by our board of directors and management. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed information submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain and property valuations. Our board of directors has established a Loan Officers Review Committee to oversee loan approvals. The voting members of the Loan Officers Review Committee consist of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Senior Vice President – Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President – Senior Commercial Loan Officer, Senior Vice President – Senior Retail Loan Officer, Senior Vice President – Bank Administration and Risk Management Officer. 
 The board of directors has granted loan approval authority to certain officers up to prescribed limits, depending on the seniority of the officer, the type of loan and underlying security. Our President and Chief Executive Officer has aggregate approval authority of up to $400,000 per relationship. Individual loan officers generally can approve secured commercial loans of up to $100,000 and residential real estate loans of up to $250,000. Loans in excess of individual officers’ lending limits generally can be approved by a second loan officer who is a voting member of our Loan Officers Review Committee, up to additional prescribed limits of $350,000 for secured commercial loans and $600,000 for residential real estate loans. Loans in excess of such additional limits require approval of the full Loan Officers Review Committee. The Loan Officers Review Committee generally may approve secured commercial loans of up to $1.0 million regardless of existing non-commercial loan exposure. Any relationships in excess of $1.0 million must be approved by the board of directors. 
 From time to time, a loan applicant may not meet one or more of the loan policy or loan program requirements, which would ordinarily result in a denial of the loan application. A loan officer may seek an exception on behalf of the applicant. Any loan made with an exception to policy requires one additional level of approval, except that loans requiring the approval of the Loan Officers Review Committee or the board of directors are exempt from the requirement of additional approval.
 11

Loans-to-One Borrower
 Pursuant to federal law, the aggregate amount of loans that we are permitted to make to any one borrower or a group of related borrowers is generally limited to 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus (25% if the amount in excess of 15% is secured by “readily marketable collateral” or 30% for certain residential development loans). At December 31, 2021, based on the 15% limitation, our loans-to-one-borrower limit was approximately $7.9 million. At December 31, 2021, our largest loan relationship with one borrower was for a $4.8 million participation loan secured by a 204-unit property which was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms.  
 Delinquent Loans and Non-Performing Assets 
 Our collection procedures for residential mortgage loans typically follow Freddie Mac collection guidelines, particularly the guidelines for residential mortgage loans serviced for others. When a residential real estate or consumer loan payment becomes more than 15 days past due, a notice is automatically sent to the customer. Once the letter is sent, we begin contacting the customer either by telephone or additional letters as appropriate.  Alternating telephone attempts and additional letters continue until a loan becomes 90 days past due, at which point we would place the loan on non-accrual status and generally refer the loan for foreclosure proceedings, unless management determines that it is in the best interest of First Seacoast Bank to work further with the borrower to arrange a workout plan. The foreclosure process generally would begin when a loan becomes 120 days delinquent. We do not pursue multiple collections processes, such as considering modifications or workouts, while proceeding with foreclosure.
 When a commercial loan or commercial real estate loan becomes 10 days past due, we contact the customer by mailing a late notice. The loan officer assigned to the account may also contact the borrower. If the loan continues to be past due, the loan officer will continue to contact the borrower to determine the cause of the past due payment(s) and arrange for payments. If a loan payment becomes 30 days past due, it will be reviewed by the Loan Officers Review Committee to develop a plan to bring the past due payment(s) current and determine if the likelihood of repayment is in question. The loan will also be evaluated for a change to the risk rating. If necessary, we will engage an attorney to pursue further collection efforts.

Non-performing Assets. Non-performing assets include loans that are 90 or more days past due or on non-accrual status, including TDRs on non-accrual status, and real estate and other loan collateral acquired through foreclosure and repossession. TDRs include loans for which either a portion of interest or principal has been forgiven or loans modified at interest rates materially less than current market rates. At December 31, 2021, our one TDR was non-accruing. We did not have any TDRs at December 31, 2020.

 Non-performing Loans. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis. Management determines that a loan is impaired or non-performing when it is probable at least a portion of the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent. When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan in the allowance for loan losses is based on present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. Non-accrual loans are loans for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis.
 We generally cease accruing interest on our loans when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. Interest received on non-accrual loans generally is applied against principal or applied to interest on a cash basis. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. 
 Non-performing loans were $837,000, or 0.22% of total loans, at December 31, 2021, compared to $884,000, or 0.24% of total loans, at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, non-performing loans consist primarily of a residential mortgage loan and HELOC to deceased borrowers which had outstanding balances totaling $602,000. The property has an estimated market value of approximately $1.2 million. Additionally, our one non-accruing TDR, a $195,000 non-performing residential mortgage loan was repurchased from Freddie Mac and restructured. At December 31, 2020, non-performing loans consisted primarily of an SBA-guaranteed commercial and industrial loan, which had an outstanding balance of $822,000 and was secured by all business assets and personal real estate holdings of the guarantors.  The SBA guaranteed 75% of this loan balance. Although this loan was performing according to its original terms at December 31, 2020, it was considered non-
 13

performing due to the financial condition and prospects of the borrower. The loan was repaid in full during 2021 with proceeds from the sale of certain personal real estate holdings of the guarantors.
 Troubled Debt Restructurings. Loans are considered TDRs when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties that lead to a restructuring of the loan, and First Seacoast Bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions include a modification of terms, such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or loan balance, a reduction of accrued interest, an extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than current market rate for a new loan with similar risk or some combination thereof to facilitate payment. TDRs are considered impaired loans.
 Loans on non-accrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as a non-accrual TDR. Our policy provides that TDR loans are returned to accrual status after a period of satisfactory and reasonable future payment performance under the terms of the restructuring. Satisfactory payment performance is generally no less than six consecutive months of timely payments.
 As noted above, at December 31, 2021, we had one non-accruing TDR. This delinquent residential mortgage loan was originated during 2010 with Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) insurance and sold to an investor with servicing retained by the Bank. The FHA insurance lapsed and the loan was repurchased from the investor and a modification agreement was executed directly with the borrowers. The modification agreement defers delinquent interest and escrow payments to the end of the loan. The loan was determined to be a TDR as it did not meet the qualifications of Section 4013 of the CARES Act. At December 31, 2021, this loan had a fair value of $195,000 which was determined through a calculation of the present value of estimated future cash flows. The allowance for loan losses includes a specific reserve for this TDR of $-0- as of December 31, 2021. There are no commitments to lend additional funds to these borrowers. 
 Foreclosed Assets. Foreclosed assets consist of property acquired through formal foreclosure, in-substance foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, and are recorded at the lower of recorded investment or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Write-downs from recorded investment to fair value, which are required at the time of foreclosure, are charged to the allowance for loan losses. We order a new appraisal before commencing foreclosure to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan satisfied over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense, in either case during the applicable period of such determination. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property, however, are capitalized to the extent of estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell. At December 31, 2021, we had no foreclosed assets.
 Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management. 
 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses in the loan portfolio. General allowances represent loss allowances, which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 
 In accordance with our loan policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the “watch list” initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing as agreed or if the loan possesses weaknesses although currently performing. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to “special mention,” 
 14

“substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on non-accrual status and classified “substandard.” Management reviews the status of each impaired loan on our watch list on a quarterly basis. 
 On the basis of this review of our assets, our classified assets (including commercial, residential and consumer loans) at the dates indicated were as follows:

Allowance for Loan Losses 
 The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which, in management’s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, potential problem loans and economic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. Because of uncertainties associated with regional economic conditions, collateral values and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is reasonably possible that management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance may change materially in the near-term. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses. Management’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. 
 As an integral part of their examination process, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will periodically review our allowance for loan losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process for establishing the allowance for loan losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.

The Company measures and records its allowance for loan losses based upon an incurred loss model. Under this approach, loan loss is recognized when it is probable that a loss event was incurred. This approach also considers qualitative adjustments to the quantitative baseline determined by the model. The Company considers the impact of current environmental factors at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience was used. Relevant factors include, but are not limited to, concentrations of credit risk (geographic, large borrower and industry), economic trends and conditions, changes in underwriting standards, experience and depth of lending staff, trends in delinquencies and the level of criticized loans. Given the many economic uncertainties regarding COVID-19, the Company made relevant adjustments to its qualitative factors in the measurement of its allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2021 and 2020 that balanced the need to recognize an allowance during this unprecedented economic situation while adhering to an incurred loss recognition and measurement principle which prohibits the recognition of future or lifetime losses.
 Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance are necessary if the quality of any portion of our loan portfolio deteriorates as a result. Furthermore, our regulators, in reviewing our loan portfolio, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. Any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 6 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report beginning on page 63 for a complete discussion of our allowance for loan losses.

Investment Activities 
 The goals of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to help mitigate interest rate and market risk, to diversify our assets and to generate a reasonable rate of return on funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. Our board of directors is responsible for adopting and reviewing annually our investment policy. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) is responsible for implementing our investment policy. Authority to make investments under the approved investment policy guidelines is delegated to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Finance Officer. All investment transactions are reviewed at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors. All of our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale. 
 We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises and municipal governments, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank, time deposits of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds, corporate subordinated debt and investment grade marketable equity securities. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we have no investments in derivative securities. 
 
U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises Obligations. At December 31, 2021, we had government-sponsored enterprise obligations issued by various U.S. Government agencies totaling $6.0 million, which constituted 6.5% of our securities portfolio. The Company invests primarily in Federal Farm Credit Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank bonds.
 
U.S. Government Agency Small Business Administration Pools. At December 31, 2021, we had government-sponsored small business investment company (“SBIC”) pools issued and guaranteed by the SBA totaling $5.0 million, which constituted 5.5% of our securities portfolio. An SBIC is a privately owned and managed investment fund licensed and regulated by the SBA. An SBIC uses its own capital, plus funds borrowed with an SBA guarantee, to make equity and debt investments in qualifying small businesses.
Municipal Bonds. At December 31, 2021, we had municipal bonds totaling $50.6 million, which constituted 55.4% of our securities portfolio, with an average maturity of 18 years and 6 months. These securities often provide slightly higher after-tax yields than U.S. Government and agency securities and residential mortgage-backed securities, but are not as liquid as other investments, so we typically maintain investments in municipal securities, to the extent appropriate, for generating returns in our investment portfolio. We invest primarily in bank- and nonbank-qualified tax-advantaged municipal securities of a satisfactory investment quality rating. 
 U.S. Government-Sponsored Mortgage-Backed Securities. At December 31, 2021, we had government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by the FHLMC, Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA” or “Fannie Mae”) and Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) totaling $26.7 million, which constituted 29.2% of our securities portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass-through” certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. We invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family residential mortgages.
 Corporate Subordinated Debt. At December 31, 2021, we had corporate subordinated debt totaling $3.1 million, which constituted 3.4% of our securities portfolio. These fixed-to-floating subordinated notes were issued by banks located in our market area.
Sources of Funds 
 General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank and repurchase agreements, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments, maturities and calls of available-for-sale securities, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 
 18

Deposits. Our deposits are generated primarily from residents within our primary market area. We offer a selection of deposit accounts, including non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and time deposits, for both individuals and businesses.
 At December 31, 2021, our core deposits, which are deposits other than time deposits, were $334.9 million, representing 85.2% of total deposits. As part of our business strategy, we intend to continue efforts to increase our core deposits while allowing higher-cost time deposits to run off upon maturity. We generally require commercial business borrowers to maintain their primary deposit accounts with us. At December 31, 2021, our deposits totaled $393.2 million.
 Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period that funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit pricing on a monthly basis and continually review our deposit mix. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates, while generally not providing the highest rates in the market. We find it more profitable to concentrate on specific special rate and term accounts, which allows us to add accounts without impacting our overall liability costs for existing accounts. 
 We also rely on customer service, convenience of our branch office locations, advertising and pre-existing relationships to gather and develop deposit relationships. Developing comprehensive banking relationships is a top priority for us and is a focus of our commercial lending team and business development officers. In recent years, we have introduced new business deposit products to appeal to our commercial borrowers. At December 31, 2021, our ratio of commercial deposits to commercial loans (including commercial real estate loans, acquisition, development and land loans and commercial and industrial loans) was 93.46%.
 The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The significant increase in deposit balances during the COVID-19 pandemic may not be long lasting. Our liquidity position is monitored daily and we believe we have a strong contingency liquidity plan should deposit balances fluctuate. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers’ demands. Our ability to gather deposits is impacted by the competitive market in which we operate, which includes numerous financial institutions of varying sizes offering a wide range of products. We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates. 
 The following tables set forth the distribution of total deposit accounts, by account type, at the dates indicated.

 Borrowed Funds. We may obtain advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank upon the security of our capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank and certain of our mortgage loans. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. We use such advances to provide short-term funding as a supplement to our deposits. At December 31, 2021, we had $29.5 million in advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank and $109.7 million of additional borrowing capacity. During November and December 2021, the Bank retired a total of $20.0 million of long-term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank in advance of their scheduled maturities. The interest rates on these borrowings were above current market rates and were scheduled to mature in 2024 and 2025. We were able to retire these borrowings without incurring prepayment penalties. Interest expense, calculated as the present value of the total interest to be paid over the original scheduled maturity period, amounted to $281,000. 
 During 2020, the Bank established a Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston which was secured by pledges of our PPP loans. The interest rate applicable to any advance made under the PPPLF was 35 basis points. As of December 31, 2021, no PPPLF advances were outstanding and all associated collateralized PPP loans were paid or forgiven.
 The Bank has an overnight line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank that may be drawn up to $3.0 million. We may access additional advances if we purchase additional Federal Home Loan Bank capital stock. Additionally, at December 31, 2021, we had $5.0 million of unsecured Fed funds borrowing lines of credit with two correspondent banks. The entire balance of these credit facilities was available as of December 31, 2021.
 Personnel and Human Capital
 We believe that the success of a business is largely due to the quality of its employees, the development of each employee's full potential, and the Company's ability to provide the appropriate recognition and fulfilling rewards. We encourage and support the development of our employees and, whenever possible, strive to fill vacancies from within. As of December 31, 2021, we had 83 total employees and 81 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees. 
 The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique challenge with regard to maintaining employee safety while continuing successful operations. Through teamwork and the adaptability of our management and staff, we were able to transition many of our employees to effectively work from remote locations and ensured a safe working environment for employees performing customer facing activities at our branch locations. All employees are required to stay at home when they experience signs or symptoms of a possible COVID-19 illness and are provided paid time off during such absences. 
 Employee retention helps us operate efficiently and achieve our business objectives. We believe our commitment to prioritizing concern for our employees’ well-being, supporting their career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable fringe benefits contributes to the retention of our top-performing employees. In addition, all eligible employees are stockholders of the Company through participation in our Employee Stock Ownership Plan, which aligns employee and stockholder interests by providing stock ownership on a tax-deferred basis at no investment cost to our employees.

Regulation and Supervision
 General
 As a federal savings bank, First Seacoast Bank is subject to examination, supervision and regulation, primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and, secondarily, by the FDIC as deposits insurer. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which First Seacoast Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including the classification of assets and the establishment of loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. 
 First Seacoast Bank is also regulated to a lesser extent by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the “Federal Reserve Board,” which governs the reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. In addition, First Seacoast Bank is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. First Seacoast Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is also regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a lesser extent, state law, including in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of First Seacoast Bank’s loan documents. 
 As a savings and loan holding company, First Seacoast Bancorp is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. First Seacoast Bancorp is also be subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. 
 Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to First Seacoast Bank and First Seacoast Bancorp. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on First Seacoast Bank and First Seacoast Bancorp. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on First Seacoast Bancorp, First Seacoast Bank and their operations. 
 Federal Banking Regulation 
 Business Activities. A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, First Seacoast Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized, for the first time, the payment of interest on commercial checking accounts. First Seacoast Bank may also establish, subject to specified investment limits, service corporation subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for First Seacoast Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. 
 Examinations and Assessments. First Seacoast Bank is primarily supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. First Seacoast Bank is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. First Seacoast Bank is required to pay assessments to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to fund the agency’s operations. 
 Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including federal savings associations, to meet several minimum regulatory capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio; a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio; a total capital to risk-based assets and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
 The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. The regulations also establish a minimum required leverage ratio of at least 4% of Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised a one-time opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-
 21

sale-securities). First Seacoast Bank did exercise the opt-out election. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, an institution’s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risk deemed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 
 Federal legislation required federal banking agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, to establish for institutions with consolidated total assets of less than $10 billion a "community bank leverage ratio" (“CBLR”). The CBLR is an alternative framework that can be used to calculate a bank’s capital ratio.  Qualifying banking organizations may opt in or opt out quarterly of using the community bank leverage framework which significantly simplifies the calculation of the capital ratio by relying on total average assets and therefore eliminating the need to calculate risk-based assets.  Institutions with consolidated total assets of less than $10 billion and total off-balance sheet exposures of 25% or less of consolidated total assets may opt into the CBLR. The agencies finalized a rule, effective January 1, 2020, that set the CBLR at 9% tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets. Pursuant to 2020 federal legislation, the CBLR was temporarily lowered to 8%, transitioning back to 9% by year-ended 2021. Throughout 2021, the Bank did not make an election to use the CBLR. At December 31, 2021, First Seacoast Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements including the applicable capital conservation buffer. 
 Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by “readily marketable collateral,” which generally includes certain financial instruments (but not real estate). As of December 31, 2021, First Seacoast Bank complied with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. 
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. 
 Prompt Corrective Action. Under the federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital. An institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a leverage ratio of less than 4% is considered to be “undercapitalized.” A savings institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.” A savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.” 
 Generally, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a federal savings association that becomes “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency within 45 days of the date that a federal savings association is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company of a federal savings association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5.0% of the savings association’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the amount necessary to restore the savings association to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency notifies the savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such as restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings associations, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 
 22

At December 31, 2021, First Seacoast Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized,” which means that its total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10%, its Tier 1 risk-based ratio exceeded 8.0%, its common equity Tier 1 ratio exceeded 6.5% and its leverage ratio exceeded 5.0%. 
 Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings association, First Seacoast Bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test. Under the QTL test, First Seacoast Bank must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of every 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association’s business. Alternatively, First Seacoast Bank may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
 A savings association that fails the QTL test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2021, First Seacoast Bank satisfied the QTL test. 
 Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings association’s capital account. A federal savings association must file an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for approval of a capital distribution if: 

• | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings association’s net income for that year to date plus the savings association’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as First Seacoast Bank, must file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend. 
 An application or notice related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if: 
  
• | the federal savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. 
 Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required to assess the federal savings association’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications, such as branches or mergers or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 
 The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. First Seacoast Bank received an “Outstanding” rating in its most recent Community Reinvestment Act federal evaluation. 
 23

Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings association’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as First Seacoast Bank. First Seacoast Bancorp is an affiliate of First Seacoast Bank because of its control of First Seacoast Bank. In general, certain transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets from an affiliate and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. 
 First Seacoast Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders: 
  
• | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of First Seacoast Bank’s capital.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by First Seacoast Bank’s board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 
 Enforcement. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings association. Formal enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1.0 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances. 
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such as First Seacoast Bank. Deposit accounts in First Seacoast Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. 
 The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Assessments for most institutions are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of First Seacoast Bank. First Seacoast Bank cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.

Federal Home Loan Bank System. First Seacoast Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank, First Seacoast Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2021, First Seacoast Bank complied with this requirement. 
 Dodd-Frank Act 
 The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as First Seacoast Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets continue to be examined for compliance by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also weakened the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations and gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws. 
 In addition to creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, directed changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance, mandated the imposition of tougher consolidated capital requirements on holding companies, required the issuance of regulations requiring originators of securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans, imposed regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. 
 Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act involve delayed effective dates and/or require implementing regulations. The implementation of the legislation is an ongoing process. The Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increased regulatory burden and increased compliance, operating and interest expense for First Seacoast Bank.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.

Holding Company Regulation 
 General. First Seacoast Bancorp and First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC are savings and loan holding companies within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, First Seacoast Bancorp and First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC are registered with the Federal Reserve Board and subject to the regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over First Seacoast Bancorp, First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. 
 Permissible Activities. Under present law, the business activities of First Seacoast Bancorp and First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, provided certain conditions are met and financial holding company status is elected, and for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to regulatory approval, and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations. First Seacoast Bancorp and First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC have not elected financial holding company status. 
 Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including First Seacoast Bancorp and First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings association or savings and loan holding company, without prior Federal Reserve Board approval. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. 
 The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: 
  
• | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Capital. Savings and loan holding companies have historically not been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to establish for all bank and savings and loan holding companies, minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. Savings and loan holding companies with less than $3.0 billion in consolidated assets, like First Seacoast Bancorp and First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC, are generally not subject to the minimum consolidated capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve Board.
 Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. By law, all savings and loan holding companies must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions.

Dividends and Stock Repurchases. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall supervisory financial condition. Separate regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with Federal Reserve Bank staff concerning dividends in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a savings and loan holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary savings association becomes undercapitalized. The regulatory guidance also states that a savings and loan holding company should inform Federal Reserve Bank supervisory staff before redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the savings and loan holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of First Seacoast Bancorp to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. For the repurchase plan authorized by the board of directors on September 23, 2020, as described in Item 5 below, a notice was filed with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston did not object to our repurchase plan. 
 Waivers of Dividends by First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC. First Seacoast Bancorp may pay dividends on its common stock to public stockholders. If it does, it is also required to pay dividends to First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC, unless First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC elects to waive the receipt of dividends. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC must receive the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may waive the receipt of any dividends from First Seacoast Bancorp. The Federal Reserve Board has issued an interim final rule providing that it will not object to dividend waivers under certain circumstances, including circumstances where the waiver is not detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the savings association and a majority of the mutual holding company’s members have approved the waiver of dividends by the mutual holding company within the previous twelve months. In addition, for a “non-grandfathered” mutual holding company such as First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC, each officer or director of First Seacoast Bancorp and First Seacoast Bank, and any tax-qualified stock benefit plan or non-tax-qualified stock benefit plan in which such individual participates that holds any shares of stock to which the waiver would apply, must waive the right to receive any such dividend declared. In addition, any dividends waived by First Seacoast Bancorp, MHC must be considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio in the event of a conversion of the mutual holding company to stock form. 
 Acquisition. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition.
