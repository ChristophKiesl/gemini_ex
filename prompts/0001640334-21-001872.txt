ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 20, 2013 under the name UpperSolution.com with the principal business objective of creating an independent and unbiased mobile app that enables consumers to find the best cellular rate plan for their need and getting real-time notifications when a new cellular plan is available.

On January 10, 2018, our company, Analog Nest Technologies, Inc. (“Analog Nest”) and the shareholders of Analog (the “Analog Nest Shareholders”) closed a transaction pursuant a share exchange agreement dated January 10, 2018, whereby our company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Analog Nest (the “Analog Nest Stock”) from the Analog Nest Shareholders. In exchange for the Analog Nest Stock our company issued 100,000 shares of our common stock to the Analog Nest Shareholders.

Analog Nest was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 8, 2017 as a mobile application (“app”) company focused on utility/entertainment apps for Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS platforms. In December 2017, Analog Nest acquired the following apps: Old Fart Booth, Old Fart Booth Pro, Ugly Face Booth, Ugly Santa Booth, Baldy - Bald Photo Booth, Fatty - Make Funny Fat Faces, Slender Man Scary Prank, Anime Booth, Anime Booth Free, Minecart Mayhem, Pimp My Pet, Pimp My Dog, Cavity Detector - Scary Prank, Mustacher, Alex From Target, A Farm Animal Salon, Mustacher Pro, Pimp My Cat, and Animal Dress Up Salon.

On June 26, 2019, a majority of our stockholders and our board of directors approved a change of name of our company to “Startech Labs, Inc.” and a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a ninety-five (95) old for one (1) new basis. The name change and reverse stock split became effective on July 17, 2019.

We have not declared bankruptcy, been involved in receivership or any similar proceeding.

Our office is located at 244 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10016-2817 and our telephone number is (802) 255-4212. We do not own any property and we do not have a corporate website.

Our Current Business

We are in the business of the creation and development of utility/entertainment apps for Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS platforms, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Analog Nest.
Product Lines

Analog Nest operates primarily in the computer/software applications industry and specifically in the development of Android and iOS apps for mobile devices. In the past five years the number of total apps on the Google Play Store has increased from around 200,000 in 2011 to around 1.6 million in 2015 and currently about 2 million apps in the Apple’s App store as well. The Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store are generally referred to herein as an “App Store”.

Analog Nest generates revenue from selling certain apps in the App Stores and from displaying advertisements in certain applications. Approximately eighty percent (80%) of Analog Nest revenue is generated from the sales of Apps and the remaining revenue comes for advertising.

Market Opportunity

With the mobile market still booming, there are billions of mobile devices for which we can offer Apps. Given this large number of available devices, even the smallest App ideas have the potential to generate millions of downloads for its developer.
Competitive Strengths

We believe that the Apps have a solid reputation in the App Stores - some Apps are within the top 1,000 of their categories in the US and also top 10,000 out of all apps on the Google Play Store. We believe that our Apps are for most part unique with solid source codes. Many of the other apps on the market are copycat apps, as opposed to a majority of Analog Nest Apps which are original and unique in their region. We attempt to distinguish the Apps by providing prompt customer services.

Customers and Marketing

Analog Nest has an aggregate of approximately nine million downloads of its Apps from users around the globe, with the US taking the majority of that share.

So far no specific marketing for our Apps has been done. Due to the high ranking and ratings of the Apps, the optimized app store app descriptions, the user’s acquisition is done either directly through play store search or via deep linking from within the other Apps in the portfolio. Having a large portfolio of Apps helps drive more downloads, since each App can serve ads for the other Apps on the portfolio.

With the introduction of Google’s Universal app campaigns a new marketing opportunity has been given to the app vendors to better target audiences through the Google Ad network in an efficient and cost effective way.

Using Google’s Universal app campaigns, the goal is to target 1 million new installs or downloads in the next 12 months. To achieve this number of installs a marketing budget of at least $100,000 USD will be required to generate a lot of installs on a cost per install (CPI) basis.

Competition

The app industry is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry and we expect more companies to enter the sector and a wider range of apps to be introduced. In addition, we have limited experience in developing apps for mobile and other platforms and our ability to succeed on those platforms is uncertain. As we continue to devote resources to developing apps for those platforms, we will face significant competition from established companies and new-comers.
Regulatory Matters

Google and Apple are responsible for regulating their respective app stores. Their stringent rules and guidelines make it so that app developers are mostly shielded from government regulatory bodies as each app goes through a manual approval process before being published on the store. If Google or Apple believe that such app could be in breach of any laws, they simply do not approve it.
Government Regulation

We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding consumer protection, intellectual property, export and national security, that are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States. For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content provided by users.
Employees

Other than our directors and officers, who provide their services to our company and independent consultants, we have no full time employees.

Recent Business Development

We have expanded their suite of travel and metasearch offerings by completing development and the launch of 2 additional sites, www.gohotelbookings.com and www.goflightsnow.com, to complement their existing offerings www.gotravelbookings.com and www.gohotelflights.com.

Along with their existing Android App GoTravelBookings, the registrant hopes to further grow the easily recognizable “Go” Branding to offer both Leisure and Business Travelers a full suite of services, to coincide with the potential resumption of travel in the mid to long term.

NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MAY 31, 2021

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 A summary of significant accounting policies of Startech Labs, Inc. (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements. These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. Basis of Presentation
 The Financial Statements and related disclosures have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Financial Statements have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and presented in US dollars. The fiscal year end is May 31. 

15

Use of Estimates
 The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. Reclassifications
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Revenue Recognition
 Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products and services in accordance with ASC 606,”Revenue Recognition”. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements: 
• | identify the contract with a customer; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | identify the performance obligations in the contract; 
• | determine the transaction price; 
• | allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and
• | recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied. 

 We are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for merger with or acquisition of a target business. Income Taxes
 The Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net income, regardless of when reported for tax purposes. Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
 Net loss per share is calculated in accordance with Codification topic 260, “Earnings Per Share” for the periods presented. Basic net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share has not been presented because there are no dilutive items. Diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive stock options, warrants, and convertible debt are converted or exercised by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are assumed exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Options, warrants and/or convertible debt will have a dilutive effect, during periods of net profit, only when the average market price of the common stock during the period exceeds the exercise or conversion price of the items.

16


For the year ended May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020, respectively, the following convertible notes were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per shares as the result of the computation was anti-dilutive: 
 | May 31, | | May 31, 
--------------------------+----------+------------+---------
 | 2021 | | 2020 
 | (Shares) | | (Shares)
Convertible notes payable | | 47,748,982 | | 29,016,292

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments. As of May 31, 2021, and May 31, 2020, the carrying value of accounts payable and loans that are required to be measured at fair value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments. Discontinued Operations
 The Company follows ASC 205-20,” Discontinued Operations,” to report for disposed or discontinued operations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements
 Management has considered all other recent accounting pronouncements issued since the last audit of our financial statements. The Company’s management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN
 The Company’s financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company does not have significant cash or other current assets, nor does it have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern.

17


Under the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred net losses since inception on April 20, 2013 through May 31, 2021 totaling $38,903,005 and has negative working capital of $188,135 at May 31, 2021. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the Business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. During the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with research and development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital. Historically, it has mostly relied upon funds from the sale of shares of stock and from acquiring loans to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders. In the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through related party proceeds. For the coming year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through related party issuances, debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates enough revenues through the operations as stated above.

NOTE 4 - COMMON STOCK
 The Company has authorized seventy-five million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. On June 26, 2019, a majority of our stockholders and our board of directors approved a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a ninety-five (95) old for one (1) new basis. The reverse stock split became effective on July 17, 2019. The reverse stock split has been retrospectively reflected in the financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2019. On March 9, 2020, the Company issued 55,000,000 shares of restricted common stock valued at $38,500,000 based on stock trading price at $0.70 per share to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer as compensation for the payment of the salary for the year 2019. On June 1, 2020, the Company issued 5,500,000 shares of common stock valued at $5,500,000 based on stock trading price at $1.00 per share for the partial repayment of convertible notes at aggregated principal amount of $11,000. As of May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020, 60,648,433 shares and 55,148,433 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding, respectively.

NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
