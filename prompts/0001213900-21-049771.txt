History of the Company



Wave Sync Corp., formerly known as China Bio-Energy Corp., formerly known as China INSOnline Corp., was initially incorporated on December 23, 1988 under the name Lifequest Medical, Inc. (“DEXT”), a Delaware corporation. On December 6, 2010, the Company entered into an Amendment (the “Amendment”) to a certain share exchange agreement dated November 12, 2010 with Ding Neng Holdings, a British Virgin Islands company (“Ding Neng Holdings”). This share exchange agreement and the Amendment provided for an acquisition transaction in which the Company, through the issuance of shares of its common stock, representing 90% of the issued and outstanding common stock immediately following the closing of this acquisition, acquired 100% of Ding Neng Holdings.



The closing of this acquisition took place on February 10, 2011, on which date, pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement as amended, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Ding Neng Holdings from the shareholders of Ding Neng Holdings. Accordingly, on the closing of the acquisition, the Company, via Ding Neng Holdings, held 100% of Ding Neng Bio-technology Co., Limited, a Hong Kong Company, which held 100% of Zhangzhou Fuhua Biomass Energy Technology Co., Ltd., a wholly-foreign owned enterprise in China (“Fuhua Biomass”), which, via a series of variable interest entity (or VIE) arrangements, controlled the operating company Fujian Zhangzhou Ding Neng Bio-technology Co., Ltd. (“Ding Neng Bio-tech”). In connection of this share exchange, the Company changed its fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31.



The Company and the previous management believed that from late 2011 to 2014, due to change in law, unfavorable market conditions, and lack of effective management, the business of Ding Neng Bio-tech deteriorated significantly and eventually the Company defaulted on various loan obligations. Eventually, Ding Neng Bio-tech completely ceased its operations.



On June 4, 2015, Fuhua Biomass filed a civil action in Haicang District People’s Court of Xiamen, Fujian, PRC against Ding Neng Bio-tech, alleging that the purposes of those certain Consulting Service Agreement, Operating Agreement, Pledge and Security Agreement, Option Agreement, and Voting Rights Proxy Agreement (the “VIE Agreements”) entered into by Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech on October 28, 2010 had been frustrated, and that these VIE Agreements should be terminated. On July 14, 2015, this case was settled via in-court mediation directed by the Court. As a result, Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech entered into binding settlement to, among other things, terminate the VIE Agreements.



Given that the Company was unable to exercise effective control over Ding Neng Bio-tech or gain access to Ding Neng Bio-tech’s financial information since 2011, and that the VIE Agreements were terminated, the Company deconsolidated Ding Neng Bio-tech’s financial results. The Company has written off all investments made in Ding Neng Holdings as loss on investment in subsidiary.



Share Purchase Agreement with EGOOS Mobile Technology Co. Ltd. and Subsequent Developments



On October 19, 2015, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with EGOOS Mobile Technology Company Limited, a British Virgin Islands holding company (“EGOOS BVI”), which owned 100% of EGOOS Mobile Technology Company Limited, a Hong Kong company (“EGOOS HK”), which owned 100% of Move the Purchase Consulting Management (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (“WOFE” or “Yigou”), a foreign investment enterprise organized under the laws of the PRC, and which, through various contractual agreements, had management control and the rights to the profits of Guangzhou Yuzhi Information Technology Co., Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of the PRC as a variable interest entity (“Guangzhou Yuzhi”), which owned 100% of Shenzhen Qianhai Exce-card Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation (“Shenzhen Exce-card”), which owned 100% of Guangzhou Rongsheng Information Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation (“Guangzhou Rongsheng”, together with Guangzhou Yuzhi and Shenzhen Exce-card, is collectively referred to herein as “Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries”), and the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI. Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries engaged in research, development, marketing and distribution of inlays/audio chips for audio bank card products.

The share purchase agreement provided for an acquisition transaction in which the Company, through the issuance of a convertible note to EGOOS BVI’s sole shareholder, acquired 100% of EGOOS BVI.



The closing of the acquisition took place on October 19, 2015. Upon closing, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of EGOOS BVI from the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI.



EGOOS BVI’s organizational structure was crafted to abide by the laws of the PRC and maintain tax benefits as well as internal organizational efficiencies



EGOOS BVI, a British Virgin Islands business company, acted as a holding company and indirectly controled Guangzhou Yuzhi (a variable interest entity in China) and its Subsidiaries. EGOOS BVI’s sole source of income and operations was through its indirect, contractual control of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.



Based in the city of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, Guangzhou Yuzhi and Guangzhou Rongsheng were principally engaged in software and information technology services and shared full-time employees with Shenzhen Exce-card.



We encountered challenges to expand the sales of our audio bank cards. Mobile phone payments through smart phone apps, such as Wechat and Venmo, have become one of the most popular methods to make payments. We ceased our efforts to market and sell our audio bank cards.



We sought to develop relationships with major card issuers in China since 2014 until 2018. We promoted two pilot programs with China Construction Bank (“CCB”), one of China’s four major banks; however, we could not continue the pilot programs due to lack of positive market reaction.



During the year ended December 31, 2019, we ceased all active business operations.



Employees



As of September 20, 2021, we had four (4) full-time employees. There are no collective bargaining contracts covering any of our employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
