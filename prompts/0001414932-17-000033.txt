Item 1. Business
General
Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation (formerly known as Fifth Street Finance Corp. through October 17, 2017), a Delaware corporation, or together with its subsidiaries, where applicable, the Company, which may also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our”, is a specialty finance company dedicated to providing customized, one-stop credit solutions to companies with limited access to public or syndicated capital markets. We were formed as a Delaware corporation in late 2007 and currently operate as a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, we have qualified and elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for tax purposes. See “Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company.” As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or net realized capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders if we meet certain source-of-income, income distribution and asset diversification requirements.
As of October 17, 2017, we are externally managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., which we also refer to as “Oaktree” or our “Investment Adviser,” pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement, dated October 17, 2017, or the New Investment Advisory Agreement, between the Company and Oaktree. Oaktree is a subsidiary of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC, or OCG, a global investment manager specializing in alternative investments. Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC, which we refer to as “Oaktree Administrator” or “OFA”, a subsidiary of our Investment Adviser, also provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate. Prior to October 17, 2017, we were externally managed and advised by Fifth Street Management LLC, which we refer to as our “Former Adviser” or “Fifth Street Management.” For more information about the New Investment Advisory Agreement and Oaktree see “-The Investment Adviser” below.
We seek to generate current income and capital appreciation by providing companies with flexible and innovative financing solutions, including first and second lien loans, unsecured and mezzanine loans and preferred equity. We may also seek to generate capital appreciation and income through secondary investments at discounts to par in either private or syndicated transactions. We invest in companies across a variety of industries that typically possess business models we expect to be resilient in the future with underlying fundamentals that will provide strength in future downturns. We intend to deploy capital across credit and economic cycles with a focus on long-term results, which we believe will enable us to build lasting partnerships with financial sponsors and management teams, and we may seek to opportunistically take advantage of dislocations in the financial markets and other situations that may benefit from our Investment Adviser’s credit and structuring expertise. Sponsors may include financial sponsors, such as an institutional investor or a private equity firm, or a strategic entity seeking to invest in a portfolio company.
 We generally lend to and invest in small and mid-sized companies. Our Former Adviser defined small and mid-sized companies as those with annual EBITDA (generally defined as Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) between $10 million and $120 million. The investments in our portfolio as of September 30, 2017 are principally in the form of first lien, second lien, or, collectively, senior secured, and subordinated debt investments, which may also include an equity component. Our focus prior to entry into the New Investment Advisory Agreement was on originating a prudent mix of senior secured and subordinated loans that our Former Adviser believed would provide superior risk-adjusted returns while maintaining adequate credit protection.
Our Investment Adviser intends to reposition our portfolio into investments that are better aligned with our Investment Adviser's overall approach to credit investing. We expect that our Investment Adviser will focus on middle-market companies, which we define as companies with enterprise values of between $100 and $750 million. Going forward, we expect our portfolio to include a mix of senior secured loans, including asset backed loans, unitranche loans (which are loans that combine the characteristics of both senior and subordinated debt, generally in a first lien position), unsecured and mezzanine loans, bonds, preferred equity and certain equity co-investments as well as certain structured finance and other non-traditional structures. We generally invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as “high yield” and “junk,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal.
From inception through September 30, 2017, we originated approximately $8.0 billion of funded debt and equity investments. Our portfolio totaled $1.5 billion at fair value as of September 30, 2017 and was comprised of 125 portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2017, we held debt investments in 88 of our portfolio companies, one of which was in Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC, or SLF JV I, and equity investments consisting of common stock, preferred stock or other equity interests in 67 of our portfolio companies, one of which was in SLF JV I, 18 of which were in private equity funds and several 
1

of which are in portfolio companies in which we also held a debt investment as of September 30, 2017. At fair value, 92.4% of our portfolio consisted of debt investments and 78.0% of our portfolio consisted of senior secured loans as of September 30, 2017. The weighted average annual yield of our debt investments as of September 30, 2017, including the return on our mezzanine note investment in SLF JV I, was approximately 9.6%, including 8.5% representing cash payments. The weighted average annual yield of our debt investments is determined before the payment of, and therefore does not take into account, our (and our consolidated subsidiaries') expenses and the payment by an investor of any stockholder transaction expenses, and does not represent the return on investment for our stockholders. 
We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a business development company, we are generally only allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowing, provided, that, pursuant to exemptive relief we received from the SEC, we are permitted to exclude the debt of any small business investment company, or SBIC, subsidiaries guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or the SBA, from the definition of senior securities in calculating our 200% asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act. See “-Business Development Company Regulations.” The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing. As of September 30, 2017, we had a debt to equity ratio of 0.78x (i.e., one dollar of equity for each $0.78 of debt outstanding). 
Joint Venture
We and Trinity Universal Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Kemper Corporation, or Kemper, also co-invest through an unconsolidated, Delaware limited liability company, SLF JV I. SLF JV I was formed in May 2014 to invest in middle-market and other corporate debt securities. As of September 30, 2017, we and Kemper had funded approximately $165.5 million to SLF JV I, of which $144.8 million was from us. As of September 30, 2017, we and Kemper had the option to fund additional debt investments in SLF JV I, subject to additional equity funding to SLF JV I from us and Kemper. Additionally, SLF JV I had $400.0 million of borrowing capacity, including a senior revolving credit facility with Deutsche Bank AG, New York Branch, or the Deutsche Bank I facility, with a stated maturity date of July 1, 2019, which permitted up to $200.0 million of borrowings, and a second senior revolving credit facility with Deutsche Bank, AG, New York Branch, or the Deutsche Bank II facility, with a stated maturity date of July 7, 2023, which permitted up to $200.0 million of borrowings. SLF JV I is managed by a four person board of directors, two of whom are selected by us and two of whom are selected by Kemper. SLF JV I is generally capitalized as transactions are completed and all portfolio decisions must be approved by its investment committee consisting of one representative selected by us and one representative selected by Kemper (with approval of each required). As of September 30, 2017, our investment in SLF JV I was approximately $134.2 million at fair value. We do not consolidate SLF JV I in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Organizational Structure
The following diagram shows a simplified organizational structure reflecting our relationship with Oaktree and OFA, our Investment Adviser and administrator, respectively, as of October 17, 2017 and our direct and indirect ownership interest in certain of our subsidiaries as of such date:

Our principal executive office is located at 333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071 and our telephone number is (213) 830-6300.
The Investment Adviser
As of October 17, 2017, we are externally managed and advised by Oaktree, a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. Oaktree, subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory services to us pursuant to the New Investment Advisory Agreement.
Our Investment Adviser was formed in April 1995 and is a premier credit manager and leader among alternative investment managers headquartered in Los Angeles, California. Oaktree has $99.5 billion in assets under management as of September 30, 2017, with approximately 70% in credit strategies. The firm has an extensive global investment platform with more than 900 employees, including over 250 investment professionals who have significant origination, structuring and underwriting expertise. Oaktree’s disciplined investment philosophy and commitment to credit investing and lending have been demonstrated across market cycles for more than 20 years. Oaktree emphasizes an opportunistic, value-oriented and risk-controlled approach to investments in distressed debt, corporate debt (including mezzanine finance, high yield debt and senior loans), control investing, real estate, convertible securities and listed equities. Oaktree manages assets for a wide variety of clients, including many of the most significant investors in the world. As of September 30, 2017, this client base includes 75 of the 100 largest U.S. pension plans, the main pension fund of 38 states in the United States, over 400 corporations, over 350 university, charitable and other endowments and foundations, over 350 non-U.S. institutional investors and 16 sovereign wealth funds. 
Members of our Investment Adviser’s Strategic Credit team have, in the aggregate, over 50 years of investment experience and include professionals who have experience structuring new investments and restructuring existing capital structures in order to maximize recoveries. Our Investment Adviser’s Strategic Credit team is comprised of individuals with a diversity of backgrounds, including, as of the date hereof, former investment bankers, corporate/restructuring lawyers, a doctor, private equity investors, and management consultants. We believe this diversity of experience helps enhance the investment process by bringing different perspectives to credit discussions.

The Transaction and the New Investment Advisory Agreement with Oaktree
On July 13, 2017, Oaktree entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with our Former Adviser and, for certain limited purposes, Fifth Street Asset Management Inc., or FSAM, the indirect, partial owner of our Former Adviser, and Fifth Street Holdings L.P., the direct, partial owner of our Former Adviser. 
In order to ensure that the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, or the Transaction, complied with Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act, our Investment Adviser and our Former Adviser agreed to certain conditions. First, for a period of three years after the closing of the Transaction, at least 75% of the members of our Board of Directors must not be interested persons of Oaktree or our Former Adviser. Second, an “unfair burden” must not be imposed on us as a result of the closing of the Transaction or any express or implied terms, conditions or understandings applicable thereto during the two-year period after the closing of the Transaction. 
On September 7, 2017, we held a special meeting of stockholders, or the Special Meeting. At the Special Meeting, our stockholders approved the New Investment Advisory Agreement to take effect upon the closing of the Transaction. Our stockholders also approved, contingent upon the closing of the Transaction, the election of John B. Frank, Marc H. Gamsin, Craig Jacobson, Richard G. Ruben and Bruce Zimmerman to serve on our Board of Directors, each of whom commenced serving on our Board of Directors on October 17, 2017. In addition, in connection with the Transaction, Edgar Lee became our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer, Mathew Pendo became our Chief Operating Officer, Mel Carlisle became our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and Kimberly Larin became our Chief Compliance Officer.
Upon the closing of the Transaction on October 17, 2017, Oaktree became the investment adviser to each of Oaktree Strategic Income Corporation (formerly known as Fifth Street Senior Floating Rate Corp.), or OCSI, and us, and Oaktree paid gross cash consideration of $320 million to our Former Adviser. The closing of the Transaction resulted in an assignment for purposes of the 1940 Act of the investment advisory agreement between our Former Adviser and us, or the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, and, as a result, its immediate termination. The material terms of the services to be provided under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, other than the fee structure, are substantially the same as the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, except that services are provided by Oaktree.
On October 17, 2017, each of Bernard D. Berman, James Castro-Blanco, Brian S. Dunn, Alexander C. Frank, Byron J. Haney and Douglas F. Ray resigned as a member of our Board of Directors. In addition, on October 17, 2017, each of Mr. Berman, our former Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Steven Noreika, our former Chief Financial Officer, and Ms. Kerry Acocella, our former Secretary and Chief Compliance Officer, resigned from his or her role as an officer of the Company.
Our Former Adviser and Administrator
Prior to October 17, 2017, we were externally managed and advised by our Former Adviser, which was a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, our Former Adviser managed our day-to-day operations and provided us with investment advisory services similar to those now provided by Oaktree as described below under “-New Investment Advisory Agreement.” FSC CT LLC, or our Former Administrator, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Former Adviser. Our Former Administrator provided administrative services necessary for us to operate pursuant to an administrative and loan services agreement, or the Former Administration Agreement. See “- Former Administration Agreement.”
The following diagram shows a simplified organizational structure reflecting our relationship with our Former Adviser and Former Administrator and our direct and indirect ownership interest in certain of our subsidiaries as of September 30, 2017:

Market Opportunity
We believe that the middle market represents a significant opportunity for direct lending for many reasons, including:

• | Large Market. According to the National Center for the Middle Market, as of the second quarter of 2017, there were nearly 200,000 businesses with annual revenues of $50 million to $1 billion or EBITDA of $10 million to $50 million, which businesses represented one-third of private sector U.S. gross domestic product and accounted for nearly 48 million jobs in the United States.


• | Demand From Middle-Market Companies. According to Thomson Reuters Q3’17 Middle Market Lender Outlook, over the past five years, middle-market lending has averaged $170 billion annually, much of which we believe has been used to finance leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, capital expenditures and acquisitions. While the market for middle-market lending has attracted increased capital flows and competition, we believe that the market remains robust and growing and that new market participants may not have the same experience in direct lending and investing across credit cycles as our Investment Adviser. We believe that the market for middle-market lending is relatively less efficient and less well-trafficked, which may provide us with opportunities for incremental returns on our investments relative to the risk of such investments.


• | Reduced Focus From Banks on Middle-Market Lending. We believe that many commercial banks have decreased their lending to middle-market companies in recent years, which has created an opportunity for non-traditional market participants. According to the Standard & Poor’s Leveraged Commentary & Data Leveraged Lending Review - Q2’17, banks account for just 10% of middle-market loans as of September 30, 2017.

Business Strategy
We seek to generate current income and capital appreciation by providing companies with flexible and innovative financing solutions, including first and second lien loans, unsecured and mezzanine loans and preferred equity. We may also seek to generate capital appreciation and income through secondary investments at discounts to par in either private or 
5

syndicated transactions. We intend to invest in companies across a variety of industries that typically possess business models we expect to be resilient in the future with underlying fundamentals that will provide strength in future downturns. We intend to deploy capital across credit and economic cycles with a focus on long-term results, which we believe will enable us to build lasting partnerships with financial sponsors and management teams, and we may seek to opportunistically take advantage of dislocations in the financial markets and other situations that may benefit from our Investment Adviser’s deep credit and structuring expertise. Our Investment Adviser intends to implement the following business strategy to achieve our investment objective:

• | Portfolio Repositioning. Our Investment Adviser intends to reposition our portfolio in the near-term in order to (1) protect principal and minimize credit losses, (2) reduce the portfolio to a smaller number of investments in which our Investment Adviser's team has high convictions, (3) restructure certain loans and exit positions where fair value can be obtained and (4) as investments mature or are refinanced, rotate into investments that are better aligned with our Investment Adviser’s overall approach to credit investing. In the longer-term, our Investment Adviser intends to generate a competitive return on equity and sustainable, consistent dividends through (1) opportunistically investing across the capital structure, (2) seeking to take advantage of dislocations in financing markets and other situations that may benefit from our Investment Adviser’s restructuring expertise and (3) generating capital appreciation and income through secondary investments at discounts to par in either private or syndicated transactions. 


• | Emphasis on Proprietary Deals. Our Investment Adviser is primarily focused on proprietary opportunities as well as partnering with other lenders as appropriate. Dedicated sourcing professionals of our Investment Adviser are in continuous contact with financial sponsors and corporate clients to originate proprietary deals and seek to leverage the networks and relationships of Oaktree’s over 250 investment professionals with management teams and corporations to originate non-sponsored transactions. Since 2005, our Investment Adviser has invested more than $10 billion in over 200 directly originated loans, and the Oaktree platform has the capacity to invest in large deals and to solely underwrite transactions. 


• | Focus On Quality Companies And Extensive Diligence. Our Investment Adviser seeks to maintain a conservative approach to investing with discipline around fundamental credit analysis and downside protection. Our Investment Adviser intends to focus on companies with business models we expect to be resilient in the future, underlying fundamentals that will provide strength in future downturns, significant asset or enterprise value and seasoned management teams, although not all portfolio companies will meet each of these criteria. Our Investment Adviser intends to leverage its deep credit and deal structuring expertise to lend to companies that have unique needs, complex business models or specific business challenges. Our Investment Adviser conducts diligence on underlying collateral value, including cash flows, hard assets or intellectual property, and will typically model exit scenarios as part of the diligence process, including assessing potential “work-out” scenarios. 


• | Disciplined Portfolio Management. Our Investment Adviser monitors our portfolio on an ongoing basis to manage risk and take preemptive action to resolve potential problems where possible. Our Investment Adviser intends to seek to reduce the impact of individual investment risks by limiting positions to no more than 5% of our portfolio.


• | Manage Risk Through Loan Structures. Our Investment Adviser seeks to leverage its experience in identifying structural risks in prospective portfolio companies and developing creative solutions in an effort to enhance downside protection where possible. Our Investment Adviser has the expertise to structure comprehensive, flexible and creative solutions for companies of all sizes across numerous industry sectors. Our Investment Adviser employs a rigorous due diligence process and seeks to include covenant protections designed to ensure that we, as the lender, can negotiate with a portfolio company before a deal reaches impairment. The Oaktree platform has the ability to address a wide range of borrower needs, with capability to invest across the capital structure and to fund large loans, and our Investment Adviser pays close attention to market trends. Our Investment Adviser provides certainty to borrowers by seeking to provide fully underwritten financing commitments and has expertise in both performing credit as well as restructuring and turnaround situations, which we expect will allow us to invest and lend during times of market stress when our competitors may halt investment activity. 

Our Investment Adviser’s emphasis is on fundamental credit analysis, consistency and downside protection, all of which are key tenets of its investment philosophy. We believe this philosophy strongly aligns with the interests of our stockholders. Our Investment Adviser controls primarily for risk, rather than return. Although this may lead us to underperform in bullish markets, we expect that prudence across the economic cycle and limiting losses will allow us to achieve our investment objectives.

Investment Criteria
Our Investment Adviser has identified the following investment criteria and guidelines for identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies. However, not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company in which we invest.

• | Equity Cushion. We generally expect to invest in loans that have covenants that may help to minimize our risk of capital loss and meaningful equity investments in the portfolio company. We intend to target investments that have strong credit protections, including default penalties, information rights and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, such as limitations on debt incurrence, lien protection and prohibitions on dividends. 


• | Sustainable Cash Flow. Our investment philosophy places emphasis on fundamental analysis from an investor’s perspective and has a distinct value orientation. We intend to focus on companies with significant asset or enterprise value in which we can invest at relatively low multiples of normalized operating cash flow. Additionally, we anticipate investing in companies with a demonstrated ability or credible plan to de-lever. Typically, we will not invest in start-up companies, companies having speculative business plans or structures that could impair capital over the long-term although we may target certain earlier stage companies that have yet to reach profitability.


• | Experienced Management Team. We generally will look to invest in portfolio companies with an experienced management team and proper incentive arrangements, including equity compensation, to induce management to succeed and to act in concert with our interests as investors. 


• | Strong Relative Position In Its Market. We intend to target companies with what we believe to be established and leading market positions within their respective markets and well-developed long-term business strategies. 


• | Exit Strategy. We generally intend to invest in companies that we believe will provide us with the opportunity to exit our investments in three to eight years, including through (1) the repayment of the remaining principal outstanding at maturity, (2) the recapitalization of the company resulting in our debt investments being repaid and (3) the sale of the company resulting in the repayment of all of its outstanding debt. 


• | Geography. As a business development company, we will invest at least 70% of our investments in U.S. companies. To the extent we invest in non-U.S. companies, we intend to do so in accordance with 1940 Act limitations and only in jurisdictions with established legal frameworks and a history of respecting creditor rights. 

Investment Process
Our investment process consists of the following five distinct stages.
Source.
Oaktree’s Strategic Credit team has dedicated sourcing professionals and also leverages its strong market presences and relationships across Oaktree’s global platform, which includes more than 250 highly-experienced investment professionals, to gain access to opportunities from advisers, sponsors, banks, management teams, capital raising advisers and other sources. Our Investment Adviser is a trusted partner to financial sponsors and management teams based on its long-term commitment and focus on lending across economic cycles. We believe this will give us access to proprietary deal flow and first looks at investment opportunities and that we are well-positioned for difficult and complex transactions. In 2016, Oaktree’s Strategic Credit team evaluated more than 200 potential direct lending opportunities with total transaction value of approximately $30 billion. More than 85% of these potential direct lending opportunities were for transactions of $50 million or larger, and Oaktree’s Strategic Credit team continues to see a meaningful pipeline of sizeable transactions.
Screen Using Investment Criteria.
We expect to be highly selective in making new investments. The initial screening process will typically include a review of the proposed capital structure of the portfolio company, including level of assets or enterprise value coverage, an assessment by our Investment Adviser of the company’s management team and its equity ownership levels as well as the viability of its long-term business model, and a review of forecasted financial statements and liquidity profile. In addition, our Investment Adviser may assess the prospect of industry or macroeconomic catalysts that may create enhanced value in the investment as well as the potential ability to enforce creditor rights, particularly where collateral is located outside of the United States.
Research.
7

Prior to making any new investment, our Investment Adviser intends to engage in an extensive due diligence process led by investment analysts assigned to each transaction. The analysts will assess a company’s products, services, competitive position in its markets, barriers to entry and operating and financial performance, as well as the growth potential of its markets. In performing this evaluation, the analysts may use financial, descriptive and other due diligence materials provided by the target company, commissioned third party reports and internal sources, including members of the investment team, industry participants and experts with whom our Investment Adviser has relationships. As part of the research process, our Investment Adviser’s analysts typically perform a “what-if” analysis that explores a range of values for each proposed investment and a range of potential credit events.
Evaluate.
Our Investment Adviser assesses each potential investment through a robust, collaborative decision-making process. Our Investment Adviser applies disciplined investment criteria and evaluates potential risk and reward of each investment with significant focus on downside risk. Our Investment Adviser sizes investments at the portfolio level across a variety of characteristics, including based on the investment criteria described above. 
Monitor.
Our Investment Adviser prioritizes managing risk. In managing our portfolio, our Investment Adviser intends to closely monitor each portfolio company and be well-positioned to make hold and exit decisions when credit events occur, our collateral becomes overvalued or opportunities with more attractive risk/reward profiles are identified. Investment analysts will be assigned to each investment to monitor industry developments, review company financial statements, attend company presentations and regularly speak with company management. In circumstances where a particular investment is underperforming, our Investment Adviser intends to employ a variety of strategies to maximize its recovery based on the specific facts and circumstances of the underperforming investment, including actively working with the management to restructure all or a portion of the business, explore the possibility of a sale or merger of all or a portion of the assets, recapitalize or refinance the balance sheet, negotiate deferrals or other concessions from existing creditors and arrange new liquidity or new equity contributions. We believe that our Investment Adviser’s experience with restructurings and our access to our Investment Adviser’s deep knowledge, expertise and contacts in the distressed debt area will help us preserve the value of our investments.
Due Diligence Process
As part of the underwriting process, our Investment Adviser completes a rigorous due diligence process that focuses on four key areas:

• | Company Analysis. Our Investment Adviser actively engages and assesses company management teams. The focus of this analysis also includes identifying and understanding key business and demand drivers. Our Investment Adviser strives to evaluate core risks within businesses and industries and to complete the analysis by thinking like company ownership when evaluating cash flows. 


• | Financial Analysis. Our Investment Adviser analyzes the consistency, stability and reliability of cash flows in addition to evaluating the quality of earnings and conversion of EBITDA to cash. Our Investment Adviser also reviews historical performance through economic cycles, analyzes the potential impact of a downturn in the prospective portfolio company’s end markets and compares the prospective portfolio company’s key metrics to those of its competitors. 


• | Down-side Focus. Our Investment Adviser considers the impact on the prospective portfolio company’s business and cash flows under a number of downside case scenarios and develops an exit strategy in the event of the downside case. There is also a focus on potential risks to business models. Following this analysis, our Investment Adviser considers appropriate risk mitigants, including the structure of the investment and affirmative, negative and financial covenants. 


• | Value. Our Investment Adviser analyzes the risk/reward potential of each new investment relative to other opportunities in the industry and market as well as overall industry valuation trends as compared to the industry risk profile. As part of this analysis, our Investment Adviser considers the cost of capital to competitors as well as alternative investment options. Our Investment Adviser also considers the value of liquidity to our business and operations as well as appropriate illiquidity premiums where we are unlikely to acquire liquid securities.

Investments 
We target debt investments that will generate current income and also provide the opportunity for capital appreciation through our ownership of equity securities in certain of our portfolio companies. We seek to structure our debt investments to provide downside protection through strong credit protections, including default penalties, information rights and affirmative, negative and financial covenants, such as limitations on debt incurrence, lien protection and prohibitions on dividends, although not all of our investments will meet each of the criteria. Our Investment Adviser has expertise in creative, efficient structuring and institutional knowledge of bankruptcy and restructurings, enabling our Investment Adviser to focus on risk control. Our debt investments may be collateralized by a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company. As of September 30, 2017, 78.0% of our portfolio at fair value consisted of debt investments that were secured by first or second priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company.
Debt Investments
We intend to tailor the terms of each investment by negotiating a structure that seeks to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. A substantial source of return is monthly or quarterly cash interest that we collect on our debt investments. We expect that our Investment Adviser will focus on middle-market companies, which we define as companies with enterprise values of between $100 and $750 million. Going forward, we expect our portfolio to include a mix of senior secured loans, including asset backed loans, unitranche loans, unsecured and mezzanine loans, bonds, preferred equity and certain equity co-investments as well as certain structured finance and other non-traditional structures.

• | First Lien Loans. Our first lien loans generally have terms of three to seven years, provide for a variable or fixed interest rate, contain prepayment penalties and are secured by a first priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. Our first lien loans may take many forms, including revolving lines of credit, term loans and acquisition lines of credit. 


• | Unitranche Loans. Our unitranche loans generally have terms of five to seven years and provide for a variable or fixed interest rate, contain prepayment penalties and are generally secured by a first priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. Our unitranche loans may take many forms, including revolving lines of credit, term loans and acquisition lines of credit. 


• | Second Lien Loans. Our second lien loans generally have terms of five to eight years, provide for a variable or fixed interest rate, contain prepayment penalties and are secured by a second priority security interest in all existing and future assets of the borrower. Our second lien loans may include payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal that generally becomes due at maturity. 


• | Mezzanine Loans. Our mezzanine loans generally have maturities of five to ten years. Mezzanine loans may take the form of a second priority lien on the assets of a portfolio company and have interest-only payments in the early years with cash or PIK payments with amortization of principal deferred to the later years. In some cases, we may invest in debt securities that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest for the first few years after our investment. 


• | Unsecured Loans. Our unsecured investments generally have terms of five to ten years and provide for a fixed interest rate. We may make unsecured investments on a stand-alone basis, or in connection with a senior secured loan, a junior secured loan or a “one-stop” financing. Our unsecured investments may include PIK interest and an equity component, such as warrants to purchase common stock in the portfolio company. 


• | Bonds. We may selectively invest in high yield corporate bonds issued by middle-market companies that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. The bonds in which we may invest are expected to have terms of five to eight years and provide for fixed interest rate payments. We do not expect that these bonds would be secured by any assets of the issuer. 

Equity Investments
When we make a debt investment, we may be granted equity in the company in the same class of security as the sponsor receives upon funding. In addition, from time to time we may make non-control, equity co-investments in connection with private equity sponsors. We generally seek to structure our equity investments, such as direct equity co-investments, to provide us with minority rights provisions and event-driven put rights. We also seek to obtain limited registration rights in connection with these investments, which may include “piggyback” registration rights.
9

Private Equity Fund Investments
We have historically made investments in the private equity funds of certain private equity sponsors we partner with in making investments in small and mid-sized companies. In general, we make these investments where we have a long-term relationship and are comfortable with the sponsor’s business model and investment strategy. As of September 30, 2017, we had investments in 18 private equity funds, which represented less than 2% of the fair value of our assets as of such date. Our Investment Adviser does not expect private equity fund investments to be a meaningful portion of our strategy going forward.
SLF JV I
We have invested in SLF JV I, which as of September 30, 2017, consisted of a portfolio of loans to 32 different borrowers in industries similar to the companies in our portfolio. SLF JV I invests in middle-market and other corporate debt securities, including traditional senior debt that are secured by some or all of the company’s assets.
Portfolio Management
Active Involvement in our Portfolio Companies
As a business development company, we are obligated to offer to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies and to provide it if requested. We provide managerial assistance to most of our portfolio companies as a general practice and we seek investments where such assistance is appropriate. We monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company to assess the appropriate course of action for each company and to evaluate overall portfolio quality. We have several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our investments, including the following:

• | Review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies;


• | Periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management to discuss financial position requirements and accomplishments;


• | Attendance at board meetings;


• | Periodic formal update interviews with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the private equity sponsor; and


• | Assessment of business development success, including product development, profitability and the portfolio company’s overall adherence to its business plan.

Valuation of Portfolio Investments
As a business development company, we generally invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity investments of small and mid-sized companies. All of our Level 3 investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. See “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies- Investment Valuation” for a description of our investment valuation processes and procedures. 
Competition
We compete for investments with other business development companies, public and private funds (including hedge funds, mezzanine funds and collateralized loan obligations) and private equity funds (to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and other sources of financing. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we do. We believe we are able to be competitive with these entities primarily on the basis of the experience and contacts of our management team, our responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, the investment terms we offer, and our willingness to make smaller investments.
We believe that some of our competitors make loans with total rates of returns that are comparable to or lower than the returns that we target. Therefore, we do not seek to compete solely on the interest rates that we offer to potential portfolio companies. See “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure - We may face increasing competition for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses."
Employees 
We do not have any employees. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. as our Investment Adviser. See “- New Investment Advisory Agreement.” Our Investment Adviser and its affiliates employ more than 250 investment professionals. In addition, we reimburse our administrator, Oaktree Administrator, for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under an administration agreement or the New Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the costs of compensation of our Chief Financial Officer, 
10

Chief Compliance Officer, their staffs and other non-investment professionals at Oaktree that perform duties for us. See “- New Administrative Services Agreement.”
Properties
We do not own any real estate or other physical properties material to our operations. Our administrative and principal executive offices are located at 333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071. We believe that our office facilities are suitable and adequate for our business as it is presently conducted.
New Investment Advisory Agreement
The following is a description of the New Investment Advisory Agreement, which has been in effect since October 17, 2017. 
Management Services
Oaktree is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors since October 17, 2017, Oaktree has managed our day-to-day operations and provided us with investment advisory services. Under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, Oaktree:

• | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;


• | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make;


• | executes, closes, monitors and services the investments we make;


• | determines what securities and other assets we purchase, retain or sell; and


• | performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies.

The New Investment Advisory Agreement provides that Oaktree’s services are not exclusive to us and Oaktree is generally free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired.
Management Fee
Under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay Oaktree a fee for its services under the investment advisory agreement consisting of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee payable to Oaktree and any incentive fees earned by Oaktree is ultimately borne by our common stockholders. 
Base Management Fee
Under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee on total gross assets, including any investment made with borrowings, but excluding cash and cash equivalents, is 1.50%. 
Incentive Fee
The incentive fee consists of two parts. Under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, the first part of the incentive fee, which is referred to as the incentive fee on income, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based upon our “pre-incentive fee net investment income” for the immediately preceding quarter. The payment of the incentive fee on income is subject to payment of a preferred return to investors each quarter (i.e., a “hurdle rate”), expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the most recently completed quarter, of 1.50%, subject to a “catch up” feature.
For this purpose, “pre-incentive fee net investment income” means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies, other than fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the fiscal quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the New Administration Agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount debt instruments, or OID, with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation.
Under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, the calculation of the incentive fee on income for each quarter is as follows:

11


• | No incentive fee is payable to Oaktree in any quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.50% (the “preferred return”) on net assets.


• | 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the preferred return but is less than or equal to 1.8182% in any fiscal quarter is payable to Oaktree. We refer to this portion of the incentive fee on income as the “catch-up” provision, and it is intended to provide Oaktree with an incentive fee of 17.5% on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income when our pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches 1.8182% on net assets in any fiscal quarter.


• | For any quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 1.8182% on net assets, the subordinated incentive fee on income is equal to 17.5% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, as the preferred return and catch-up will have been achieved.

There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle. 
The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the incentive fee on income under the New Investment Advisory Agreement:
Quarterly Incentive Fee on Income
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(expressed as a percentage of net assets)
Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income allocated to income-related portion of incentive fee
Under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, the second part of the incentive fee will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the investment advisory agreement, as of the termination date) commencing with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 and will equal 17.5% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 through the end of each fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees under the New Investment Advisory Agreement. Any realized capital gains, realized capital losses, unrealized capital appreciation and unrealized capital depreciation with respect to the Company’s portfolio as of the end of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 will be excluded from the calculations of the second part of the incentive fee. 
Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation under the New Investment Advisory Agreement 
Example 1: Incentive Fee on Income for Each Quarter 
Alternative 1 
Assumptions
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2%
Preferred return under the New Investment Advisory Agreement1 = 1.50%
Management fee under the New Investment Advisory Agreement2 = 0.375%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 1.425%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the preferred return under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, therefore there is no incentive fee on income under the New Investment Advisory Agreement.
Alternative 2
Assumptions 
12

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.375%
Preferred return under the New Investment Advisory Agreement1 = 1.50%
Management fee under the New Investment Advisory Agreement2 = 0.375%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 1.80%
Incentive fee = 17.5% × pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to “catch-up”3
= 100% × (1.80% - 1.50%)
= 0.30%
Alternative 3
Assumptions 
Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.5%
Preferred return under the New Investment Advisory Agreement1 = 1.50%
Management fee under the New Investment Advisory Agreement2 = 0.375%
Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(investment income - (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.925%
Incentive fee = 17.5% × pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to “catch-up”3
Incentive fee = 100% × “catch-up” + (17.5% × (pre-incentive fee net investment income - 1.8182%))
Catch-up = 1.8182% - 1.50% = 0.3182%
Incentive fee = (100% × 0.3182%) + (17.5% × (2.925% - 1.8182%))
= 0.3182% + (17.5% × 1.1068%)
= 0.3182% + 0.1937%
= 0.5119%
Example 2: Incentive Fee on Capital Gains under the New Investment Advisory Agreement 
Assumptions

• | Year 1: $10 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $10 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”), $10 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”), $10 million investment made in Company D (“Investment D”) and $10 million investment made in Company E (“Investment E”).


• | Year 2: Investment A sold for $20 million, fair market value (“FMV”) of Investment B determined to be $8 million, FMV of Investment C determined to be $12 million, and FMV of Investments D and E each determined to be $10 million.


• | Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $8 million, FMV of Investment C determined to be $14 million, FMV of Investment D determined to be $14 million and FMV of Investment E determined to be $16 million.


• | Year 4: Investment D sold for $12 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $10 million, FMV of Investment C determined to be $16 million and FMV of Investment E determined to be $14 million.


• | Year 5: Investment C sold for $20 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $14 million and FMV of Investment E determined to be $10 million.


• | Year 6: Investment B sold for $16 million and FMV of Investment E determined to be $8 million.


• | Year 7: Investment E sold for $8 million and FMV.

These assumptions are summarized in the following chart:

 | Investment A | Investment B | Investment C | Investment D | Investment E | Cumulative Unrealized Capital Depreciation | Cumulative Realized Capital Losses | Cumulative Realized Capital Gains
Year 1 | $10 million (cost basis) | $10 million (cost basis) | $10 million (cost basis) | $10 million (cost basis) | $10 million (cost basis) | -- | -- | --

__________ 

1. | Represents 6.0% annualized preferred return.

13


2. | Represents 1.0% annualized management fee.


3. | The “catch-up” provision is intended to provide our Investment Adviser with an incentive fee of 17.5% on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a preferred return did not apply when our net investment income exceeds 1.50% in any calendar quarter and is not applied once our Investment Adviser has received 17.5% of investment income in a quarter. The “catch-up” portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income is the portion that exceeds the 1.50% preferred return but is less than or equal to approximately 1.8182% (that is, 1.50% divided by (1 - 0.175)) in any fiscal quarter.

The Incentive Fee on Capital Gains under the New Investment Advisory Agreement would be:

• | Year 1: None 


• | Year 2: Capital Gains Fee = 17.5% multiplied by ($10 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A less $2 million cumulative capital depreciation) = $1.4 million 


• | Year 3: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5% multiplied by ($10 million cumulative realized capital gains less $2 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $1.4 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $1.4 million less $1.4 million = $0.00 million 


• | Year 4: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5% multiplied by ($12 million cumulative realized capital gains)) less $1.4 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $2.1 million less $1.4 million = $0.7 million 


• | Year 5: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5% multiplied by ($22 million cumulative realized capital gains)) less $2.1 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $3.85 million less $2.1 million = $1.75 million 


• | Year 6: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5% multiplied by ($28 million cumulative realized capital gains less $2 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $3.85 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $4.55 million less $3.85 million = $0.70 million 


• | Year 7: Capital Gains Fee = (17.5% multiplied by ($28 million cumulative realized capital gains less $2 million cumulative realized capital losses)) less $4.55 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee previously paid = $4.55 million less $4.55 million = $0.00 million 

Collection and Disbursement of Fees Owed to Our Former Adviser 
Under the Former Investment Advisory Agreement described below, both the base management fee and incentive fee on income were calculated and paid to our Former Adviser at the end of each quarter. In order to ensure that our Former Adviser receives any compensation earned during the quarter ending December 31, 2017, the initial payment of the base management fee and incentive fee on income under the New Investment Advisory Agreement will cover the entire quarter in which the New Investment Advisory Agreement became effective, and be calculated at a blended rate that will reflect fee rates under the respective investment advisory agreements for the portion of the quarter in which our Former Adviser and Oaktree were serving as investment adviser. This structure will allow Oaktree to pay our Former Adviser in early 2018, the pro rata portion of the fees that were earned by, but not paid to, our Former Adviser for services rendered to us prior to October 17, 2017.
Duration and Termination
Unless earlier terminated as described below, the New Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect until October 17, 2019 and thereafter from year-to-year if approved annually by our Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The New Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The New Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other. The New Investment Advisory Agreement may also be terminated, without penalty, upon the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 
Indemnification
The New Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, Oaktree and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members (or their owners) and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including 
14

reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Oaktree’s services under the New Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment adviser. 
Organization of our Investment Adviser
Our Investment Adviser is a Delaware limited partnership that is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The principal address of our Investment Adviser is 333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071.
Board Approval of the New Investment Advisory Agreement
The then-current members of our Board of Directors met in person with Oaktree to consider the New Investment Advisory Agreement on June 20, 2017 and July 13, 2017. At the in person meeting held on July 13, 2017, such members of the Board of Directors, including all of the then-current independent directors, unanimously approved the New Investment Advisory Agreement. Such independent directors met separately with independent counsel on multiple occasions in connection with their review of the New Investment Advisory Agreement and the Transaction. In reaching its decision to approve the New Investment Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors, including all of the then-current independent directors, reviewed a significant amount of information, which had been furnished by Oaktree at the request of independent counsel, on behalf of the independent directors. In reaching a decision to approve the New Investment Advisory Agreement, the then-current members of our Board of Directors considered, among other things:

• | the nature, extent and quality of services to be performed by Oaktree;


• | the investment performance of us and funds managed by Oaktree;


• | the expected costs of services to be provided and the anticipated profits to be realized by Oaktree and its affiliates from their relationship with us;


• | the possible economies of scale that would be realized due to our growth;


• | whether fee levels reflect such economies of scale for the benefit of investors; and


• | comparisons of services to be rendered to and fees to be paid by us with the services provided by and the fees paid to other investment advisers and the services provided to and the fees paid by other Oaktree clients.

The then-current members of our Board of Directors noted that the terms of the New Investment Advisory Agreement would in comparison to the Former Investment Advisory Agreement:

• | reduce the base management fee to 1.50% of gross assets;


• | decrease the rate of the income incentive fee from 20.0% to 17.5%;


• | decrease the hurdle rate to 6.0% on our income, which could have the effect of making it more likely that Oaktree will earn an incentive fee;


• | decrease the rate of the capital gains incentive fee from 20.0% to 17.5%;


• | eliminate a capital gains incentive fee until the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019; and


• | eliminate the total return hurdle in the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, which could have the effect of making it more likely that Oaktree will earn an incentive fee.

The Board of Directors also considered other investment management services to be provided to us, such as the provision of managerial assistance, monitoring adherence to our investment restrictions and monitoring compliance with various of our policies and procedures and with applicable securities laws and regulations. The then-current members of our Board of Directors discussed Oaktree’s cyber security programs and those of its service providers. Based on the factors above, as well as those discussed below, the then-current members of our Board of Directors concluded that they were satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of the services to be provided to us by Oaktree. 
No single factor was determinative of the decision of the Board of Directors, including all of the then-current independent directors, to approve the New Investment Advisory Agreement and individual directors may have weighed certain factors differently. Throughout the process, the independent directors were advised by independent counsel. Following this process, the then-current members of the Board of Directors, including all of the then-current independent directors, unanimously voted to approve the New Investment Advisory Agreement subject to stockholder approval. Our stockholders approved the New Investment Advisory Agreement at the Special Meeting.

Former Investment Advisory Agreements
The following is a description of the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, which was terminated on October 17, 2017. The Former Investment Advisory Agreement, dated March 20, 2017, was effective January 1, 2017 through its termination on October 17, 2017. The Former Investment Advisory Agreement amended and restated our third amended and restated investment advisory agreement with our Former Adviser, which was effective as of January 1, 2016, to impose a total return hurdle provision and reduce the “preferred return.”
Management Fee
Through October 17, 2017, we paid our Former Adviser a fee for its services under the Former Investment Advisory Agreement consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee paid to our Former Adviser and any incentive fees earned by our Former Adviser were ultimately borne by our common stockholders.
Base Management Fee
As of January 1, 2016, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets, including any borrowings for investment purposes but excluding cash and cash equivalents. The base management fee was payable quarterly in arrears and the fee for any partial month or quarter was appropriately prorated.
Incentive Fee
16

The incentive fee paid to our Former Adviser had two parts. The first part was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding quarter, was compared to a “hurdle rate” of 1.75% per quarter (2% for periods prior to January 1, 2017), subject to a “catch-up” provision measured as of the end of each quarter. Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee was also included in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee. The operation of the incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income for each quarter was as follows:

• | No incentive fee was payable to the Former Adviser in any fiscal quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income did not exceed the preferred return rate of 1.75% (2% for periods prior to January 1, 2017) (the “preferred return”);


• | 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeded the preferred return rate but was less than or equal to 2.1875% (2.5% for periods prior to January 1, 2017) in any fiscal quarter was payable to our Former Adviser. We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the preferred return rate but is less than or equal to 2.1875% (2.5% for periods prior to January 1, 2017)) as the “catch-up.” The “catch-up” provision was intended to provide our Former Adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a preferred return rate did not apply when our pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeded 2.1875% in any quarter (2.5% for periods prior to January 1, 2017); and 


• | For any quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, exceeded 2.1875% on net assets (2.5% for periods prior to January 1, 2017) , the subordinated incentive fee on income was equal to 20% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as the preferred return and catch-up would have been achieved. 

From January 1, 2017 to October 17, 2017, in the event the cumulative subordinated incentive fee on income accrued for the Lookback Period (after giving effect to any reduction(s) pursuant to this paragraph for any prior fiscal quarters of the Lookback Period but not the quarter of calculation) exceeded 20.0% of the cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations during the Lookback Period, then the subordinated incentive fee on income for the quarter was reduced by an amount equal to (1) 25% of the subordinated incentive fee on income calculated for such quarter (prior to giving effect to any reduction pursuant to this paragraph) less (2) any base management fees waived by our Former Adviser for such fiscal quarter. For this purpose, the “cumulative net increase in net assets resulting from operations” was an amount, if positive, equal to the sum of pre-incentive fee net investment income, base management fees, realized gains and losses and unrealized capital appreciation and depreciation of the Company for the Lookback Period. “Lookback Period” meant the period commencing January 1, 2019 and ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the subordinated incentive fee on income was being calculated.
There was no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there was no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters were below the quarterly hurdle and there was no delay of payment if prior quarters were below the quarterly hurdle.
The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee:
Quarterly Incentive Fee on Income
Pre-incentive fee net investment income
(expressed as a percentage of net assets)
Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income allocated to income-related portion of incentive fee
(subject to total return requirement)
The second part of the incentive fee was determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date) and equaled 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain 
17

incentive fees, provided that, the incentive fee determined as of September 30, 2008 was calculated for a period of shorter than twelve calendar months to take into account any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from inception.
Duration and Termination
The Former Investment Advisory Agreement terminated pursuant to its terms on October 17, 2017. 
Indemnification
The Former Investment Advisory Agreement provided indemnification similar to that described above under “-New Investment Advisory Agreement-Indemnification.”
New Administrative Services Agreement
We entered into the New Administration Agreement with Oaktree Administrator on October 17, 2017. Pursuant to the New Administration Agreement, Oaktree Administrator provides administrative services to us necessary for our operations, which include providing office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and such other services as Oaktree Administrator, subject to review by our Board of Directors, shall from time to time deem to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under the New Administration Agreement. Oaktree Administrator may, on behalf of us, conduct relations and negotiate agreements with custodians, trustees, depositories, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and dealers, corporate fiduciaries, insurers, banks and such other persons in any such other capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable. Oaktree Administrator will make reports to our Board of Directors of its performance of obligations under the New Administration Agreement and furnish advice and recommendations with respect to such other aspects of our business and affairs, in each case, as it shall determine to be desirable or as reasonably required by our Board of Directors; provided that Oaktree Administrator shall not provide any investment advice or recommendation.
Oaktree Administrator will also provide portfolio collection functions for interest income, fees and warrants and is responsible for the financial and other records that we are required to maintain, and prepares, prints and disseminates reports to our stockholders and all other materials filed with the SEC. In addition, Oaktree Administrator will assist us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Oaktree Administrator may also offer to provide, on our behalf, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies.
For providing these services, facilities and personnel, we will reimburse Oaktree Administrator the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by Oaktree Administrator in performing its obligations under the New Administration Agreement, including our allocable portion of the rent of the Company’s principal executive offices at market rates and the Company’s allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, their staffs and other non-investment professionals at Oaktree that perform duties for us. Such reimbursement is at cost, with no profit to, or markup by, Oaktree Administrator. 
The New Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their respective duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their respective duties and obligations, Oaktree Administrator and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members (or their owners) and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Oaktree Administrator’s services under the New Administration Agreement or otherwise as our administrator. 
Unless earlier terminated as described below, the New Administration Agreement will remain in effect until October 17, 2019 and thereafter from year-to-year if approved annually by our Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The New Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days’ written notice to the other. The New Administration Agreement may also be terminated, without penalty, upon the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities.
Former Administration Agreement
The Former Administration Agreement was in effect throughout our 2017 fiscal year and terminated by its terms on October 17, 2017. Our Former Administrator was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fifth Street Management. Pursuant to the Former Administration Agreement, our Former Administrator provided services substantially similar to those provided by Oaktree Administrator as described above under “-New Administrative Services Agreement.” For providing these services, 
18

facilities and personnel, we reimbursed the Former Administrator the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Former Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their staffs. Such reimbursement was at cost, with no profit to, or markup by, our Former Administrator. Our allocable portion of our Former Administrator’s costs was determined based upon costs attributable to our operations versus costs attributable to the operations of other entities for which our Former Administrator provided administrative services.
The Former Administration Agreement provided indemnification similar to that described under "- New Administrative Services Agreement."
License Agreement
We were party to a license agreement with an affiliate of our Former Adviser pursuant to which such affiliate granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “Fifth Street” for so long as our Former Adviser or one of its affiliates remained our investment adviser. That license agreement terminated on October 17, 2017.
Material Conflicts of Interest 
Our executive officers and directors, and certain members of our Investment Adviser, serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do or of investment funds managed by our affiliates. For example, Oaktree presently serves as the investment adviser to OCSI, a publicly-traded business development company. OCSI has historically invested in senior secured loans, including first lien, unitranche and second lien debt instruments that pay interest at rates which are determined periodically on the basis of a floating base lending rate, made to private middle-market companies whose debt is rated below investment grade, similar to those we target for investment. Therefore, there may be certain investment opportunities that satisfy the investment criteria for both OCSI and us. OCSI operates as a distinct and separate public company and any investment in our common stock will not be an investment in OCSI. In addition, all of our executive officers and four of our independent directors serve in substantially similar capacities for OCSI. Oaktree and its affiliates also manage and sub-advise private investment funds and accounts, and may manage other such funds and accounts in the future, which have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. For example, the personnel of our Investment Adviser may face conflicts of interest in the allocation of investment opportunities to us and such other funds and accounts.
Oaktree has investment allocation guidelines that govern the allocation of investment opportunities among the investment funds and accounts managed or sub-advised by Oaktree and its affiliates. To the extent an investment opportunity is appropriate for us or OCSI or any other investment fund or account managed or sub-advised by Oaktree or its affiliates, Oaktree will adhere to its investment allocation guidelines in order to determine a fair and equitable allocation. 
We may invest alongside funds and accounts managed or sub-advised by our Investment Adviser and its affiliates in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. For example, we may invest alongside such accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the staff of the SEC permitting us and such other accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that our Investment Adviser, acting on our behalf and on behalf of other clients, negotiates no term other than price or terms related to price. 
In addition, on October 18, 2017, our Investment Adviser received exemptive relief from the SEC to allow certain managed funds and accounts, each of whose investment adviser is Oaktree or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with Oaktree, to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions where doing so is consistent with the applicable registered fund’s or business development company’s investment objective and strategies as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to the conditions of the exemptive relief. Each potential co-investment opportunity that falls under the terms of the exemptive relief and is appropriate for us and any affiliated fund or account, and satisfies the then-current board-established criteria, will be offered to us and such other eligible funds and accounts. If there is a sufficient amount of securities to satisfy all participants, the securities will be allocated among the participants in accordance with their proposed order size and if there is an insufficient amount of securities to satisfy all participants, the securities will be allocated pro rata based on the investment proposed by the applicable investment adviser to such participant, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each, which is reviewed and approved by an independent committee of legal, compliance and accounting professionals at our Investment Adviser. 
19

Although Oaktree will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, we and our common stockholders could be adversely affected to the extent investment opportunities are allocated among us and other investment vehicles managed or sponsored by, or affiliated with, our executive officers, directors and members of our Investment Adviser. We might not participate in each individual opportunity, but will, on an overall basis, be entitled to participate equitably with other entities managed by Oaktree and its affiliates. Oaktree seeks to treat all clients fairly and equitably such that none receive preferential treatment vis-à-vis the others over time, in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duty to each of them; however, in some instances, especially in instances of limited liquidity, the factors may not result in pro rata allocations or may result in situations where certain funds or accounts receive allocations where others do not.
Pursuant to the New Investment Advisory Agreement, our Investment Adviser’s liability is limited and we are required to indemnify our Investment Adviser against certain liabilities. This may lead our Investment Adviser to act in a riskier manner in performing its duties and obligations under the New Investment Advisory Agreement than it would if it were acting for its own account, and creates a potential conflict of interest.
Pursuant to the New Administration Agreement, the Oaktree Administrator furnishes us with the facilities, including our principal executive office, and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. We pay the Oaktree Administrator its allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Oaktree Administrator in performing its obligations under the New Administration Agreement, including, without limitation, a portion of the rent at market rates and compensation of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, their respective staffs and other non-investment professionals at Oaktree that perform duties for us.

Business Development Company Regulations
We have elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of our directors be persons other than “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a business development company unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities.
The 1940 Act defines “a majority of the outstanding voting securities” as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or (ii) more than 50% of our outstanding voting securities.
On October 18, 2017, our Investment Adviser received exemptive relief from the SEC to allow certain managed funds and accounts, each of whose investment adviser is Oaktree or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by or under common control with Oaktree, to participate in negotiated co-investment transactions where doing so is consistent with the applicable registered fund’s or business development company’s investment objective and strategies, as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, and pursuant to the conditions of the exemptive relief.
We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an “underwriter” as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase such securities under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally 
20

cannot acquire more than three percent of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than five percent of the value of our total assets in the securities of one registered investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of registered investment companies. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of these policies is fundamental, and all may be changed without stockholder approval.
Qualifying Assets
Under the 1940 Act, a business development company may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following:
(1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
(a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
(b) is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the business development company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
(c) satisfies any of the following:
(i) does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
(ii) has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;
(iii) is controlled by a business development company or a group of companies including a business development company and the business development company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
(iv) is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million;
(2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control;
(3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements;
(4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company;
(5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities; or
(6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
In addition, a business development company must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
Temporary Investments
Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement (which is substantially similar to a secured loan) 
21

involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would generally not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions.
Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies
Business development companies generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the business development company controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the business development company, through its directors, officers or employees (if any), offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company.
Senior Securities
We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we may be prohibited from making distributions to our stockholders or repurchasing such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — Regulations governing our operation as a business development company and RIC affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth” and “— Because we borrow money, the potential for loss on amounts invested in us will be magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.”
We received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration, or SBA, from the definition of senior securities in the 200% asset coverage ratio we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. This exemptive relief provides us increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow more than we would otherwise be able to under the 1940 Act absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.
Common Stock
We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board of Directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). We may also make rights offerings to our stockholders at prices per share less than the net asset value per share, subject to applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure — Regulations governing our operation as a business development company and RIC affect our ability to raise, and the way in which we raise, additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth.”
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a joint code of ethics with OCSI pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and we have also approved the investment adviser’s code of ethics that was adopted by it under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act. These codes establish procedures for personal investments and restrict certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to the code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code’s requirements. You may read and copy the codes of ethics at the SEC’s Public Reference Room located at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the 
22

codes of ethics are available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and are available at the Investors: Corporate Governance portion of our website at www.oaktreespecialtylending.com.
Compliance Policies and Procedures
We and our Investment Adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation. Our Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for administering these policies and procedures.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to our Investment Adviser. The proxy voting policies and procedures of our investment adviser are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by our Investment Adviser and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change.
Introduction
As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, our Investment Adviser has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, it recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients.
These policies and procedures for voting proxies for the investment advisory clients of our Investment Adviser are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act.
Proxy Voting Policies
Our Investment Adviser will vote proxies relating to our securities in the best interest of our stockholders. It will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted for a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. The proxy voting decisions of our Investment Adviser with respect to any of our investments are made by the investment professionals responsible for monitoring such investment. To ensure that its vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, our Investment Adviser requires that: (a) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to its legal and compliance personnel any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (b) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how our Investment Adviser intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties.
Proxy Voting Records
You may obtain information, without charge, regarding how our Investment Adviser and Former Adviser voted proxies for us for the most recent 12-month period ended June 30, 2017 with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation, Chief Compliance Officer, 333 South Grand Avenue, 28th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071.
Other
We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act.
We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a business development company, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
Securities Exchange Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance
We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. For example:

• | pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;

23


• | pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; and


• | pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit our internal control over financial reporting.

Small Business Investment Company Regulations
Our wholly-owned SBIC subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA. Our SBIC subsidiaries’ licenses allow them to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to customary procedures. As of September 30, 2017, we had no SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, and we had commenced actions to surrender such licenses to the SBA. Our SBIC subsidiaries held approximately $140.0 million, or 8.7%, of our total assets at September 30, 2017.
We have received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act, which allows us increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.
Our SBIC subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA until such time as their respective SBIC license is surrendered to the SBA.
Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Regulations
Each of the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the New York Stock Exchange has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. We are in compliance with such corporate governance regulations applicable to business development companies.
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company
As a business development company, we have elected to be treated, and intend to continue to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute (or are deemed to have distributed) to our stockholders as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To continue to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, dividends of an amount generally equal to at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, or the Annual Distribution Requirement.
If we qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders.
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we timely distribute dividends in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income or capital gain net income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no U.S. federal corporate income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. We generally will endeavor in each taxable year to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to avoid any U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings.
In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:


• | continue to maintain our election to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;


• | derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, or the 90% Income Test; and


• | diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:

24


• | at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and


• | no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or the Diversification Tests.

Earnings considered qualifying income in determining our satisfaction of the 90% Income Test may exclude such income as management fees received in connection with our SBIC subsidiaries or other potential outside managed funds and certain other fees.
We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt instruments that are treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or debt issued with warrants), we generally would be required to include in income each taxable year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the debt instrument, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We also may be required to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of a loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because any OID or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the taxable year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount.
Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted in certain circumstances to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to maintaining our status as a RIC. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous.
RISK FACTORS
