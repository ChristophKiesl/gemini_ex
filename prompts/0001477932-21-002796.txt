Our Company
 
DAVIDsTEA offers a specialty branded selection of high-quality proprietary loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets, tea-related accessories and gifts through its e-commerce platform at www.davidstea.com and the Amazon Marketplace, its wholesale customers which include over 2500 grocery stores and pharmacies, and 18 company-owned stores across Canada. We offer primarily proprietary tea blends that are exclusive to DAVIDsTEA, as well as traditional single-origin teas and herbs. Our passion for and knowledge of tea permeates our culture and is rooted in an excitement to explore the taste, health and lifestyle elements of tea. 
 
We believe that our proprietary loose-leaf tea assortment and related product suite differentiates us from competitors in North America and resonates with our target customer base. Our strategy is to stabilize our business from unfavorable trend lines by playing to our core strengths and strengthening our business by focusing on how to grow our product portfolio. This includes migrating sales to a virtual experience and best-in-class customer service execution. We are focused on effectively optimizing our retail footprint into a more sustainable physical presence that complements a growing online and wholesale business, all supported by a right-sized support organization.
 
On March 17, 2020, we closed all of our stores in North America, as subsequently mandated by the governments in both Canada and the United States in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the degree of uncertainty in connection with the scope and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact to our business, and considering that significant losses were historically incurred in our brick-and-mortar operations which were anchored by commercial leases that are difficult to modify, we concluded that our transformation objectives would be better achieved through a formal restructuring process. 
 
On July 8, 2020, we announced that we were implementing the Restructuring Plan under the CCAA in order to accelerate our transition to an online retailer and wholesaler of high-quality tea and accessories and that during the restructuring process, we would continue to operate our online business through our e-commerce platform at www.davidstea.com and on the Amazon Marketplace, as well as our wholesale distribution channel. Following a careful review of available options to stem the losses from its brick-and-mortar footprint, our management and Board of Directors determined that a formal restructuring process was the best option in the context of an increasingly challenging retail environment, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
On July 8, 2020, we obtained the Initial Order pursuant to the CCAA from the Québec Superior Court in order to implement the Restructuring Plan. Among other things, the Initial Order provided for the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) as Monitor in the CCAA proceedings.
 
On July 9, 2020, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware entered an order in favor of the Company under Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The order of the United States Bankruptcy Court provisionally recognized the proceedings under the CCAA and enforced the Initial Order, in effect providing protection to us from creditor action against its assets in the United States.

As part of its Restructuring Plan and further to obtaining the Initial Order, we, on July 10, 2020, sent notices to terminate leases for 82 of our stores in Canada and all 42 of our stores in the United States. These lease terminations were effective on August 9, 2020.
 
On July 16, 2020, we obtained an Amended and Restated Initial Order from the Québec Superior Court, extending to September 17, 2020 the application of the Initial Order. The Amended and Restated Initial Order also dealt with certain administrative matters, particularly with regards to the lease terminations.
 
On July 30, 2020, we sent notices to terminate leases for an additional 82 stores in Canada. These lease terminations were effective on August 29, 2020. 
 
On August 21, 2020, we re-opened 18 stores across Canada. 
 
On September 17, 2020, the Québec Superior Court extended the stay of all proceedings against us to December 15, 2020 and issued a Claims Process Order establishing the claims procedures for our creditors under the CCAA. This Order, among other things set November 6, 2020 (the “Claims Bar Date”) as the time by which creditors had to submit their claims to PwC.
 
On December 15, 2020, the Québec Superior Court extended the stay of all proceedings against us to March 19, 2021. The Court also approved a retention plan for certain key employees (“KERP”) and created a priority charge over the debtors’ assets for the KERP in addition to extending the Claims Bar Date for certain Canadian employees until December 31, 2020.
 
On March 19, 2021, the Québec Superior Court extended the stay of all proceedings against us to June 4, 2021, and addressed certain administrative matters.
 
Management believes that there is material uncertainty surrounding our ability to execute the strategy necessary to return to profitability in the current environment, including the unpredictability surrounding the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in consumer behavior and the ability to successfully emerge from the Restructuring Plan. As a result, these events and conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exists that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. 
 
Our Market and Competition
 
We participate in a large and growing global tea market which, combined with the relatively low percentage of tea sales in North America, makes the market opportunity very attractive. The markets for tea products in Canada and the United States are highly fragmented and we compete with a large number of relatively small independently owned tea retailers and a number of regional tea retailers, as well as retailers of grocery products, including loose‑leaf teas, tea sachets and tea-related beverages. We also compete with other vendors of loose‑leaf teas, tea sachets and ready‑to‑drink teas, such as club stores, wholesalers and internet suppliers, as well as with houseware retailers and suppliers that offer tea wares and related accessories.
 
We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors because we are considered by our customers as tea experts and by the excellence of our blended and straight teas, through our distinct retail experience, our broad product offering that ranges from loose leaf tea to in-store craft beverages, the potential broad demographic appeal of our brand, innovative tea products driven by customer insights, the effectiveness of our online store, www.davidstea.com, and digital and community focused events, and our passionate customer-focused culture supported by our experienced management team and dedicated board members. 
 
Our Product Offerings

We offer a significant variety of premium loose‑leaf teas and pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts and accessories. We also offer on‑the‑go craft tea beverages in our retail stores.
Teas
 
Our loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts can be enjoyed by consumers at home, on‑the‑go or at work. Our different flavors of loose-leaf tea span eight different tea categories: white, green, oolong, black, pu’erh, mate, rooibos and herbal tea. Our tea collection features over 30% certified organic tea, and to our knowledge makes us the largest organic loose-leaf provider on the market. We carry only responsibly sourced and fairtrade certified blends. Our teas and ingredients used in our tea blends are sourced from various regions around the world, including from China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Kenya, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Thailand. In addition to loose‑leaf teas, we sell pre‑packaged teas and tea sachets to make the tea experience more convenient. Our tea-related gifts include special edition seasonal and holiday gift packages as well as novelty themed gifts that continue to innovate with new themes, seasonal collections and visually-appealing gift boxes designed for entertaining. Our tea gifts are substantially all either fully recyclable or compostable.

Tea Accessories
 
Our tea accessories are created to make the tea preparation process and tea experience more convenient, fun and easy at home or on-the-go. Tea accessories include tea mugs, travel mugs, teacup sets, teapots, tea makers, kettles, infusers, filters, frothers, tins and spoons. Many of our accessories are crafted with unique functional features to improve tea preparation and consumption as well as with visually-appealing colors and designs consistent with our brand aesthetic. 
Distribution Channels
 
We have strategically pivoted the organization to serve consumer demand by leveraging our digital channels supported by emerging omni-channel fulfillment capabilities, including buy online pick-up in store and curbside pick-up. These strategies align with rapidly evolving consumer preferences as we refocus our energies to provide consumers with an enhanced shopping experience on our online channels. We believe our continued efforts to transform our business to a digital first organization will improve our customer experience, our overall performance, and ultimately position us for long-term growth.
Digital Retail
     Our online store, www.davidstea.com, features our full assortment of premium loose‑leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts and accessories. To drive increased sales through our website, we utilize online‑specific marketing and promotions in addition to employing banner advertisements, search engine optimization and pay‑per‑click arrangements on various social media platforms to help drive customer traffic to our website. The use of influencers and affiliates with like-mined brands are also helping to attract customers to our online store. We periodically enhance our online store with new features and functionality to improve our customers’ experience and accessibility for mobile users. We have also launched a select assortment on the Amazon Marketplace that complements our full product assortment on our online store. 
Wholesale 
    We sell our tea and related products to premium grocery and drugstore chains throughout Canada. We believe that the broad distribution of select tea blends helps to service not only existing customers but also attract new customers to our exclusive sachet tea offerings, while ultimately also driving greater brand awareness and traffic to our online and retail stores where our full selection of products including loose-leaf tea blends and packaged gifts become available. In Fiscal 2020, demand from hotels, restaurants and various other office and corporate customers was softened by the impact of COVID-19. 
Retail Stores and Operations
    Over the last decade, our brand connected with consumers and created a reputation of quality and innovation driven primarily from our in-store experience. The secular decline in retail and consumers’ move to everything digital has significantly impacted our business. We continue our transition to a digital first organization, complemented by select stores strategically located throughout Canada and we continue to re-invent our in-store experience. 
 
We began the year with over 230 stores in North America and as of January 30, 2021, our retail footprint consisted of 18 mall-based stores in Canada. Each store exterior prominently displays the DAVIDsTEA teal signage and our in-store Tea Guides’ passion for tea and wellness permeate our culture. A key element of the retail experience is our “Tea Wall,” a focal point of the store. Our Tea Guides help to create a highly interactive and immersive multi-sensory experience for our customers. The Tea Guides facilitate customers’ interaction with our products through education and sampling, which allows our customers the opportunity to appreciate the compelling attributes of tea as well as the ease of preparation.

Marketing and Advertising
     We use a variety of marketing and advertising mediums to drive brand health, customer acquisition, and engagement. We leverage our customer database and respond to shopping behaviors and needs with content across email, site, and digital media to drive relevance and urgency. Our diversified media mix spans traditional to digital to social media. We focus on productivity of marketing investment to drive increased effectiveness.
 
We are focused on amplifying all marketing and advertising efforts to help build brand awareness and increase sales on our digital platforms. Such marketing efforts include communications with our Super Steeper and Frequent Steeper loyalty members and using paid and non-paid media programs to help create demand on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, YouTube, Snapchat, Tik-Tok and Yelp. 
 
COVID-19 has impacted our in-store marketing efforts as we address the social distancing and other regulatory requirements and protocols. Notwithstanding this, we differentiate our business through a field‑based marketing approach to build brand awareness and drive customers to our stores and website in both new and existing markets. 
 
Product Development and Design
     Our tea and merchandising teams seek premium teas and tea-related products from around the world. These teams consist of Tea Blend Developers, Product Designers, Category Merchants and Quality Control Personnel, who leverage our extensive experience in selecting and developing our product assortment. We constantly explore distinctive ingredients, flavors and trends that are popular in a variety of cultures, which we introduce to our customers through their incorporation in new teas. Our research and development team works with our blenders and suppliers to create new and exciting flavors of tea, which we rotate into our product offerings to attract new customers and to continue to pique the interest of existing customers. Our blending process focuses on magnifying the senses and bringing smell and taste to the forefront. We introduce new flavors and blends each month as well as seasonal holidays blends. Through extensive research, we have identified key customer segments and preferences to help evaluate our product assortment and we have developed an effective product release cadence. We believe our focus on innovation and continual product development are key differentiating factors for our brand that drives our customers’ loyalty and supports our efforts to attract new customers.
 
Travel restrictions brought on by COVID-19 have not impacted our ability to develop new products and innovate, due primarily to strong relationships built over the years with our suppliers, including our significant library of untapped new blends and products that we can bring to market as required.
 
Our innovation also extends to creating new and exciting merchandise to make the tea consumption and experience more convenient and stimulating at home or on-the-go. Since our merchandising team designs and develops most of our products in‑house, we are better positioned than our competitors who do not have such an in-house function to create the unique and proprietary designs that make consuming loose‑leaf tea easier and more enjoyable for our customers. We believe the combination of our product selection and our product innovation allows us to offer customers a distinctive assortment that differentiates us from other specialty tea retailers.
 
Sourcing and Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate any tea estates or blending operations; instead, we work with vendors who source ingredients for our teas and tea blends from all over the world. The majority of our tea blenders are in either Germany or the United States. Since we founded the Company in 2008, we have developed strong relationships with our vendors. These relationships are important, as we depend on our vendors to provide us with the highest quality teas and ingredients from around the world. Our quality control process includes both in-house testing and vendor testing. Therefore, in addition to bringing our designs for tea blends to fruition, our vendors play an important role in quality control and in ensuring our teas meet applicable regulatory guidelines. Our tea merchandise is sourced from a number of suppliers who manufacture to our unique and proprietary designs.
Warehouse and Distribution Facilities
 
We distribute our loose-leaf teas, pre-packaged teas, tea sachets and tea-related gifts, accessories to our stores and our online customers from distribution centers in Sherbrooke, Québec and Champlain, New York using third-party logistics facilities in these locations. The Sherbrooke, Québec facility ships to all our Canadian customers. The Champlain, New York facility ships to all our U.S. customers. Our products are typically shipped to our customers via third‑party national transportation providers multiple times per week.

We also assemble finished goods from our production facility located in Montreal, Québec. COVID-19 has heighted the importance of our health and safety protocols on our production, warehouse and distribution facilities. Social distancing and other health and safety requirements, including cleanliness protocols, have put constraints on our production capacity, which we have addressed through additional operating shifts and automating manual processes where possible. 
 
Management Information Systems
 
Our management information systems provide a full range of business process supports to our online and retail stores, our store operations and service support center teams. Additionally, we operate our website on an independent platform. We utilize a combination of industry‑standard and customized software systems to provide various functions related to point of sales, inventory management, warehouse management, and accounting and financial reporting.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to labor and employment laws, import and trade restrictions laws, laws governing advertising, privacy and data security laws, safety regulations, and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that apply to retailers and/or the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. In the United States, we are subject to the regulatory authority of, among other agencies, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We are also subject to the laws of Canada, including the regulatory authority of Canadian Food Inspection Agency, as well as provincial and local regulations. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.
Insurance
 
We maintain third-party insurance for a number of risk management activities including, but not limited to, workers’ compensation, general liability, property, directors and officers, cyber insurance and employee-related health care benefits. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to ensure that we maintain adequate levels of coverage. 
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 
     We regard intellectual property and other proprietary rights as important to our success. In addition to registered intellectual property, such as our patents and marks, we also rely upon trade secrets and know‑how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including by availing ourselves of trademark and trade secret laws and by entering into confidentiality agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information.
 
We own several trademarks and servicemarks that have been registered with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including DAVIDsTEA®. We have also registered our stylized logos, and we own domain names, including www.davidstea.com. In addition, we have registered or have applied to register one or more of our marks in a number of foreign countries and expect to continue to do so in the future. However, we cannot be certain that we can obtain the registration for the marks in every country where we apply for registration.
 
We must constantly protect against any infringement by competitors. If we believe a competitor has infringed or is infringing upon our rights, we may take legal action, which could result in litigation, in which case we may incur significant expenses and divert significant attention from our business operations.
 
Human Capital
 
As of January 30, 2021, we employed a total of 252 full‑time employees and 182 part‑time employees in Canada. Of all those employees, 137 were employed in our corporate office, 112 in our production and distribution operations and 185 were employed in our store network. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. 

10

Seasonality
 
Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations, reflecting increased sales during the holiday season in November and December. Our sales and income are generally highest in the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday sales period, and tends to be lowest in the second and third fiscal quarters. Therefore, operating results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. To prepare for the holiday season, we must increase our inventory levels above those maintained during the rest of the year. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, to reach their highest levels in the third and fourth quarters in anticipation of the increased net sales during the holiday season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variations in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales, earnings/(losses) and working capital requirements during the year.
