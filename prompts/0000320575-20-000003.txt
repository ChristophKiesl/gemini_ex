Recent Developments
Reorganization, Chapter 11 Proceedings, and Going Concern
On March 1, 2020 (the “Petition Date”), Pioneer Energy Services Corp. (“Pioneer”) and its affiliates Pioneer Coiled Tubing Services, LLC, Pioneer Drilling Services, Ltd., Pioneer Fishing & Rental Services, LLC, Pioneer Global Holdings, Inc., Pioneer Production Services, Inc., Pioneer Services Holdings, LLC, Pioneer Well Services, LLC, Pioneer Wireline Services Holdings, Inc., Pioneer Wireline Services, LLC (collectively with Pioneer, the “Pioneer RSA Parties”) filed voluntary petitions (the “Bankruptcy Petitions”) for reorganization under title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Chapter 11 proceedings are being jointly administered under the caption In re Pioneer Energy Services Corp. et al (the “Chapter 11 Cases”).
Since the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the Pioneer RSA Parties have continued to operate our business as a “debtor-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Petitions constitute an event of default that accelerated our obligations under the following debt instruments (the “Debt Instruments”):

• | Term Loan Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2017, by and among Pioneer, as the borrower, the lenders party thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as administrative agent (the “Term Loan”);


• | Credit Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2017, by and among Pioneer, as the parent and a borrower, the other borrowers party thereto, Wells Fargo, National Association, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the other lenders party thereto (the “Prepetition ABL Facility”); and


• | 6.125% Senior Notes due 2022 issued by Pioneer pursuant to the Indenture, dated March 18, 2014, by and among Pioneer, as the issuer, the guarantors party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “Senior Notes”).

Under the Bankruptcy Code, holders of our Senior Notes and the lenders under our Term Loan and the Prepetition ABL Facility are stayed from taking any action against us as a result of this event of default.
In connection with the Bankruptcy Petitions, the Pioneer RSA Parties entered into a restructuring support agreement (the “RSA”) with holders of approximately 99% in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Term Loan (the “Consenting Term Lenders”) and holders of approximately 75% in aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes (the “Consenting Noteholders” and together with the Consenting Term Lenders, the “Consenting Creditors”). The RSA incorporates economic terms regarding a restructuring of the Pioneer RSA Parties agreed to by the parties reflected in a term sheet attached as Exhibit B to the RSA. Pursuant to the RSA, the Consenting Creditors and the Pioneer RSA Parties made certain customary commitments to each other, including the Consenting Noteholders committing to vote for, and the Consenting Creditors committing to support, the restructuring transactions (the “Restructuring”) to be effectuated through a plan of reorganization that incorporates the economic terms included in the RSA (the “Plan”). The Pioneer RSA Parties filed the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court on March 2, 2020.
Debtor-in-Possession Financing and New Revolver
On February 28, 2020, we received commitments pursuant to a commitment letter (“the Commitment Letter”) from PNC Bank, N.A. for a $75 million asset-based revolving loan debtor-in-possession financing facility (the “DIP Facility”) and a $75 million asset-based revolving exit financing facility (the “New Revolver”). On March 3, 2020, with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, we entered into the DIP Facility and used the proceeds of the initial extensions of credit thereunder to refinance all outstanding letters of credit under the Prepetition ABL Facility in connection with the termination of the Prepetition ABL Facility and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and transactional and professional fees related thereto.
The DIP Facility has a 5-month maturity, bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points per annum, and contains customary covenants and events of default. The borrowers and guarantors under the DIP Facility are the same as the borrowers and guarantors under the Prepetition ABL Facility. Subject to certain exceptions, our obligations under the DIP Facility are superpriority administrative expenses in the Chapter 11 Cases and are secured by a first-priority lien on inventory and cash and a second-priority lien on all other assets of the borrowers and guarantors thereunder.
3

The Commitment Letter contemplates that upon our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, the DIP Facility will “roll” into the New Revolver. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, the New Revolver will have a 5-year maturity, will bear interest at a rate per annum between LIBOR plus 175 basis points and LIBOR plus 225 basis points (depending on the average excess availability under the New Revolver), and will contain customary covenants and events of default. Subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, the obligations of the borrowers and guarantors under the New Revolver will be secured by a first-priority lien on inventory and cash and a second-priority lien on substantially all other assets of the borrowers and guarantors thereunder. We anticipate that the proceeds of the New Revolver will be used to repay in full all amounts outstanding under the DIP Facility and for general corporate purposes.
Going Concern and Financial Reporting in Reorganization
The risks and uncertainties surrounding the Chapter 11 Cases, the defaults under our Debt Instruments, and the weak industry conditions impacting our business raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the audit report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern. For additional information concerning our bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 11, see Note 2, Going Concern and Subsequent Events, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and Item 1A – “Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Delisting of our Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”)
Our common stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “PES” until August 15, 2019, at which time it was removed from trading on the NYSE due to our inability to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the NYSE. Our common stock subsequently traded on the OTC Markets under the symbol “PESX” until March 3, 2020, at which time, due to our voluntary filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, our common stock commenced trading on the OTC Pink marketplace under the trading symbol “PESXQ”.
Company Overview
Pioneer Energy Services Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas in 1979 as the successor to a business that had been operating since 1968. Since then, we have significantly expanded and transformed our business through acquisitions and organic growth.
Pioneer Energy Services Corp. provides land-based drilling services and production services to a diverse group of oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States and internationally in Colombia. Drilling services and production services are fundamental to establishing and maintaining the flow of oil and natural gas throughout the productive life of a well.
Our Segments and Services
Our business is comprised of two business lines — Drilling Services and Production Services. We report our Drilling Services business as two reportable segments: (i) Domestic Drilling and (ii) International Drilling. We report our Production Services business as three reportable segments: (i) Well Servicing, (ii) Wireline Services, and (iii) Coiled Tubing Services. Financial information about our operating segments is included in Note 12, Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Drilling Services 
We provide a comprehensive service offering which includes the drilling rig, crews, supplies, and most of the ancillary equipment needed to operate our drilling rigs. Our current drilling rig fleet is 100% pad-capable and offers the latest advancements in pad drilling. The following table summarizes our current rig fleet composition by segment and region:
4


 | Multi-well, Pad-capable
 | SCR rigs | AC rigs | | Total
Domestic drilling | | | | 
Marcellus/Utica | — | | 5 | | 5 
Permian Basin and Eagle Ford | — | | 10 | | 10
Bakken | — | | 2 | | 2 
International drilling | 8 | | — | | 8 
 | | | | 25 

Technological advancements and trends in our industry affect the demand for certain types of equipment and there are numerous factors that differentiate land drilling rigs, such as the type of power used, drilling depth capabilities or hook load capacity, mud pump pressure rating, and the ability to drill multiple well bores from a single surface location or pad. 
Every drilling rig in our fleet is electric, either AC or SCR powered. Electric rigs are considered safer, more reliable and more efficient than mechanically powered rigs, while AC rigs are considered to be more energy efficient and provide more precise control of equipment than their SCR counterparts, further enhancing rig safety and reducing drilling time. All but one of our rigs has 750,000 pounds or greater of hook load capacity, and every drilling rig is equipped with a top drive, an iron roughneck, an automatic catwalk, and a walking or skidding system. This equipment provides our clients with drilling rigs that have more varied capabilities for drilling in unconventional plays and improves our efficiency and safety, as described in more detail below. 
Top drives can be used in horizontal well drilling to reach formations that may not be accessible with conventional rotary drilling because they provide maximum torque and rotational control which increases the degree of control afforded the operator, and reduces the difficulties encountered while drilling horizontal wells. An iron roughneck is a remotely operated pipe-handling feature on the rig floor, which is used to help reduce the occurrence of repetitive motion injuries and decrease drill pipe tripping time. An automated catwalk is a drill pipe-handling feature used to raise drill pipe, drill collars, casing, and other necessary items to the drilling rig floor. Its function has significant safety advantages and can reduce the overall time required to complete the well.
Oil and gas exploration and production companies typically prefer to use “pad drilling” which allows a series of horizontal wells to be drilled in succession by walking or skidding a drilling rig at a single pad-site location. Walking systems increase efficiency by allowing multiple wells to be drilled on the same pad site and permitting the drilling rig to move between wells while drill pipe remains in the derrick and ancillary systems such as engines and mud tanks remain stationary, thus reducing move times and costs. Our omnidirectional walking systems enable the drilling rig to move forward, backward, and side to side which affords the operator additional flexibility. 
We believe that our drilling rigs and other related equipment are in good operating condition. Our employees perform periodic maintenance and minor repair work on our drilling rigs. We rely on various oilfield service companies for major repair work and overhaul of our drilling equipment when needed. We also engage in periodic improvement and upgrades of our drilling equipment. In the event of major breakdowns or mechanical problems, our rigs could be subject to significant idle time and a resulting loss of revenue if the necessary repair services are not immediately available.
Daywork contracts are comprehensive agreements under which we provide a comprehensive service offering, including the drilling rig, crew, supplies, and most of the ancillary equipment necessary to operate the rig. Generally, our land drilling rigs operate with crews of five to six persons. We obtain our contracts for drilling oil and natural gas wells either through competitive bidding or through direct negotiations with existing or potential clients. Contract terms generally depend on the complexity and risk of operations, the on-site drilling conditions, the type of equipment used, and the anticipated duration of the work to be performed. Spot market contracts generally provide for the drilling of a single well and typically permit the client to terminate on short notice. Drilling contracts for individual wells are usually completed in less than 30 days, but we typically enter into longer-term drilling contracts for our newly constructed rigs and/or during periods of higher rig demand.

Production Services 
Our production services business segments provide well, wireline and coiled tubing services to producers primarily in Texas and the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions, as well as in North Dakota, Louisiana and Mississippi. 
Newly drilled wells require completion services to prepare the well for production. The completion process may involve selectively perforating the well casing in the productive zones to allow oil or gas to flow into the well bore, stimulating and testing these zones and installing the production string and other downhole equipment. The completion process typically requires a few days to several weeks, depending on the nature and type of the completion, and generally requires additional auxiliary equipment. Accordingly, completion services require less well-to-well mobilization of equipment and can provide higher operating margins than regular maintenance work. The demand for completion services is directly related to drilling activity levels, which are sensitive to changes in oil and gas prices.
Regular maintenance is required throughout the life of a well to sustain optimal levels of oil and gas production. Common maintenance services include repairing inoperable pumping equipment in an oil well, replacing defective tubing in a gas well, cleaning a live well, and servicing mechanical issues. Our maintenance services involve relatively low-cost, short-duration jobs which are part of normal well operating costs. The need for maintenance does not directly depend on the level of drilling activity, although it is somewhat impacted by short-term fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Accordingly, maintenance services generally experience relatively stable demand; however, when oil or gas prices are too low to justify additional expenditures, operating companies may choose to temporarily shut in producing wells rather than incur additional maintenance costs.
In addition to periodic maintenance, producing oil and gas wells occasionally require major repairs or modifications called workovers, which are typically more complex and more time consuming than maintenance operations. Workover services include extensions of existing wells to drain new formations either through perforating the well casing to expose additional productive zones not previously produced, deepening well bores to new zones, or drilling lateral well bores to improve reservoir drainage patterns. Workovers also include major subsurface repairs such as repair or replacement of well casing, recovery or replacement of tubing and removal of foreign objects from the well bore. A workover may require a few days to several weeks and generally requires additional auxiliary equipment. The demand for workover services is sensitive to oil and gas producers’ intermediate and long-term expectations for oil and gas prices.
At the end of the well life cycle, a process is required to permanently close oil and gas wells that are no longer capable of producing in economic quantities. Many well operators bid this work on a “turnkey” basis, requiring the service company to perform the entire job, including the sale or disposal of equipment salvaged from the well as part of the compensation received, and complying with state regulatory requirements. Plugging and abandonment work can provide favorable operating margins and is less sensitive to oil and gas pricing than drilling and workover activity since well operators must plug a well in accordance with state regulations when it is no longer productive. 
As of December 31, 2019, the fleet counts for each of our production services business segments are as follows:

 | 550 HP | | 600 HP | Total
Well servicing rigs, by horsepower (HP) rating | 112 | | 12 | 124 
 | | | | Total
Wireline services units | | 93
Coiled tubing services units | | 9 


• | Well Servicing. Our well servicing rig fleet provides a range of services, including the completion of newly-drilled wells, maintenance and workover of existing wells, and plugging and abandonment of wells at the end of their useful lives.

Well servicing rigs are frequently used to complete newly drilled wells to minimize the use of higher cost drilling rigs in the completion process. Our well servicing rigs are also used to convert former producing wells to injection wells through which water or carbon dioxide is then pumped into the formation for enhanced oil recovery operations. Extensive workover operations are normally performed by a well servicing rig with additional specialized auxiliary equipment, which may include rotary drilling equipment, mud pumps, mud tanks and fishing tools, depending upon the particular type of workover operation. All of our well servicing rigs are designed to perform complex workover operations. We 
6

also perform plugging and abandonment work throughout our core areas of operation in conjunction with equipment provided by other service companies.
We believe that our well servicing fleet is among the newest in the industry, consisting entirely of tall-masted rigs with at least 550 horsepower, capable of working at depths of over 20,000 feet. These specifications allow us to operate in areas with deeper well depths and perform jobs that rigs with lesser capabilities cannot. Our fleet consists of 112 rigs with 550 horsepower and 12 rigs with 600 horsepower which are deployed through 9 operating locations concentrated in Texas, as well as in North Dakota, Colorado and Mississippi.

• | Wireline Services. Wireline trucks, like well servicing rigs, are utilized throughout the life of a well. Wireline trucks are often used in place of a well servicing rig when there is no requirement to remove tubulars from the well in order to make repairs. Wireline services typically utilize a single truck equipped with a spool of wireline that is used to lower and raise a variety of specialized tools in and out of the wellbore.

Electric wireline contains a conduit that allows signals to be transmitted to or from tools located in the well. These tools can be used to measure pressures and temperatures as well as the condition of the casing and the cement that holds the casing in place. In order for oil and gas exploration and production companies to better understand the reservoirs they are drilling or producing, they require logging services to accurately characterize reservoir rocks and fluids. We provide both open- and cased-hole logging services. Other applications for wireline tools include placing equipment in or retrieving equipment (or debris) from the wellbore, installing bridge plugs, perforating the casing in order to prepare the well for production, or cutting off pipe that is stuck in the well so that the free section can be recovered. 
Our fleet of 93 wireline units, includes 2 greaseless, EcoQuietTM units designed to reduce noise when operating in proximity to urban areas as well as 6 units that offer greaseless electric wireline used to reach further depths in longer laterals. Our fleet is deployed through 10 operating locations concentrated in Texas and the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions, as well as in Louisiana and North Dakota.

• | Coiled Tubing Services. Coiled tubing is another important element of the well servicing industry that allows operators to continue production during service operations on a well under pressure without shutting in the well, thereby reducing the risk of formation damage. Coiled tubing services involve the use of a continuous flexible metal pipe which is spooled on a large reel and inserted into the wellbore to perform a variety of oil and natural gas well applications, such as wellbore clean-outs, nitrogen jet lifts, through-tubing fishing, formation stimulation utilizing acid, chemical treatments and fracturing. Coiled tubing is also used for a number of horizontal well applications, such as milling temporary plugs between frac stages.

Our fleet consists of 4 small-diameter and 5 large-diameter (larger than two inches) units, which are deployed through 2 operating locations that provide services in Texas, Wyoming and surrounding areas.
Industry Overview 
Demand for oilfield services offered by our industry is a function of our clients’ willingness and ability to make operating expenditures and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons, which is primarily driven by current and expected oil and natural gas prices.
Our business is influenced substantially by exploration and production companies’ spending that is generally categorized as either a capital expenditure or an operating expenditure.
Capital expenditures by oil and gas exploration and production companies tend to be relatively sensitive to volatility in oil or natural gas prices because project decisions are tied to a return on investment spanning a number of months or years. As such, capital expenditure economics often require the use of commodity price forecasts which may prove inaccurate over the amount of time necessary to plan and execute a capital expenditure project (such as a drilling program for a number of wells in a certain area). When commodity prices are depressed for longer periods of time, capital expenditure projects are routinely deferred until prices are forecasted to return to an acceptable level.
In contrast, both mandatory and discretionary operating expenditures are more stable than capital expenditures as these expenditures are less sensitive to commodity price volatility. Mandatory operating expenditure projects involve activities that cannot be avoided in the short term, such as regulatory compliance, safety, contractual obligations and certain projects to maintain the well and related infrastructure in operating condition. Discretionary operating expenditure projects may not 
7

be critical to the short-term viability of a lease or field and are generally evaluated according to a simple short-term payout criterion that is less dependent on commodity price forecasts.
Capital expenditures for the drilling and completion of exploratory and development wells in proven areas are more directly influenced by current and expected oil and natural gas prices and generally reflect the volatility of commodity prices. In contrast, operating expenditures for the maintenance of existing wells, for which a range of production services are required in order to maintain production, are relatively more stable and predictable.
Drilling and production services have historically trended similarly in response to fluctuations in commodity prices. However, because exploration and production companies often adjust their budgets for exploration and development drilling first in response to a change in commodity prices, the demand for drilling services is generally impacted first and to a greater extent than the demand for production services which is more dependent on ongoing expenditures that are necessary to maintain production. Additionally, within the range of production services businesses, those that derive more revenue from production-related activity, as opposed to completion of new wells, tend to be less affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and temporary reductions in industry activity.
However, in a severe downturn that is prolonged, both operating and capital expenditures are significantly reduced, and the demand for all our service offerings is significantly impacted. After a prolonged downturn, among the production services, the demand for completion-oriented services generally improves first, as exploration and production companies begin to complete wells that were previously drilled but not completed during the downturn, and to complete newly drilled wells as the demand for drilling services improves during recovery.
The level of exploration and production activity within a region can fluctuate due to a variety of factors which may directly or indirectly impact our operations in the region. From time to time, temporary regional slowdowns or constraints occur in our industry due to a variety of factors, including, among others, infrastructure or takeaway capacity limitations, labor shortages, increased regulatory or environmental pressures, or an influx of competitors in a particular region. Any of these factors can influence the profitability of operations in the affected region. However, term contract coverage for our drilling services business and the mobility of all our equipment between regions reduces our exposure to the impact of regional constraints and fluctuations in demand.
Additionally, because our business depends on the level of spending by our clients, we are also affected by our clients’ ability to access the capital markets. After several consecutive years without significant improvement in commodity prices, many exploration and production companies have limited their spending to a level which can be supported by net operating cash flows alone, as access to the capital markets through debt or equity financings has become more challenging in our industry. 
Our industry experienced a severe down cycle from late 2014 through 2016, during which WTI oil prices dipped below $30 per barrel in early 2016. A modest recovery in commodity prices began in the latter half of 2016 with WTI oil prices steadily increasing from just under $50 per barrel at the end of June 2016 to approximately $60 per barrel at the end of 2017. WTI oil prices continued to increase to a high of $75 per barrel in October 2018, but then decreased to $45 per barrel at the end of 2018. Despite some improvement in 2019, WTI oil prices have, on average, remained in the $55 to $60 per barrel range. However, in early 2020, oil and gas prices have fallen below $50 per barrel, largely in response to concerns about coronavirus and its potential impact on worldwide demand for oil. 
8

The trends in spot prices of WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas, and the resulting trends in domestic land rig counts (per Baker Hughes) and domestic well servicing rig counts (per Guiberson/Association of Energy Service Companies) over the last three years are illustrated in the graphs below.
Colombian oil prices have historically trended in line with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices. Demand for drilling and production services in Colombia is largely dependent upon its national oil company’s long-term exploration and production programs, and to a lesser extent, additional activity from other producers in the region.
Technological advancements and trends in our industry also affect the demand for certain types of equipment, and can affect the overall demand for the services our industry provides. Enhanced directional and horizontal drilling techniques have allowed exploration and production operators to drill increasingly longer lateral wellbores which enable higher hydrocarbon production per well and reduce the overall number of wells needed to achieve the desired production. The trend in our industry toward fewer, but longer, lateral wellbores has led to an overall reduction in drilling and completion activity and demand for the equipment in our industry that is more heavily weighted toward the more specialized equipment available, such as high-spec drilling rigs, higher horsepower well servicing rigs equipped with taller masts, larger diameter coiled tubing units, and other higher power ancillary equipment, which is needed to drill, complete, and provide services to the full length of the wellbore. Our domestic drilling and production services fleets are highly capable and designed for operation in today’s long lateral, pad-oriented environment.
For additional information concerning the potential effects of volatility in oil and gas prices and other industry trends, see Item 1A – “Risk Factors” in Part I and in the section entitled “Market Conditions and Outlook” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
We encounter substantial competition from other drilling contractors and other oilfield service companies. Our primary market areas are highly fragmented and competitive. The fact that drilling and production services equipment are mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry and may result in an oversupply of equipment in an area. Contract drilling companies and other oilfield service companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and the intensity of competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. If demand for drilling or production services improves in a region where we operate, our competitors might respond by moving in suitable rigs and production services equipment from other regions. An influx of equipment from 
9

other regions could rapidly intensify competition, reduce profitability and make any improvement in demand for our services short-lived.
Most drilling services contracts and production services contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids, which also results in price competition. In addition to pricing and equipment availability, we believe the following factors are also important to our clients in determining which drilling services or production services provider to select:

• | the type, capability and condition of each of the competing drilling rigs, well servicing rigs, wireline units and coiled tubing units;


• | the mobility and efficiency of the equipment;


• | the quality of service and experience of the crews;


• | the reputation and safety record of the company providing the services;


• | the offering of integrated and/or ancillary services; and


• | the ability to provide drilling and production services equipment adaptable to, and personnel familiar with, new technologies and drilling and production techniques.

While we must be competitive in our pricing, our competitive strategy generally emphasizes the quality of our equipment, our safety record, our ability to offer ancillary services, the experience of our crews and the quality of service we provide to differentiate us from our competitors. This strategy is less effective when lower demand for drilling and production services intensifies price competition and makes it more difficult for us to compete on the basis of factors other than price. In all of the markets in which we compete, an oversupply of drilling rigs or production services equipment generally causes greater price competition and reduced profitability.
We believe that an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term client relationships is having an experienced, skilled and well-trained work force. In recent years, many of our larger clients have placed increased emphasis on the safety performance and quality of the crews, equipment and services provided by their contractors. We have devoted, and will continue to devote, substantial resources toward employee safety and training programs. Although price is generally the primary factor, we believe our clients consider all of these factors in determining which service provider is awarded the work, and that many clients are willing to pay a premium for the quality and safe, efficient service we provide.
The following is an overview of the market for each of our services:

• | Domestic and International Drilling. Our principal domestic drilling competitors are Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Precision Drilling Corporation, Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. and Nabors Industries Ltd. In Colombia, we primarily compete with Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Nabors Industries Ltd., Weatherford International plc, Petrex S.A., Independence Drilling S.A., Erazo Valencia S.A., Tuscany International Drilling and Estrella International Energy Services Ltd. Our current drilling rig fleet is 100% pad-capable and offers the latest advancements in pad drilling, which we believe positions us well to compete and expand our presence in predominant shale regions. 


• | Well Servicing. The well servicing providers that we primarily compete with are Key Energy Services, Basic Energy Services, NexTier Oilfield Services, Superior Energy Services, Forbes Energy Services and Ranger Energy Services, Inc. As compared to the other large competitors in this industry, we believe our fleet is one of the youngest, most uniform fleets, which in addition to our safety performance and service quality, has historically allowed us to operate at utilization and hourly rates that are among the highest of our peers.


• | Wireline. The wireline market in the United States is dominated by a small number of companies, including ourselves. These competitors include GR Energy Services, Allied-Horizontal Wireline Services, Renegade Services, NexTier Oilfield Services, Nine Energy Services, and Quintana Energy Services. Additional competitors include Baker Hughes Company, Schlumberger Ltd., Halliburton Company and other independents. The market for wireline services is very competitive, but historically we have competed effectively with our competitors because of the diversified services we provide, our performance, and strong client service.


• | Coiled Tubing. The market for coiled tubing has expanded within the oilfield services market over recent years due to technological advances that increased the variety of applications for the coiled tubing unit and due to the increase in deep well and horizontal drilling. Our primary competitors in the coiled tubing services market currently include NexTier Oilfield Services, Superior Energy Services, Key Energy Services, Schlumberger Ltd., Halliburton Company, Quintana Energy Services and RPC, Inc.

10

In addition, there are numerous smaller companies that compete in all of our services markets. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources than we do. Their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to:

• | better withstand industry downturns;


• | compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology;


• | better attract and retain skilled personnel; and


• | build new rigs or acquire and refurbish existing rigs and place them into service more quickly than us in periods of high drilling demand.

The need for our services fluctuates primarily in relation to the price (or anticipated price) of oil and natural gas, which in turn is driven by the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. The level of our revenues, earnings and cash flows are substantially dependent upon, and affected by, the level of domestic and international oil and gas exploration and development activity, as well as the equipment capacity in any particular region. For a more detailed discussion, see Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Clients
We provide drilling and production services to numerous oil and gas exploration and production companies. The following table shows our three largest clients as a percentage of our total revenue for each of our last two fiscal years.

 | Total RevenuePercentage
Year ended December 31, 2019 | 
Apache Corporation | 7.1 | %
Continental Resources, Inc. | 5.7 | %
Gran Tierra Energy, Inc. | 5.6 | %
Year ended December 31, 2018 | 
Gran Tierra Energy, Inc. | 8.1 | %
Apache Corporation | 5.9 | %
QEP Energy Company | 5.8 | %

Seasonality
All our production services operations are impacted by seasonal factors. Our business can be negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather, fewer daylight hours, holidays, and early exhaustion of our clients’ budgets. While our well servicing rigs, wireline units and coiled tubing units are mobile, during periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may not be able to move our equipment between locations. 
Employees
We currently have approximately 2,100 employees, the majority of which work in our drilling and production services operations and are primarily compensated on an hourly basis. The number of employees in operations fluctuates depending on the utilization of our drilling rigs, well servicing rigs, wireline units and coiled tubing units at any particular time. None of our employment arrangements are subject to collective bargaining arrangements.
Our operations require the services of employees having the technical training and experience necessary to achieve proper operational results. As a result, our operations depend, to a considerable extent, on the continuing availability of such personnel. From time to time, shortages of qualified personnel have occurred in our industry. Additionally, we may experience employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. If we should suffer any material loss of personnel or be unable to employ additional or replacement personnel with the requisite level of training and experience to adequately operate our equipment, our operations could be materially adversely affected. While we believe our wage rates are competitive and our relationships with our employees are satisfactory, a significant increase in the wages paid by other employers could result in a reduction in our workforce, increases in wage rates, or both. The occurrence of either of these events for a significant period of time could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
11

Raw Materials
The materials and supplies we use in our drilling and production services operations include fuels to operate our equipment, drilling mud, drill pipe, drill collars, drill bits, cement and other job materials such as explosives, perforating guns and coiled tubing. We do not rely on a single source of supply for any of these items. From time to time, there have been shortages of drilling and production services equipment and supplies during periods of high demand. Shortages could result in increased prices for equipment or supplies that we may be unable to pass on to clients and could substantially lengthen the delivery times for equipment and supplies. Any significant delays in our obtaining equipment or supplies could limit our operations and jeopardize our relations with clients and could delay and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts for our rigs. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Facilities
Our operations are headquartered in San Antonio, Texas and we conduct our business operations through 25 regional offices located throughout the United States in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Mississippi, Louisiana and Kansas, and internationally in Colombia. These operating locations typically include leased real estate properties which are used for regional offices, storage and maintenance yards and employee housing sufficient to support our operations in the area. We own 10 real estate properties associated with our regional operations. 
Operating Risks and Insurance
Our operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in exploration and production activity, including the risks of:

• | blowouts;


• | cratering;


• | fires and explosions;


• | loss of well control;


• | collapse of the borehole;


• | damaged or lost drilling equipment; and


• | damage or loss from natural disasters.

Any of these hazards can result in substantial liabilities or losses to us from, among other things:

• | suspension of operations;


• | damage to, or destruction of, our property and equipment and that of others;


• | personal injury and loss of life;


• | damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations through which we drill; and


• | environmental damage.

We seek to protect ourselves from some but not all operating hazards through insurance coverage. However, some risks are either not insurable or insurance is available only at rates that we consider uneconomical. Those risks include, among other things, pollution liability in excess of relatively low limits. Depending on competitive conditions and other factors, we attempt to obtain contractual protection against uninsured operating risks from our clients. However, clients who provide contractual indemnification protection may not in all cases maintain adequate insurance or otherwise have the financial resources necessary to support their indemnification obligations. Our insurance or indemnification arrangements may not adequately protect us against liability or loss from all the hazards of our operations. The occurrence of a significant event that we have not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a client to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable.
Our current insurance coverage includes property insurance on our rigs, drilling equipment, production services equipment, and real property. Our insurance coverage for property damage to our rigs, drilling equipment and production services equipment is based on our estimates of the cost of comparable used equipment to replace the insured property. The policy provides for a deductible of no more than $750,000 per drilling rig and a deductible on production services equipment of $250,000 per occurrence, with an additional $350,000 annual aggregate deductible. Our third-party liability insurance coverage is $101 million per occurrence and in the aggregate, with a deductible of $250,000 per occurrence and an additional $250,000 annual aggregate deductible. We also carry insurance coverage for pollution liability up to $20 million with a deductible of $500,000. We believe that we are adequately insured for public liability and property damage to others with

respect to our operations. However, such insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against liability for all consequences of well disasters, extensive fire damage or damage to the environment.
Governmental Regulation
Many aspects of our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations, including laws and regulations governing:

• | environmental quality;


• | pollution control;


• | remediation of contamination;


• | preservation of natural resources;


• | transportation; and


• | worker safety.

Environment Protection. Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations governing the protection of the environment and human health and safety.
Some of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our industry relate to the disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of those substances that can be released into the environment. Several of those laws also require removal and remedial action and other cleanup under certain circumstances, commonly regardless of fault. Our operations routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials, some of which are classified as hazardous wastes and/or hazardous substances. Planning, implementation and maintenance of protective measures are required to prevent accidental discharges. Spills of oil, natural gas liquids, drilling fluids and other substances may subject us to penalties and cleanup requirements. Handling, storage and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are also subject to these regulatory requirements. In addition, our operations are often conducted in or near ecologically sensitive areas, such as wetlands, which are subject to special protective measures and which may expose us to additional operating costs and liabilities for accidental discharges of oil, gas, drilling fluids, contaminated water or other substances, or for noncompliance with other aspects of applicable laws and regulations.
Environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to frequent change. Failure to comply with governmental requirements or inadequate cooperation with governmental authorities could subject a responsible party to administrative, civil or criminal action. We may also be exposed to environmental or other liabilities originating from businesses and assets which we acquired from others. Our compliance with amended, new or more stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of contamination or regulatory noncompliance may require us to make material expenditures or subject us to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate.
There are a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the United States and international regions in which we operate that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases.
Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to concerns regarding potential environmental and physical impacts, including groundwater and drinking water impacts, as well as whether such activities may cause earthquakes. Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, incurred by our clients. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations or ordinances restricting or increasing the costs of hydraulic fracturing could cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our drilling and well servicing activities, any or all of which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Our wireline operations involve the use of radioactive isotopes along with other nuclear, electrical, acoustic, and mechanical devices. Our activities involving the use of isotopes are regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and specified agencies of certain states. Additionally, we use high explosive charges for perforating casing and formations, and we use various explosive cutters to assist in wellbore cleanout. Such operations are regulated by the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and require us to obtain licenses or other approvals for the use of 
13

densitometers as well as explosive charges. We have obtained these licenses and approvals when necessary and believe that we are in substantial compliance with these federal requirements.
In addition, our business depends on the demand for land drilling and production services from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, is affected by tax, environmental and other laws relating to the oil and gas industry generally, by changes in those laws and by changes in related administrative regulations. It is possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or those of our clients, or otherwise directly or indirectly affect our operations.
See Item 1A—“Risk Factors” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of risks we face concerning laws and governmental regulations.
Transportation. Among the services we provide, we operate as a motor carrier for the transportation of our own equipment and therefore are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, onboard black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size.
Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the U.S. Department of Transportation. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations.
From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.
Worker safety. Our ability to retain existing customers and attract new business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to demonstrate that we can reliably and safely operate our business in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and permits. An accident or other event resulting in significant environmental or property damage, or injuries or fatalities involving our employees or other persons could also trigger investigations by federal, state or local authorities. Such an accident or other event could cause us to incur substantial expenses in connection with the investigation, remediation and resolution, as well as cause lasting damage to our reputation, loss of customers and an inability to obtain insurance.
