ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 
ProtoKinetix, Incorporated (“ProtoKinetix,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a research and development stage bio-technology company focused on scientific medical research of AFGPs (Anti-Freeze Glycoproteins) or anti-aging glycoproteins, trademarked as AAGPs®.  The Company has recently been in the process of directing major efforts to the practical side of commercial validation. The commercial applications for AAGPs® in large markets such as targeted health care solutions are numerous, and ProtoKinetix is currently working with researchers, business leaders and advisors and commercial entities to bring AAGP® to market.

In July 2003, the Company entered into an assignment of license agreement with BioKinetix Research, Incorporated for the assignment of rights relating to proprietary technologies of BioKinetix Research, Incorporated for the creation and commercialization of “superantibodies.”  On July 8, 2003, the Company changed its name to “ProtoKinetix, Incorporated.”

Recent Developments
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, and any related adverse public health developments, has adversely affected workforces, economies, and financial markets globally, potentially leading to an economic downturn.
 
As of the date of this filing, the Company has regained a significant portion of its operational capacity and we continue to move forward with our research goals. Our supply of the patented AAGP® molecule has been manufactured and stored in the United States and we have adequate inventory to carry out the projects currently underway. In the last year, the Company engaged contract research organizations (CROs) located in both the United States and Canada. The CROs contracted by the Company for research projects have been able to meet milestone goals without disruption due to the pandemic.
 In January of 2020, Protokinetix signed a master supply agreement with University of Alberta that clears the way for testing of additional patients in the Phase I clinical trials. The global pandemic halted all work on clinical trials and research testing for most of 2020. We anticipate continuation of the Phase I trials in 2021 but cannot confidently predict a start date. We cannot predict future disruptions to the Company which may occur due to the spread of COVID-19. We continue to monitor the status of the pandemic and will adjust our strategy accordingly in order to mitigate the impact on our research projects.    Research and Development
 
Our business depends on our ability to sponsor research and development activities.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred total research and development expenses of $369,520.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred total research and development expenses of $527,921.  In order to reach the Company’s goals of developing a marketable product, we will need to increase the funding of our research and development activities which at this time is limited by our ability to raise money to fund the Company.
