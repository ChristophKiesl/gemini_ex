ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
MSC Industrial Direct Co., Inc. (together with its wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which it maintains a controlling financial interest, “MSC,” “MSC Industrial,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading North American distributor of a broad range of metalworking and maintenance, repair and operations (“MRO”) products and services. With a history of driving innovation in industrial product distribution for more than 80 years, we help solve our manufacturing customers’ metalworking, MRO and operational challenges. Through our technical metalworking expertise and inventory management and other supply chain solutions, our team of more than 6,500 associates helps to keep our customers’ manufacturing operations up and running and to improve their efficiency, productivity and profitability.
We serve a broad range of customers throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom, from individual machine shops to Fortune 1000 manufacturing companies to government agencies such as the United States General Services Administration and the United States Department of Defense. We operate a sophisticated network of 11 customer fulfillment centers (seven in the United States, three in Canada and one in the United Kingdom), seven regional inventory centers (all located in the United States), and 28 branch offices (20 in the United States, seven in Mexico and one in the United Kingdom). Of these branch offices, 10 are new to MSC as a result of the fiscal year 2021 acquisitions. Our primary customer fulfillment centers are located in or near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Atlanta, Georgia; Elkhart, Indiana; Reno, Nevada; and Columbus, Ohio in the United States. In addition, we operate six smaller customer fulfillment centers in or near Hanover Park, Illinois; and Shelbyville, Kentucky (repackaging and replenishment center) in the United States; Wednesbury, England in the United Kingdom; and Edmonton, Alberta; Beamsville, Ontario; and Moncton, New Brunswick in Canada. As part of our enhanced customer support model, we have recently transitioned from a branch office network to virtual customer care hubs. This transition included the closure of 73 branch offices during fiscal year 2021 and a realignment of certain existing locations from branch offices to regional inventory centers.
We offer approximately 1.9 million active, saleable stock-keeping units (“SKUs”) through our catalogs, our brochures, our eCommerce channels, including our website, mscdirect.com (the “MSC website”), our inventory management solutions, and our call centers, branch offices, customer fulfillment centers and regional inventory centers. We carry many of the products we sell in our inventory, so that orders for these in-stock products are processed and fulfilled the day the order is received. We offer next-day delivery nationwide for qualifying orders placed by 8 p.m. Eastern Time (excluding Class C (“Consumables”) category products). Our customers can choose among many convenient ways to place orders: the MSC website, eProcurement platforms, call centers or direct communication with our outside sales associates.
We believe that our value-added solutions approach to driving our customers’ success serves to differentiate MSC from traditional transaction-focused distributors. We endeavor to save our customers money when they partner with us for their metalworking and MRO product needs. We focus on building strong partnerships with our customers to help them improve their productivity and growth. We do this in several ways:
our experienced team includes customer care team members, metalworking specialists, safety specialists, inventory management specialists, technical support teams and experienced sales associates focused on driving our customers’ success by reducing their operational costs;
our robust systems and transactional data enable us to provide insights to our customers to help them take cost out of their supply chains and operations;
our extensive product inventory enables customers to deal with fewer suppliers, streamlining their purchasing work and reducing their administrative costs; 
our timely shipping enables our customers to reduce their inventory investment and carrying costs; 
our purchasing process consolidates multiple purchases into a single order, providing a single invoice for multiple purchases over time and offering direct shipments to specific departments and personnel at one or more facilities. This reduces our customers’ administrative costs;
our extensive eCommerce capabilities provide sophisticated search and transaction capabilities, access to real-time inventory, customer-specific pricing, workflow management tools, customized reporting and other features. We can also interface directly with many purchasing portals;
our inventory management solutions enable our customers to carry less inventory and still significantly reduce situations when a critical item is out of stock;
our proprietary software solution, called Ap Op (Application Optimization), enables our metalworking specialists to document productivity savings for customers for a range of applications, including grinding, milling, turning, threading, sawing, hole-making, metalworking fluids and other manufacturing process improvements; and




our exclusive service, MSC Millmax®, focuses on maximizing milling productivity and lowering cost by reducing the milling optimization process to a fraction of the time. MSC Millmax® helps customers increase material removal rates, reduce cycle times, improve surface finishes and extend tool life, leading to improved productivity, quality and cost savings.

Industry Overview

MSC operates in a large, fragmented industry. National, regional and local distributors, retail outlets, small distributorships, online distributors, direct mail suppliers, large warehouse stores and manufacturers’ own sales forces all serve MRO customers. 

MSC differentiates itself in the industry by being a leading distributor of metalworking products. We have continued to expand technical support and enhance supplier relationships, especially with our metalworking products. Our associates share their deep expertise and knowledge of metalworking and MRO products to help our customers achieve their goals.

Nearly every industrial and service business has an ongoing need for MRO supplies. These businesses, with the exception of the largest industrial plants, often do not have the resources to manage and monitor their MRO inventories effectively. They spend more than necessary to purchase and track their supplies, providing an opportunity for MSC to serve as their one-stop MRO product supplier. Even the larger facilities often store their supplies in multiple locations, so they often carry excess inventories and duplicate purchase orders. In many organizations, multiple people often acquire the same item in small quantities via expensive, one-off purchases, resulting in higher purchasing costs and administrative efforts to keep track of supplies. 

With limited capital availability and limited eCommerce capabilities and operating leverage, smaller industrial distributors are under increasing pressure to consolidate and/or curtail services and product lines to remain competitive. Their challenge represents MSC’s opportunity. We improve purchasing efficiency and reduce costs for our customers because our offerings enable our customers to consolidate suppliers, purchase orders and invoices, and reduce inventory tracking, stocking decisions, purchases and out-of-stock situations. In addition, through Vendor Managed Inventory (“VMI”), Customer Managed Inventory (“CMI”) and vending solutions, we empower our customers to utilize sophisticated inventory management solutions.

Business Strategy

MSC’s business strategy is based on helping our customers become more productive and profitable by reducing their total cost for purchasing, using and maintaining metalworking and MRO supplies. Leveraging our expertise, knowledge and experience with metalworking products will continue to be a key tenet of our business and growth strategy. Our customer-focused culture and high-touch engagement model drives value for our customers and results in deep customer relationships. Our strategy includes the following key elements:

Technical Expertise and Support. We provide technical support and one-on-one service through our field and customer care center representatives.  We have a dedicated team of more than 100 metalworking specialists who work with customers to improve their manufacturing processes and efficiency, as well as a technical support team that provides assistance to our sales teams and customers via phone and email. These metalworking specialists are customer-facing and work side-by-side with our customers. We utilize our Application Optimization proprietary software to capture the application data and to deliver documented cost savings to our customers. Our exclusive service, MSC Millmax®, focuses on maximizing milling productivity and lowering cost by reducing the milling optimization process to a fraction of the time. Our customers recognize the value of a distributor that can provide technical support to improve their operations and productivity.

Inventory Management Solutions. Our approach starts with a thorough customer assessment. Our expert associates develop and recommend solutions that provide exceptional value to the customer. Depending on the customer’s size and needs, we customize options to address complexity and processes, as well as specific products, technical issues and cost targets. The options include eProcurement, CMI, VMI, vending, tool crib control or in-plant solutions. Our world-class sourcing, logistics and business systems provide predictable, reliable and scalable service.

Broad Selection of Products. Customers want a full range of product options, even as they look to reduce the number of suppliers they partner with. We provide “good-better-best” alternatives, comprising a spectrum of brand name, MSC exclusive brand and generic MRO products. MSC’s broad selection of products enables customers to choose the right combination of price and quality on every purchase to meet their needs. 


Same-Day Shipping and Next-Day Delivery. We guarantee same-day shipping of our core metalworking and MRO products, enabling customers to reduce supply inventories. We fulfill our same-day shipment guarantee for in-stock products about 99% of the time. We offer next-day delivery nationwide for qualifying orders placed by 8 p.m. Eastern Time (excluding Consumables category products). We know that our customers value this service, and areas accessible by next-day delivery generate significantly greater sales for MSC than areas where next-day delivery is not available. 

Superior Customer Service. Our commitment to customer service starts with our many associates who share their deep expertise and knowledge of metalworking and MRO products to help our customers achieve greater success. We invest in sophisticated information systems and provide extensive training to empower our associates to better support our customers. Using our proprietary customer support software, our in-bound sales representatives can: inform customers on a real-time basis of product availability; recommend substitute products; verify credit information; receive special, custom or manufacturer direct orders; cross-check inventory items using previously entered customer product codes; and arrange or provide technical assistance. We offer: customized billing; customer savings reports; electronic data interchange ordering; eCommerce capabilities; bulk discounts; and stocking of specialty items requested by customers.

Commitment to Technological Innovation. We embrace technological innovations to support our growth, improve customer service and reduce our operating costs. The innovations make our buying practices more effective, improve our automated inventory replenishment and streamline order fulfillment. MSC’s proprietary software helps our customers and sales representatives determine the availability of products in real time and evaluate alternative products and pricing. The MSC website contains a searchable online catalog with electronic ordering capabilities. The MSC website also offers an array of services, workflow management tools and related information. Our warehouses are automated through the use of advanced systems and robotics platforms that allow us to rapidly process orders for next-day delivery, with greater efficiency.

We also continually upgrade our distribution methods and systems and provide comprehensive electronic ordering capabilities to support our customers’ purchase order processing. We continue to invest in our VMI, CMI and vending solutions that streamline customer replenishment and trim our customers’ inventories. Our vending solutions include different kinds of machines, such as storage lockers or carousels, which can stand alone or be combined with other machines. MSC vending machines use network or web-based software to enable customers to gain inventory visibility, save time and drive profitability.

Digital Technologies and the MSC Website. The MSC website provides personalized real-time inventory availability, superior search capabilities, online bill payment, delivery tracking status, and other enhancements, including work-flow management tools. The user-friendly search engine allows customers to find SKUs by keyword, part description, competitive part number, vendor number or brand. The MSC website is a key component of our strategy to reduce our customers’ transaction costs and delivery time. 

Competitive Pricing. Customers increasingly evaluate their total cost of purchasing, using and maintaining industrial supplies and recognize that price is an important aspect of their procurement costs. We make sure our pricing is competitive while reflecting the value that we bring through our comprehensive services.

Growth Strategy

Our growth strategy includes a number of initiatives to gain market share and complete the repositioning of MSC from being a spot buy supplier to a mission-critical partner to our customers. These initiatives include the following:

Expanding and enhancing our metalworking capabilities to aggressively penetrate customers in heavy and light manufacturing. MSC is a leading distributor of metalworking products in North America. We have continued to expand technical support and enhance supplier relationships. We are continuing to develop high-performance metalworking products marketed under MSC exclusive brands, providing high-value product alternatives for our customers. Our metalworking field specialists and centralized technical support team members have diverse backgrounds in machining, programming, management and engineering. They help our customers select the right tool for the job from our deep supplier base and exclusive brands.

Expanding programs for government and national account customers. Although MSC has been providing metalworking and MRO supplies to the commercial sector for more than 80 years, we continue to focus on government customers and have a large contract business with numerous federal, state and local agencies. We have developed customized government and national account programs. We see opportunity for additional growth in this area. 

We provide customized national account programs for larger customers, often on an enterprise-wide basis. These national account customers value our ability to support their procurement needs electronically to reduce their transactional 


costs. Our dedicated national account managers and operations experts provide supply chain solutions that reduce these customers’ total costs of procurement and ownership through increased visibility into their MRO purchases and improved management. We demonstrate these savings by providing these customers with detailed reporting at both the enterprise and site level.

Increasing the size and improving the productivity of our direct sales force. We have invested resources to give our sales representatives more time with our customers and provide increased support during the MRO purchasing process. At August 28, 2021, our field sales and service associate headcount was 2,398. We believe that our sales force investment has played a critical role in the overall success of the Company’s revenue performance. During fiscal year 2021, the Company announced a transition from the branch office network to virtual customer care hubs. This plan included the reduction of management and other positions within the commercial sales organization. We also have migrated our sales force from one designed to sell a spot buy value proposition to one prepared to deliver upon the new, more complex and high-touch role that we play, driving value for our customers by enabling them to achieve higher levels of growth, profitability and productivity.

Increasing sales from existing customers and generating new customers with various value-added programs. Our value-added programs include business needs analysis, inventory management solutions and workflow management tools. Our customers particularly value our industrial vending solutions that can accommodate a range of products from precision cutting tools to MRO supplies. We are increasing investments in vending, VMI and our growing in-plant solutions program.

Increasing the number of product lines and productive SKUs. We offer approximately 1.9 million active, saleable SKUs through our eCommerce channels, including the MSC website, inventory management solutions, catalogs, brochures and call centers and branch offices. The majority of products sold are third-party manufactured products; however, SKUs sold under MSC private label brands approximate 15% of net sales. We are increasing the breadth and depth of our product offerings and pruning non-value-added SKUs. In fiscal year 2021, we added approximately 55,000 SKUs, net of SKU removals, to our active, saleable SKU count. We also leverage the depth and breadth of MSC’s product portfolio within our Consumables category sales channel. We plan to continue adding SKUs in fiscal year 2022. 

Improving our marketing programs. MSC has built an extensive buyer database, which we harness via both human and artificial intelligence to target our marketing to the best prospects. We supplement the efforts of our sales force through the use of digital and traditional marketing tactics. Our industry-specific expertise allows us to focus our outreach on the most promising growth areas. 

Enhancing eCommerce capabilities. The MSC website is a proprietary, business-to-business, horizontal marketplace serving the metalworking and MRO market. The MSC website allows customers to enjoy added convenience without sacrificing customized service. The MSC website is a key component of our strategy to reduce customers’ transaction costs and internal requisition time. MSC continues to evaluate the MSC website and solicit customer feedback, making on-going improvements to ensure that it remains a premier website in our marketplace. ​The MSC website provides advanced features, such as order approval (workflow) and purchase order control, that our customers interact with in order to derive business value beyond merely placing an order. Many large customer accounts transact business with MSC using eProcurement solution providers that sell a suite of eCommerce products. We have associations with many of these providers and continue to evaluate and expand our eProcurement capabilities.

Improving our excellent customer support service. MSC consistently receives high customer satisfaction ratings, according to customer surveys. By working to anticipate our customers’ requirements, we strive to exceed our customers’ expectations. This focus on our customers’ needs enables us to achieve our goal to stand apart in the market. We use customer comment cards, surveys and other customer outreach tools, using their feedback to improve the overall customer experience.

Selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions and investments. MSC is a leader in the highly fragmented industrial distribution market with significant opportunities for organic and acquisitive growth. We selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that deepen our metalworking expertise, extend our capabilities into strategic adjacencies, and expand our markets in North America. We also seek to target investments in businesses and other ventures which we believe offer opportunities for growth and improved operational performance for our business.

In June 2021, the Company acquired a majority ownership interest in Wm. F. Hurst Co., LLC (“Hurst”), a Wichita, Kansas-based distributor of metalworking tools and supplies. Hurst has deep expertise and relationships in the aerospace industry, which we believe will contribute to the growth of the Company’s metalworking base and serve as a center of excellence for expanding its technical capabilities in the aerospace sector. The Company holds an 80% interest in the business, which will continue to do business under the Wm. F. Hurst brand. 


In February 2019, two subsidiaries of the Company, MSC IndustrialSupply, S. de R.L. de C.V. and MSC Import Export LLC (together, “MSC Mexico”), completed the acquisition of certain assets of TAC Insumos Industriales, S. de R.L. de C.V. and certain of its affiliates (together, “TAC”). The Company holds a 75% interest in each of the MSC Mexico entities. In July 2021, MSC Mexico acquired additional assets of TAC in conjunction with the acquisition of its outsourcing and logistics businesses. Following this latest acquisition, the Company retains its 75% interest in MSC Mexico. The acquisition provides the Company with the opportunity to further expand its business throughout North America.

Intellectual Property

We conduct business under various trademarks and service marks. We protect these trademarks by maintaining registrations in the United States, Canada and elsewhere. We also file for and obtain patents and use confidentiality and other agreements with customers, associates, consultants and others in order to protect our proprietary information. Although we do not believe our operations are substantially dependent upon any of our intellectual property, we consider our intellectual property to be valuable to our business.
Products and Supplier Services

Our broad range of MRO products includes cutting tools, measuring instruments, tooling components, metalworking products, fasteners, flat stock, raw materials, abrasives, machinery hand and power tools, safety and janitorial supplies, plumbing supplies, materials handling products, power transmission components and electrical supplies. Our large and growing number of SKUs makes us an increasingly valuable partner to our customers as they look to trim their supplier base. Our assortment from multiple product suppliers and MSC exclusive brands, prices and quality levels enables our customers to select from “good-better-best” options on nearly all of their purchases. Our extensive network of suppliers provides us access to technical application, safety, training certifications and many other value-added services for our customers. We stand apart from our competitors by offering name brand, exclusive brand, and generic products, depth in our core product lines, and competitive pricing. 

We purchase substantially all of our products directly from approximately 3,000 suppliers. No single supplier accounted for more than 6% of our total purchases in fiscal year 2021, 2020 or 2019.

Customer Fulfillment Centers

We continue to invest in the enhancement of our distribution efficiency and capabilities. When our customers order an in-stock product online or via phone, we ship it the day the order is placed about 99% of the time. We do that through our 11 customer fulfillment centers, seven regional inventory centers and 28 branch offices. Some specialty or custom items and very large orders are shipped directly from the manufacturer. We manage our primary customer fulfillment centers via computer-based SKU tracking systems and radio frequency devices that locate specific stock items to make the selection process more efficient. 
Sales and Marketing

We serve individual machine shops, Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies and manufacturers of all sizes. With our acquisitions of Barnes Distribution North America in fiscal year 2013 and AIS in fiscal year 2018, we have increased our presence in the fastener and Consumables product categories and significantly increased our presence in the VMI space. VMI involves not only the selling of the maintenance Consumables by our associates, but also the management of appropriate stock levels for the customer, fulfilling replenishment orders, putting away the stock, and maintaining a clean and organized inventory area. 

MSC’s government customers include both federal agencies and state governments. Federal government customers include the U.S. Postal Service, the Department of Defense, large and small military bases, Veterans Affairs hospitals, and correctional facilities. We have individual state contracts and also are engaged with several state cooperatives. 

Our national account program includes Fortune 1000 companies, large privately held companies, and international companies primarily doing business in North America. We have identified hundreds of additional national account prospects and have given our sales team tools to ensure we are targeting prospective customers that best fit the MSC model. 

We have implemented advanced analytics and significantly increased the return on our marketing investments designed to acquire new customers and increase our share of business with current customers. The majority of our efforts are focused on search engine marketing, email marketing and online advertising to address changes in our customers’ buying 


behavior and we utilize master catalogs and direct mail on a selective basis. We use our own database of over three million contacts together with external information to target buyers with the highest likelihood to buy. 

Our sales representatives are highly trained and experienced individuals who build relationships with customers, assist customers in reducing costs, provide and coordinate technical support, coordinate special orders and shipments with vendors, and update customer account profiles in our information systems databases. Our marketing approach centers on the ability of our sales representatives, armed with our comprehensive databases as a resource, to respond effectively to the customers’ needs. When a customer places a call to MSC, the sales representative on the other end of the line has immediate access to that customer’s company and specific buyer profile, which includes billing and purchasing track records, and plant and industry information. Meanwhile, the sales representative has access to inventory levels on every SKU we carry. 

Our in-bound sales representatives at our customer care centers undergo an intensive seven-week training course, followed up by regular training seminars and workshops. We monitor and evaluate our sales associates at regular intervals and provide our sales associates with technical training by our in-house specialists and product vendors. We maintain a separate technical support group dedicated to answering customer inquiries and assisting our customers with product operation information and finding the most efficient solutions to manufacturing problems.

Branch Offices

We operate 28 branch offices, of which 20 are located within the United States, seven are located in Mexico and one is located in the United Kingdom. Of these branch offices, 10 are new to MSC as a result of the fiscal year 2021 acquisitions. As part of our enhanced customer support model implemented in fiscal year 2021, we transitioned from the branch office network to virtual customer care hubs. This transition included the closure of 73 branch offices and a reduction of management and other positions within the commercial sales organization. Despite the transition, our virtual customer care hubs continue to play an integral role in obtaining new accounts and penetrating existing ones.
Publications

Our primary method of presenting products and solutions is the MSC website and our digital marketing programs. However, we continue to leverage master catalogs, along with specialty and promotional catalogs and brochures, where appropriate. We use specialty and promotional publications to target customers in specific areas, such as metal fabrication, facilities management and safety and janitorial. Specialty and promotional catalogs, targeted to our best prospects, offer a more focused selection of products. While traditional marketing tactics such as master catalogs, promotional catalogs and brochures continue to play a role in our efforts, our primary forms of marketing are digital platforms, such as search engine marketing, email marketing and online advertising, to align with changes in our customers’ buying behavior and to maximize marketing productivity and return on marketing dollars spent. 
Customer Service

One of our goals is to make purchasing our products as convenient as possible.  Customers submit approximately 60% of their orders digitally through our technology platforms (the MSC website, vending machines and eProcurement). The remaining orders are primarily placed via telephone, fax and mail. The efficient handling of orders is a critical aspect of our business. Order entry and fulfillment occurs at each of our branch offices and our main customer care centers, mostly located at our customer fulfillment centers. Customer care phone representatives enter non-digital orders into computerized order processing systems. In the event of a local or regional situation, our communications system will reroute customer exchanges to an alternative location. When an order enters the system, a credit check is performed; if the credit is approved, the order is usually transmitted to the customer fulfillment center closest to the customer. Customers are invoiced for merchandise, shipping and handling promptly after shipment.
Information Systems

Our information systems enable us to centralize management of key functions across our business. These systems help us to ship on a same-day basis, respond quickly to order changes, provide a high level of customer service, and manage our operational costs. In fiscal year 2019, we incorporated further robotic-driven automation into our customer fulfillment centers. Our eCommerce environment is built upon a combined platform of our own intellectual property and state-of-the-art software from the world’s leading internet technology providers and is powered by world-class product data. This powerful combination of resources helps us deliver a superior online shopping experience with world-class levels of reliability.

Most of our information systems operate in real time over a wide area network, letting each customer fulfillment center and virtual customer care hub share information and monitor daily progress on sales activity, credit approvals, 


inventory levels, stock balancing, vendor returns, order fulfillment and other key performance measures. We maintain a sophisticated buying and inventory management system that monitors all of our SKUs and automatically purchases inventory from vendors for replenishment, based on proprietary forecasting models. We also maintain an Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) purchasing program with our vendors to boost order placement efficiency, reduce order cycle processing time, and increase order accuracy.

In addition to developing the proprietary computer software programs for use in the customer service and distribution operations, we also provide a comprehensive EDI and Extensible Markup Language (“XML”) ordering system to support our customer-based purchase order processing. 

As part of our commitment to creating services that fuel the potential of our customers, we develop and maintain a suite of proprietary VMI digital solutions. These VMI digital solutions allow our customers to focus on their core business, while MSC manages their inventory ordering, fulfillment and replenishment. Our various VMI digital solutions are customizable to meet both simple and complex customer needs. Our scanning solutions integrate scanner accumulated orders directly into our Sales Order Entry system and the MSC website. Our CMI enables customers to simply and effectively replenish inventory by submitting orders directly to the MSC website. Our customized vending solutions are used by customers in manufacturing plants across the United States to help them achieve supply chain and shop floor optimization, through inventory optimization and reduced tooling and labor costs. All of our digital solutions function directly as front-end ordering systems for our e-Portal-based customers. These solutions take advantage of advanced technologies built upon the latest innovations in eCommerce and wireless and cloud-based computing.

Our core business systems run in a highly distributed computing environment and utilize world-class software and hardware platforms from key partners. We utilize disaster recovery techniques and procedures, which are consistent with best practices in enterprise information technology (“IT”). Our IT associates moved rapidly and effectively to provide nearly the entire Company with remote access in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began causing significant macroeconomic disruption in the United States. As the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2020, we shifted permanently to a remote working model for most associates. In addition to deploying secure home computing assets, we implemented collaboration software to enable interconnected teams and scalable video conferencing for large virtual gatherings.

We believe that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates are adequate to support our current needs. Over the next few years, we will also be upgrading and migrating many of our systems to take advantage of the flexibility and controls offered by cloud computing platforms while downsizing our on premise data center footprint. Recent cloud migrations include commercial off the shelf enterprise systems as well as our eCommerce infrastructure. 

Our sales representatives are equipped with proprietary mobile technology that allows them to tap into MSC’s supply chain directly from our customers’ manufacturing plants and make sure that critical inventory is always on site and available. In addition, we are enhancing our customer websites and portals to reflect this new mobile reality at a pace in line with customer adoption of mobile technology.

Our customer care centers and branch offices are powered via state-of-the-art telephony, case management and workforce optimization platforms. The features within the platforms create a seamless environment equipped with advanced applications that assist our associates in optimizing our customers’ experience. The architecture has established a dynamic infrastructure that is scalable both in terms of operations and future capabilities. We are continuing to implement additional functionality aimed at enhancing the engagement and personalization of the customer experience regardless of the contact method chosen.

Competition

The MRO supply industry is a large, fragmented industry that is highly competitive. We face competition from: traditional channels of distribution, such as retail outlets, small dealerships, regional and national distributors utilizing direct sales forces, manufacturers of MRO supplies, large warehouse stores, and larger direct mail distributors. We also face substantial competition in the online distribution space that competes with price transparency and includes both traditional distributors and non-traditional, web-based eCommerce competitors. In addition, new entrants in the MRO supply industry could increase competition. We believe that sales of MRO supplies will become more concentrated over the next several years, which may make MRO supply distribution more competitive. Some of our competitors challenge us with a greater variety of product offerings, greater financial resources, additional services, or a combination of these factors. In the industrial products market, customer purchasing decisions are based primarily on one or more of the following criteria: price, product selection, product availability, technical support relationship, level of service and convenience. We believe we compete effectively on all such criteria. Our industry has seen consolidation in recent years. The trend of our industry toward consolidation could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by 


competitors, or as competitors with new lower-cost business models are able to operate with lower prices and gross profit on products. 

Seasonality

During any given time, we may be impacted by our industrial customers’ plant shutdowns, particularly during the summer months (our fiscal fourth quarter), as well as the winter months for the Christmas and New Year holiday period (our fiscal second quarter). In addition, we may be impacted by weather-related disruptions and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Compliance with Health and Safety and Environmental Protection Laws

Our operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and non-U.S. health and safety and environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure that our operations are compliant with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.

Operating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal and recurring part of our operations. With respect to all other matters that may currently be pending, in the opinion of management, based on our analysis of relevant facts and circumstances, compliance with applicable environmental laws is not likely to have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 

Human Capital Resources

As of August 28, 2021, we employed 6,571 associates worldwide, of which approximately 6,372 were full-time and 199 were part-time. No associate is represented by a labor union. Approximately 90% of our workforce is based in the United Sates and approximately 10% is based outside of the United States. MSC has not experienced any major work stoppages and considers associate relations to be good. 

Our goal is to attract, develop and retain a talented team of associates inspired by our greater purpose of fueling the potential of our stakeholders. We believe a career at MSC includes:
Purpose – MSC helps to fuel the industrial economy, propel our stakeholders’ success, and contribute to our customers’ growth.
People and Respect – MSC cares about people. We strive to offer a positive work environment, with people you like and leaders you can respect. 
Health and Well-being – MSC offers many available options for our associates and their families to be healthy and plan for the future.
Rewards and Recognition – Appreciation for our associates’ contributions and the opportunity to share financially and intrinsically in MSC’s success. 
Growth – The opportunity to learn, take risks and develop a career. 

At MSC, we refer to our workforce as our team of “associates,” rather than employees, because we believe that our associates have a stake in our success. We rely on each other to be as dedicated to MSC as MSC is dedicated to each associate. This is a critical part of our expectations of our associates and a unique part of our culture.
Health and Safety
MSC’s safety vision is to build a culture in which safety is a top priority across all levels of the organization, and that every associate has the right and responsibility to continually seek to prevent injuries and build a safe environment for everyone. Our leadership team is highly engaged through our Safety Leadership System in identifying trends in our incidents throughout the network and working collaboratively with our Safety Professionals to effectively reduce incidents involving our associates and to make MSC one of the safest places to work.
Our work over the last three calendar years has resulted in a 48.4% reduction in Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) recordable injuries throughout MSC. In calendar year 2020, the Company’s OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate was 1.01 and the Company’s OSHA Lost Time Incident Rate was 0.48 based upon the number of incidents per 100 associates (or per 200,000 work hours). The Company’s rates fall well below the Total Recordable Incident Rate and the Lost Time Incident Rate of the North American Industry Classification System, which were 2.20 and 0.70, respectively. The success of our Safety Leadership System was additionally validated through the completion and re-


certification to the ISO 45001 Standard in our Columbus, Ohio customer fulfillment center. We are expanding our efforts to achieve ISO 45001 certification throughout the supply chain network in the coming years. 
Our number one priority is the health and safety of our associates and their families, our customers, and our other partners. We have taken and will continue to take measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection and to protect our associates and our business, in line with guidelines issued by the authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including federal, state and local governments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We have instituted enhanced safety procedures to safeguard the health and safety of our associates, including the use of additional PPE and the frequent cleaning of our facilities. We have restricted non-associate access to our sites, reorganized our workflows where permitted to maximize social distancing, implemented extensive restrictions on associate travel, and utilized remote working strategies where possible.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
MSC is committed to promoting a respectful, diverse workplace, constructive collaboration, innovative creativity, and genuine leadership. We believe that our culture and our business benefit greatly from the rich combination of experience, creativity and perspective that our diverse workforce provides. Our associates' differences – the individual characteristics, work styles, beliefs and backgrounds – make us strong and equip us to better serve our customers. Because we are dedicated to an environment of equal opportunity, we partner with several outreach organizations that help us in our recruitment efforts such as: Hiring our Heroes, minority-owned organizations, women-owned organizations, local and state workforce services, and vocational rehab centers.
Talent Acquisition and Development
MSC focuses on creating opportunities for associate growth, development and training education, offering a comprehensive talent program that continues throughout an associate’s career. MSC believes that its future success is highly dependent upon the Company’s continued ability to attract, retain and motivate associates. As part of its efforts in these areas, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to meet the diverse needs of team members and support their health and well-being, financial future and work-life balance. Associates are given access to health plan resources, disease management, tobacco cessation, parental support, stress management and weight loss programs. In addition, MSC provides retirement savings, paid holidays and time off, educational assistance and income protection benefits, as well as a variety of other programs to its associates.

MSC also offers through MSC University various learning and development opportunities in support of associate career growth and success through a variety of offerings, including virtual classrooms and webinars, instructor-led courses, informal work groups, e-learning, books and articles, and more. These opportunities can drive improvement, facilitate career development, provide coaching and mentoring opportunities, and enhance communication skills. Associates were offered 426 types of learnings with 44,099 total hours completed by our associates in fiscal year 2021.
MSC’s tuition assistance program covers educational costs and provides eligible associates the financial assistance to obtain a graduate or undergraduate degree while working. MSC’s partnership with an accredited online university doubled associate participation in fiscal year 2021 by offering a full tuition grant when combined with the tuition assistance program.
