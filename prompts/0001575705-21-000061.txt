ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Overview.
 
Our management has 14 years previous experience in the solar industry, high purity quartz (“HPQ”) processing, and high purity quartz sand (“HPQS”) production and manufacturing industry. HPQS is an essential material for the production of photovoltaic solar panels and the high-end electronics and semiconductor industries. Planning has been completed to commence upon securing additional funding the establishment our new commercial production level factory in Townsville, Queensland, Australia to meet the increasing demand for new high purity quartz sand product. HPQS production worldwide seldom meets demand from the photovoltaic solar panel manufacturing and semi-conductor and high-end electronics industries.
 
Our technology team and our long-term technology associates have a proven track record of their production capability of commercial quality solar grade and potential semiconductor industry quality and purity products. The executive management team has 11 years’ experience in all facets of the production of specialized HPQ products critical for the high-end solar and electronics components industry.
 
We have mineral rights to the substantial supply of raw silica/quartz feedstock material through our wholly owned subsidiary, Solar Quartz Technologies Limited, a New Zealand private corporation (“SQTNZ”). This is ultra-high purity quartz deposit at our White Springs deposit (estimated at 1.5 million tons) and is located 170 miles inland from the major Australian shipping port of Townsville in the State of Queensland, Australia. The White Springs material is ideal for processing into HPQS with sufficient reserve to meet 15 to 20 years minimum of HPQS processing into solar crucible and high-end electronics grade high purity quartz sand. In addition, this subsidiary also has mining applications for the nearby Quartz Hill deposit that has an “AusIMM JORC” compliant inferred resource of 14 million tons of HPQ, ideal for processing into solar grade polysilicon metal, as well solar cell wafer production. These estimated tons of quartz available to the company under the right to mine.
 
HPQ and HPQS are essential primary feedstock materials required for the manufacturing of mono-crystalline solar grade silicon, through the Czochralski process, for the crucibles in which silicon ingots that solar cells are made from are produced. HPQS is also an essential ingredient required for the production of semiconductors and in fact all high-end electronics. HPQ is the only suitable material for this value-added processing as it shares the same element (silica) and is almost non-reactive, assuring high quality silicon ingots. Apart from this, HPQS also finds primary applications in advanced lighting, telecom, optic and microelectronics industry. HPQS powders are required for epoxy-molding compound used in manufacture of most electronic semiconductors, and is in a fast growth sector, which includes upgraded auto electronics for electric vehicles.
 
We are also primarily focused on the early development of new graphene enabled photovoltaic solar modules, including graphene enabled covered thin-film solar panels. In this production initiative, we entered into a non-binding Letter of Intent for a joint venture with NanoGraphene, Inc. (doing business as GrapheneCA), a New York based manufacturer with five years’ experience in the manufacture of pure graphene and of the development of newly evolving graphene enhanced high-tech applications, to jointly develop graphene enhanced solar solutions. Of substantial importance, the principal of GrapheneCA has twelve years of experience in the design, construction and establishment of numerous thin film solar production factories through-out the U.S., Europe and Asia. As of September 30,2020, the joint venture has not been formed nor have there been any operations related to the joint venture.
 
The development of graphene enhanced combination silicon materials is currently one of the most intensive areas of research and development, attracting major interests from most world University research divisions and new technology players. Massachusetts Institute of Technology has actually manufactured graphene solar panels.
 
The U.S. Government Solar Investment Tax Credit has stimulated solar panel production development and growth since its initial passage in 2006. In the last decade, solar energy has experienced an average annual growth rate of about 54%. Solar panel installations surged in 2016 ahead of potential drop down of this credit, but an extension in late 2015 has created federal policy stability through 2021. Although the solar panel manufacturing and installation industry is very competitive, our primary manufacturing material operations will not compete in that market as our area of expertise is that of producing the essential raw materials necessary to manufacture photovoltaic solar panels and semiconductors and is relatively competition free.

Operational Overview.
 
The constant demand for high purity quartz sand (HPQS) in high-end global markets has historically exceeded available supply, and the burgeoning global solar industry, due to the rapid growth of utility scale photovoltaic solar farm installations, and micro-grid networks, has substantially increased global demand for high purity quartz sand. The re-tooling of the semiconductor industry to produce nano-chips has also increased high purity quartz sand demand. Many high-tech industries have had to curtail production and expansion of the existing product ranges due to the global shortage of high purity quartz sand.
 
After three years of extensive development planning, the Company’s wholly owned New Zealand subsidiary registered, in September 2019, the business name (only), Global Advanced Energies Townsville (“GAET”). As of September 30, 2020 the New Zealand subsidiary company had not formed an operational subsidiary company under this name, but did extend the business name registration (only) until September 2021. Consequently, the company has no liabilities and no operations attributed under this business name. The company has the future intention to utilize this business name to establish an operational subsidiary company in Australia to undertake evolving alternative energy solutions production. The GAET technology management team plans to develop a multi-production factory hub that will require funding of approximately $200,000,000 over the first 3 years, consisting of the following 5 core initiatives/facilities:
 
1: PRE-PROCESSING MINE-SITE PRODUCTS: While the majority of mineral processing will take place at the mineral deposit sites by our Contract Miner, GAET will undertake final-stage quality sorting and washing to enable low-end products (known as SQ1, SQ2 and SQ3) to be prepared and packaged to required specifications for both domestic and export markets. The facility will also conduct final stage refining and processing, producing SQ-5 for export and feedstock for high-tech, clean room processing of HPQS (to be used in the solar and semi-conductor industries, and high-end-electronics, TV screens).
 
2: THIN FILM SOLAR GRAPHENE ENHANCED MODULE- The thin-film solar panel facility will utilize high grade HPQS to enhance panel capacity of 6MW, expanding to 24MW-36MW. The facility will introduce several graphene-enabled and enhanced panel applications that will further improve the generating properties of the graphene enabled thin film production and enhanced energy conversion efficiencies, creating a more competitive and sustainable product. The quality product is suitable for a number of applications including remote and grid-tied power stations, building integration and the electronics sector.
 
3: GRAPHENE - HIGH PURITY MANUFACTURING-This facility will focus on establishing high efficiency and volume graphene production facilities to achieve high-quality, eco-friendly, and scalable graphene production in 2020. This initial factory will produce 1.5 tonnes per month (expanding to 12 tonnes +) of medical grade and industrial graphene suitable for applications such as cement 3D printing resin- coatings, epoxy resins and composites, as well as high-end medical connections of brain stem cells and lenses.
 
4: GREEN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION & AMBIENT AIR - WATER HARVESTING (Unique GAET proprietary technology). Water scarcity is at the center of the world’s most significant challenges. The United Nations estimates approximately 30% of the world’s population will face severe water shortages by 2025. Management of the Company has developed a unique proprietary water harvesting technology utilizing modular, self-contained units that can be solar or grid powered, and deployed in urban and rural environments. The water harvester will extract moisture from the ambient air and collect as 100% pure fresh water. Each domestic water harvester will be capable of generating 30-50 liters (8-13 gal) of pure fresh water per day for personal use, with commercial models collecting up to 50,000 liters (13,000 gal) initially per day. The 100% pure H20 extracted from the atmosphere is also the perfect feed stock for the extraction of pure green hydrogen which is also planned as a major production initiative of the GAET facility complex.
 
5. AUSTRALIAN HPQS FACTORY. Subject to available capital, we are currently positioned to establish our new commercial scale (50,000 tonnes per annum) high purity quartz sand factory in Australia where it has substantial equipment and infrastructure already located. Production at the new high purity quartz sand (HPQS) factory will commence 6 to 8 months after funding and is expected to be profitable from the first year of operations. The total combined US$50 million factory financing will be a multi-staged investment, with US$10 million required initially to begin construction of the new Townsville, Queensland-located pre-processing plant to facilitate low-end unprocessed sale of quartz rock directly from the Quartz Hill mine site. The balance of funds will be used as set forth below. Funds may come from the sale of the shares in the primary offering or from providing shares to lenders or arrangers of debt financing, or a combination thereof.
 
5


Stage One – US$ 10 Million – Townsville Pre-Processing Factory “SQ1” and “SQ5” Products
 
The initial US$10 million application of funds will be specifically allocated to sponsor the generation of early revenue from sales of un-processed raw quartz directly from the Quartz Hill mine site. The raw quartz rock will be shipped to the new Townsville pre-processing factory for low-cost preparation involving high pressure washing, crushing and sizing, ready for shipping to international markets. Our management is confident of re-establishing previous issued US$200 Million plus orders from China and several other new emerging markets that require unprocessed high purity quartz for their own “value-adding” production centers. While we consider generation of early sales revenues is a vital function, the pre-processing factory will also produce “SQ5” feedstock for the new commercial scale high purity quartz sand factory to generate sales into the solar industry, semi-conductor and all high-end electronics markets. By building the new Townsville factory, Stage One funding will provide a base for international sales operations focusing on generating high volume, low-end sales revenues from largely unprocessed quartz. The factory is designed with more than enough production capacity to meet both SQ5 feedstock and low-end production demands.
Stage Two – US$ 35 Million – High Purity Quartz Sand Production Factory - “SQ7” Products
 
These funds will be required six months after the initial US$10 million funding. Funds will pay for establishing the fully operational solar grade, or crucible grade high purity quartz sand manufacturing facility. The factory will focus on manufacturing solar grade, or crucible grade high purity quartz sand products to industry standard purity grade high purity quartz sand for supply to all high-end electronics manufacturers. The solar industry utilizes SQ7 high purity quartz sand extensively. This operational segment is the most challenging, requiring almost spotless production facilities and high-tech clean rooms to insure ultimate high purity standards in the production process. Our technical team has a previous proven ability to meet these standards and successfully achieve appropriate production quality for solar and crucible grade high purity quartz sand.
 
Stage Three – HPQS Factory Up-Grade for Semi-Conductor Grade – “SQ9” Productions
 
With some variances the total $35 -$50 million funding is required within the first year and will be used to purchase additional high-level refining equipment and meet the cost of facility upgrades to the existing high purity quartz sand factory to facilitate production of SQ9 semi-conductor grade high purity quartz. This grade of high purity quartz is the highest purity and yields the largest profit margin. It is extensively used in the semiconductor industry for tool-ware applications and has consistent market demand. Semi-conductor grade SQ9 requires SQ7 solar grade high purity quartz sand as essential feedstock to enable manufacture of SQ9 semi-conductor grade HPQS.
 
Funding of the GAET Facilities
 
The Company is in the process of applying for grants and loans of up to $200,000,000 from two of the Australian federal government senior investment regional development funds as well as well as the local Townsville and Queensland state governmental authorities to fund a portion of the initiatives. To fund any shortfall, the Company is also planning to use its best efforts to raise funds in the form of debt or equity or a combination thereof in the US venture capital markets. All of these amounts represent the good faith estimate of Company management, but no assurance can be given that the Company will receive any funding from the Australian government (or if funds are received the amount thereof) or the receipt of funds to cover any shortfall.

Three HPQS Producers: United States, Norway and Russia.
 
There are only three commercial scale high purity quartz sand factories with the capability of processing HPQ raw quartz into commercial grade high purity quartz sand. They are located in the United States, Norway, and Russia; they collectively produce less than 60% of the increasing global demand for high purity quartz sand.
 
High purity quartz sand currently sells for US$8,000 to US$10,000 per ton with fluctuating pricing according to supply and demand. We can manufacture solar grade high purity quartz sand at a cost of US$2,000-$2,500 per ton. The global market price is predicted to keep increasing due to the ongoing global shortage of high purity quartz sand sufficient to meet the increasing demands of the burgeoning solar and high-end electronics and micro-electronics industries. We have previously operated a research design and a pilot plant production facility in Melbourne, Australia for six years primarily to create new and innovative cost-effective techniques for producing high purity quartz sand applications.
 
The establishment of the HPQS production plant will enable our company to supply HPQS and poly-silicon feedstock to meet pre-existing sales orders and new global demand necessitating the early establishment of the new HPQS production factory in Townsville, close to the HPQ mineral deposits. The second stage factory development will facilitate further processing of crucible grade HPQS into semiconductor grade quality that is always in very high demand.
 
The Quartz Hill deposit of 14 million tons of HPQ was previously the target of a joint venture mono-crystalline silicone production factory venture in Townsville, Australia with a leading manufacturer of photovoltaic solar panels (Hanwha QCell). Management believes that the compelling factor driving this initiative was the unusual high purity and extremely low-price HPQ that the company could supply to the project. The Quartz Hill deposit provides attractive opportunities for significant cost savings in the production of solar grade silicon metal for solar cell wafers. Hanwha had previously agreed upon a term sheet to purchase a 50% equity interest in the 14 million ton Quartz Hill HPQ deposit for $250 million. Closing of the transaction did not occur at the time due to Hanwha’s purchase of the majority equity of QCell, the German premier solar panel manufacturer.
 
We will not be dependent upon third party merchants or agents for the supply of raw feedstock material or the technology required to upgrade and provide value added processing to the quartz feedstock resource. Our management believes that we represent a unique one-stop silica quartz supplier to the solar and semiconductor industry, as well as several other sectors requiring a reliable and consistent quality source of high-purity quartz products.
 
There are no identified government approvals required for the products or export restrictions for HPQ products. We have previously successfully exported sample volumes of all products without restriction.
 
Graphene Material.
 
Graphene, a new material, was discovered in 2004 by two UK based Russian university professors who were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2010 for their discovery. Graphene is a 2D material, (one atom thickness) made from graphite/carbon atoms, and whilst still largely unknown to the world is rapidly becoming a new industrial revolution in its own right with more than 8,800 patent applications for graphene and graphene enabled product applications having been filed recently. We have taken an early-stage leading-edge position in this evolving new technological field of graphene enabling and enhancement, specifically to focus upon development of graphene enabled photovoltaic solar panels. Subject to available capital we plan to work with GrapheneCA and other graphene developers to develop a new range of graphene enhanced thin-film solar module associated applications.

Graphene is the world’s thinnest and strongest material ever, with remarkable electrical, thermal and optical properties being the most conductive material ever scientifically measured. A sheet of graphene material is only one single atom in thickness and is referred to as a 2D nano-material having almost no measurable depth, only length and width. Graphene is also highly transparent and can be easily flexed and stretched 25% of its size without breaking. However, it is also 200 times stronger than steel and harder than a diamond. It is said that it would take the weight of an elephant balanced on a needlepoint to break through a single one-atom thick graphene sheet. Graphene material is completely impermeable, even a helium atom (the smallest) cannot pass through graphene. The advent of graphene and the introduction of the extraordinary benefits from combining graphene with existing solar industry materials to thereby create an entirely new range of solar grade materials with dramatically increased attributes and properties not previously believed possible before the advent of graphene is therefore of vital importance to the company.
 
Our main focus remains dedicated to our original premise of developing new leading-edge technologically advanced solar materials and applications, many of which when combined with graphene will ultimately expand the horizons of what is now possible relevant to the generating capacity of solar panels to sensitivity levels not achievable before the invention of graphene. Researchers have already established that the combination of graphene with existing solar materials and solar panel applications can increase the generating efficiency for conventional solar panels from 10%-12% sensitivity in thin-film solar applications, to recently achieved 17% -22% plus.
 
Subject to available funding this combination of existing solar industry materials, and silicon combined with graphene will also greatly benefit our company in ultimately achieving our sales revenues and profitability targets for the benefit of our stockholders.
 
There are thousands of additional unique attributes and properties that make graphene a highly versatile material wit seemingly amazing properties similar to no material other with significant undeveloped potential. The number and variations of possible applications is virtually limitless, including graphene solar panels, graphene super capacitors (game changing graphene batteries that can recharge 5 to 10 times more quickly) than lithium-ion batteries, and cost-effective highly efficient water filtration and purification systems. Researchers have demonstrated graphene-based transistors, flexible networks, quantum dots, spintronic devices, integrated circuits and semiconductor as well as DNA sequencers and drug delivery applications. Adding 1% graphene to plastic makes it electronically conductive.
 
Sales and Marketing Plan.
 
We had substantial pre-existing orders from earlier operations that we were then unable to fulfil because of the lack of adequate volume production facilities. We have continuing enquiries from pre-existing clients and new customers for the immediate supply of high purity quartz sand product as they grow market share in the target high purity and higher value/margin off-take market applications. We believe that our cost-effective and efficient production methods, close proximity to primary offtake markets and major coastal shipping port co-located next to our proposed production facility provide us with significant market advantages over our very few competitors.

High purity products:
 

☐ | Consistent and reliable quality 
--+------------------------------------------------------------
☐ | Abundant prompt supply 
☐ | Easy accessibility to shipping, and short supply lead times
☐ | Regular, consistent and stable reliable supply source. 

 
Australia’s world-renowned politically stable government, combined with the environmentally benign location, makes the company an attractive and secure long-term source of high purity quartz and high purity quartz sand raw materials for manufacturers.
 
We have an extensive customer data base established and ongoing excellent end-user relationships, for the last 13 years since we first commenced operations’ in our original corporate entity in 2007, when we first obtained a US $1 billion supply contract for raw unprocessed quartz materials from Suntech Power of Wuxi China, then the largest producer of photovoltaic solar panels in China.
 
Competitive Advantage.
 
Covia/Unimin, the largest supplier in HPQS, ships its product from their plant in North Carolina. Their product has significant product cost and supply disadvantages compared to that of our company due to an inferior quality raw quartz feedstock with a low purity feldspar base.
 
We believe we are uniquely well positioned and have several important competitive advantages over the other HPQ products main market players: the ability to provide customers with the most cost-effective high purity commercial product, with short lead times for delivery due to the Company’s Townsville location and its access to easy originating freight sources to United States, Asian and European markets.
 
The existing supply chains can involve one or more trading companies who distribute raw or partially beneficiated products into or from the value-added processing chain. We will endeavor as our preferred path to retain the downstream process and direct supply of HPQS products at the closest point to end application manufacturers to maximize the supply chain margins. This will involve a direct to end-user sales model. Within some vertically integrated processing corporations (especially in Japan, China, Korea and Taiwan) supply entry as required via their nominated or preferred company affiliates or trading companies. We have assessed the optimum path between direct and indirect distribution based on the downstream end customers on a regional and market segment basis. A blended sales channel will be adopted. The Chinese market will provide a direct end-user sales model and we expect to maintain local sales office presence in China to drive these off-take markets where early contracts will be available to established customers. Our predecessor company previously operated a sales office in Shanghai for six years, then securing approximately $400 million of HPQS sales orders (over 5 Years).
 
The other key markets in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and S.E. Asia will be addressed through a combination of trading houses aligned with vertically integrated end user corporations or directly, where direct sales access is permitted, and direct distribution cost and margin is justifiable.

We recognize the benefit in initially leveraging the supply relationships of established trading houses with diverse and smaller volume off take customers that may be difficult to service in the short term. This approach will expand the initial potential market reach (especially in categories such as EMC & HP fillers where there is much broader and diverse end user customer base) and expedite sales volumes alongside the direct marketing targets.
 
We continue to build up our off-take customer database and prioritization of the target customers in solar, semiconductor and LCD substrate/quartz glassware. Additional companies in China and Japan have previously received product samples and are targets for purchase of larger production volumes. Expansion of our Australian production facilities will be essential in progressing the next stages of engagement with these new prospects and existing qualified off take customers. The advent of graphene enabled photovoltaic solar materials and our leading position in this as yet undeveloped market segment will also greatly increase our sales and marketing opportunities.
 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts, Including Duration. 
 
Generally speaking, in the HPQ industry patent protections are not standard practice and not usually required or implemented. This is mainly because only a handful of producers worldwide have ever been able to produce commercial grade high purity quartz sand suitable for the high-end electronics and global solar industry. Subsequently the entire world production is less than 150,000 tons in 2020. This is due to two factors: While quartz/silica is the most abundant substance on earth, covering 69% of the earths’ surface, HPQ grade is one of the rarest substances on earth with only a handful of known deposits worldwide. Accordingly, as a strategically important mineral, in some countries, as in Brazil, the government has banned the export of HPQ to maintain sufficient quantities for their own use. In addition, as one of our chief scientists confirms that due to the fact that each deposit of HPQ has its own particular chemical composition and chemical construction, and different manifestations of impurities, there is no single formula or application for producing high purity quartz sand. As with most mineral beneficiation projects, the process used is unique to the mineral resource. No such generic process is available. Considering that industry standards demand impurities measured in the ppm (parts per million) range, maintaining this high level of purity is a complex procedure that would not be secured by the filing of definitive patent applications given the variations in the HPQ raw feedstock material.
Government Product Approvals. 
 
There are no identified government approvals required for our products and no export restrictions for the products. We have previously been involved in successfully exporting sample volumes of all products (with exception of SQ9) without restriction.
 
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the Business.
 
Management believes that there are no identified existing or probable government regulations that will adversely impact our business.
 
Research and Development Activities.
 
Our team members have had dedicated research and development programs since 2005, and from 2009 through 2015 when the company operated its own pilot plant test facility in Melbourne, Australia. The pilot production factory prepared various grades of high purity quartz sand products and supplied sample quantities to customers in Japan, Korea and China. The pilot plant test facility confirmed product feasibility and conformance to required customer standards and validated the business model for building the commercial size and scale full production factory.
 
10


The primary research and development during the next fiscal year will involve further development and evaluation of new efficient processing techniques and applications recently brought about by the development of the new material graphene and the extensive development of new graphene-enabled products. Also, the dramatic complimentary effect the addition of graphene to many existing solar cell production methods and applications will have on the adoption of graphene-based new applications and products that can greatly enhance the generating capacity of existing photovoltaic solar panels with graphene enhancement.
 
Additional research and development resources will be progressively committed to develop new graphene/silica (quartz) and solar grade silicon graphene enabled products and applications to expand and diversify the company product offerings into complimentary solar/semiconductor and energy storage markets.
 
Anticipated Material Acquisition of Plant and Equipment.
 
Subject to availability of capital, we plan to invest $50 million in plant and equipment for establishing commercial volumes of its HPQ products defined above. The plant and equipment investment will scale product throughput capacity for:

☐ | SQ1-SQ5 products to 65,000-250,000+ tonnes per annum; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------
☐ | SQ7 product to 20,000-50,000 tonnes per annum; and 
☐ | SQ9 product commencement of volume supply to 5000+ tonnes over 3 years.

 
The balance of the funding will be applied to future plant and equipment capacity scaling from Year 2 onwards for high purity quartz products and establishing complimentary graphene/silicon/silica enabled product lines.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws.
 
Based upon our long-term experience management believes that the nature of our mining and processing operations does not involve any onerous environmental compliance requirements. Compliance costs have been identified and quantified in the company plan of operations, business plan including financial plan.
Employees.
 
Certain members of our management team have been involved in this industry since 2005 and this has resulted in an experienced team of learned employees, advisors and technical experts in various locations and capacities within both Australia, Central Europe, and in the United States. We have an established eight-year relationship with a local contract miner to minimally process and mine raw quartz into feedstock grade product to fuel the factory production for higher purity products. It is planned to increase fulltime and part time employees/contractors from the present levels to a minimum of 30 within the next 12 months, subject to the company securing additional funding.
 
At the present time we rely upon experienced consultants with whom management has long-term relationships.
 
11


Executive Management and Technical Team.
 
Our executive management and technical team have largely co-worked together since 2005, and especially the last 5 years in Melbourne, Australia, China and the USA with the world’s two leading experts in establishing new refining and processing methods for high-purity silica products. One scientist consultant was directly responsible for the establishment of two of the other three high purity quartz sand factories, and the other scientist was extensively involved in the development of the high purity quartz semiconductor markets, working in the USA and China. They have both co-worked extensively with the company’s technical team in Australia. All of the specialized human resources are available to us. We have secured design and operational assistance commitments with the establishment of the company’s Global Advanced Energies Townsville initiative in Australia from highly experienced China based experts.
 
Collectively our executive management and technical team has worked together for the last 11 years and is extensively experienced in all facets of the high purity silica and solar grade silicon production operations, giving them the skills necessary to operate all sectors of our business operations successfully. We are ready to proceed immediately to the next funding stage to establish a pre-processing factory in Townsville, Queensland, near the high purity silica mine site, that will produce the SQ5 feedstock for processing at the new high purity quartz sand factory.
 
Rights to Minerals
 
The sole rights of Company to its HPQ deposits are via five leases governed by the Queensland Department of National Resources, Mines and Energy (“DNRME”), the authorized State Government body under state and Australian federal legislation.
 
In Australia, mineral resources can be privately owned if no more than ten centimeters below the land surface, with everything below that being owned by the Australian Federal government (AFG). The AFG authorizes each individual state government to manage the business of leasing the mineral resources in its particular state regardless of who owns the land over which the resources lie beneath. The Queensland Government manages these resources on behalf of the state of Queensland. Terms of these leases are subject to the Queensland State Government Resources Acts including the Mineral Resources act 1989 (and amendments) (“MRA”). Mining and exploration rights are issued and managed by the DNRME.
 
Land compensation agreements are in place for all leases. Land compensation fees become payable once leases become operational. Annual total compensation fees for all leases are AU$27,400 per annum, with annual inflation indexed for the duration of the mining lease, which as of September 30, 2020 have not been incurred as these is not yet operational.
 
The lease Native Title arrangements are automatically required to be renegotiated under a “Right to Negotiate “(RTN) process under the Legislation as result of the leaseholder becoming an affiliate of a public company in 2017. This RTN is being progressed accordingly. However, royalties are yet to be finalized under the RTN Process. Lease initial term is 15 years from commencement of grant and operations. Since no grant has yet to be received and the Company has not commenced operations, the actual term of the lease has not begun to run.
 
12


The Company is required to meet all the obligations under the lease conditions; once operational, the following requirements would apply:
 

- | Statutory reporting (quarterly and/or annually) e.g. production, royalty and environmental reporting. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Annual lease fees (currently AU$63.70 per hectare per annum x Total area of leases being 233.38 hectares) = AU$14,229.31 per annum
- | Government royalty fees of AU$0.90c per tonne minerals (quartz) sold/extracted 
- | Annual Department of Environment and Heritage Protection (DEHP) fees approx. AU$800 per annum 
- | Initial security deposit – yet to be adjudicated by DEHP/DNRME 

 
As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the lease is not operational.
