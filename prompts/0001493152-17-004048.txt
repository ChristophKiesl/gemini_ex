Recent Developments
 
Virtual Learning filed a final 14C with the SEC on 2/22/17 changing the name of the company to Dream Homes & Development Corp. in order to more accurately reflect the changing nature and composition of its business operations.
 
During the period from July 1, 2016, thru December 31, 2016, the following improvements and additions were made to the Virtual Company:
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
In an effort to further expand the Company’s revenue potential beyond that of the information field, as detailed in the above paragraphs, Virtual Learning further invested in a non-related business, through associations with several large shareholders in the company. Virtual recognized that the effects of Super Storm Sandy, which occurred on 10/29/12 would be far reaching and cause an almost unlimited demand for construction information, as well as specific construction services. Due to the damage caused by the storm, as well as the material changes in the FEMA flood maps which now require over 30,000 homeowners along the New Jersey coastline to elevate their homes, Virtual felt that acquiring a company in the construction field would create a stable additional revenue stream for the company. Additionally, through its previous associations and long standing professional relationships with Dream Homes Ltd., Virtual felt that Dream Homes educational division was an excellent fit with the existing platform that Virtual has developed to market educational software and materials.
 
As such, Virtual Learning acquired for stock a company known as Dream Building LLC, which will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Virtual Learning and pursue opportunities in the real estate field, specifically in new home construction, home elevations and renovations. As part of this effort, through the end of 2016, Virtual, through its Dream Building subsidiary, acquired the rights to complete 17 single family construction, renovation and home elevation projects in the central NJ region, which it will build to completion. The approximate contract amount of these projects as of December 31, 2016 is $2,438,603.
 
In addition to the above projects, which are in process, Dream Building LLC has also estimated an additional $5,300,000 worth of residential construction projects and added over 200 active prospects to its data base. All of these prospects are prime candidates for educational videos and short books on specific construction and rebuilding topics, as well as candidates for rebuilding projects to be built under the Dream Building LLC division.
 
Management anticipates steady growth in this division of the company, since the rebuilding process will occur over the next 15-20 years, and have a market value of $3,400,000,000. The company anticipates being able to efficiently address 5% - 10% of this market.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
Among other core strengths, we believe that the “Dream Homes Nearly Famous Rebuilding Seminar”, as well as the informational blog known as the “Dream Homes Rebuilding Blog” are several of our key competitive advantages. At this time, there are no other building and development companies which offer these services to the public.
 
Among the other assets that Virtual acquired with Dream Builders LLC, were the rights to operate the educational construction seminar known as “Dream Homes Nearly Famous Rebuilding Seminar”, as well as the informational blog known as the “Dream Homes Rebuilding Blog.”
 
The Nearly Famous Rebuilding Seminar is held bi-monthly, and is a powerful educational tool for homeowners who need of rebuilding or renovations. This seminar has been presented steadily since early 2013, and is designed to educate and assist homeowners in deciphering the confusion about planning and executing complex residential construction projects. A professional team attends each seminar and presents on a diverse variety of topics, including expert advice from some or all of the following attendant at each seminar: architects, engineers, finance people, attorneys, project managers, elevation professionals and builder/general contractors. The seminar has been extremely successful and very helpful to hundreds of people. In addition, the seminar content offers unlimited potential for marketing short educational videos, as well as single topic books regarding many aspects of construction and renovation. The revenue opportunities for this type of educational real estate product will be greatly enhanced by Virtual’s experience and existing software platforms.
 
The “Dream Homes Rebuilding Blog” is an educational platform written by Vincent Simonelli, which offers comprehensive advice on all aspects of construction and real estate.
 
This seminar, as well as the Dream Homes Rebuilding Blog, have been an integral part of the marketing efforts and will continue to be key components in the growth of the educational software and learning material divisions of the company. Currently the blog, which is located at http://blog.dreamhomesltd.com , offers a wide variety of specific knowledge pertaining to construction, development, finance and general real estate matters. Built on a Word Press platform, the Rebuilding Blog is easily searchable by topic and a very useful resource for this demographic. Homeowners who need to build or rebuild are excellent candidates for all manner of educational material. As such, Virtual currently has in development a Nearly Famous Rebuilding after Sandy book, mobile application and numerous single topic publications which specifically explain particular aspects of the rebuilding process.
 
Common topics for short books and videos will include: Foundation Systems, Wall Treatments, Elevating your Home to Allow for a Basement, Adding a Garage, Waterproofing below the Flood Plain, and Cost/Benefit of Various Improvements.
 
As part of the acquisition of a percentage of Dream Homes, Virtual Learning also acquired the rights to all new home builder licensing as well as home improvement contractor registrations, which are currently owned by Dream Homes Ltd., as well as its subsidiary Atlantic Northeast Construction LLC.

Properties & other assets
 
In regard to the category of real estate development, Virtual has acquired a contract for the development and construction of 60 new townhomes in the Ocean County NJ area. This acquisition was made for Virtual stock and occurred in the 4th quarter of 2016. This development project is scheduled to begin in late 2017 or early 2018 and is projected to add approximately $13,000,000 to Virtual’s gross sales, through its Dream Building LLC division.
 
Finance and credit facilities
 
Though growth in the educational software, construction, and renovation divisions of the company has been organic to this point, Virtual has secured a line of credit from a private lender for general working capital. This credit line is structured on an on-demand basis, bears an interest rate of 12% APR charged only for funds in use, and is in the amount of $50,000. Though there are no specific uses for this facility at this time, management anticipates that it will be utilized to further expand various aspects of the company. The lender has indicated willingness to fund future real-estate based investments (such as acquisition of buildable lots, construction of new single family homes and single family home purchases for renovation), on an ongoing basis.
 
Our Products and Services
 
In addition to educational software, the Rebuilding Blog and the Rebuilding Seminar, the Company offers the following range of services and products: engineering & structural design, soil studies, architectural and design/build capabilities, construction management services, general contracting of all residential single and multi-family construction, helical and timber pile installation, masonry foundations and concrete work of all varieties, management of home elevation and moving projects and complete finish requirements for all interior construction. In the construction space, the Company offers a full turn key solution, from plan design through certificate of occupancy.
Marketing, Sales and Subscriber Support
 
One of the Company’s most significant strengths is in social media and digital marketing. Due to the fact that content is being regularly generated through the blog and the seminars, there is a constant stream of new information that is being placed on Facebook, Twitter, the Rebuilding Blog and other media channels. The Company’s Dream Building subsidiary is regularly ranked on the first page in Google searches and is a strong source of new inquiries and recurring business. The Company’s web site can be found at www.dreamhomesltd.com and the blog at http://blog.dreamhomesltd.com .
Concentrations
 
Currently the concentrations of the Company’s operations fall into 3 broad categories, as follows: Educational software, video and other materials, new construction & development, and renovation/elevation work. It is anticipated that the latter 2 categories will continue to comprise 95% of the Company’s revenue & earnings.

Our Markets
 
The Company seeks to become a fully integrated real estate company specializing in the elevation and moving of homes, development and sale of approved and improved land, and construction of townhouses, single-family homes and various residential properties located throughout southern New Jersey. Our principal real estate operations are currently conducted in the central & southern part of the State of New Jersey, although it is our intention to expand into additional markets based on market demand. It is our observation that the fundamental value of the land in southern New Jersey, particularly areas affected by Storm Sandy and represented by Ocean, Monmouth, Atlantic, Cape May, is currently at pricing levels which have not been seen in New Jersey for 10 – 15 years.
 
Because of the reduction in land values in New Jersey to levels that we feel represent attractive investment opportunities, we have the opportunity to offer homes at more competitive and affordable pricing levels. Our ability to offer elevation management, complete renovation, demolition and new construction and full architectural and engineering services gives us the ability to offer all clients a full range of services.
 
Our initial investment goal is to evaluate each property to determine the best path to take in order to maximize potential return for that particular property. With new construction, our intention is to purchase either fully improved or at least fully approved properties. Fully approved properties includes those having all the entitlements and permits in hand, and as needed, to post performance guarantees and/or file subdivision maps, and/or proceed with infrastructure construction, such as utilities, roads and other site improvements. With new construction, we have adopted this business model to help reduce our exposure to the many risks and costs associated with land development.
 
From time to time, and as we come across an outstanding investment opportunity in land development priced at a level that justifies the inherent risks and costs associated with land development, the Company may contract for, and will bring through the approval process, various types of raw land. The Company will continue to allocate capital in the pursuit of approvals, since the risk/reward of developmental activity is so great. It should be noted that we do not generally take ownership of the property until the approval process has been completed, but rather control the property through contracts and options. In these instances, if we should fail to obtain approvals for any reason, whether through unsuitability, change of zoning or other factors, our loss shall be limited to the money expended for the approvals to that date. Our planned business model includes the acquisition, construction, and sale of a variety of residential properties, including construction of entry-level and first time move-up single-family and multi-family homes.

In addition to offering traditional stick frame construction of our homes, we may also offer modular and manufactured homes, townhomes and condominiums.
 
In our opinion, the most effective business model for residential development and construction is to target the largest current and future segment of the home buying market, which appears to be primarily first-time and move-up purchasers, as well as those homeowners forced to move or relocate due to Storm Sandy, another storm related event, or obsolescence of their existing property. According to Zillow (http//www.zillow.com/local-info/NJ-hjome-value/r40/), the optimum size and price range for a starter or first time- move up single family home is 1600 – 2000 square feet and $180,000 - $230,000. Townhomes and condominium preferred size and price range is 1400 – 1800 square feet and $170,000 - $220,000.
 
In our opinion, the southern New Jersey real estate market represents one of the most attractive real estate investment opportunities, with the greatest opportunity for future appreciation being concentrated in Ocean, Atlantic, Cape May, Monmouth and Middlesex counties. These areas primarily fall within 1-hour driving time, and serve as “bedroom” communities for, the Atlantic City, New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. In our opinion, the residential housing demand in this area, particularly in the market segments which we intend to address, enjoys a fundamental support level, based on several factors. These factors include excellent air, rail and road infrastructure, Atlantic City casino and support services, tourism, and a central location between Philadelphia and New York. Additionally, there has been a chronic affordable housing shortage throughout New Jersey and all indication are that condition will continue fot the foreseeable future. This situation plays well into the Company’s strengths, which are focused on entry level or first time move up housing, as well as elevations and renovations of existing damaged homes. Finally, all of these market areas have tremendous growth potential due to the effects of Storm Sandy on the available housing supply.
 
In addition, historically and according to the NJ Housing Affordability Index (http://www.yourhousefast.com/housing-affor-index.asp) which is currently 126, home ownership is more affordable than renting. In this case, the index being above 100 signifies that a family earning the median income has 26% more income than is necessary to qualify for a mortgage loan on a median-priced home, and therefore housing prices in these areas offer much better value than comparable properties in the North Jersey, New York and Philadelphia areas.
 
Nationwide, affordability is at an all-time high. According to the National Association of Home Builders, the Housing Opportunity Index (HOI) is at a record level, with 75.9% of all new and existing homes sold in the fourth quarter of 2011 considered to be affordable to families earning the national median income of $64,200. See http://www.nahb.org/news_details.aspx?sectionID-135&newsID-15036 for more detail.
 
Zillow and the NJ Housing Affordability Index are publicly available at the web citations noted above, are constantly updated, and the Company’s management believes them to be accurate and reliable.
