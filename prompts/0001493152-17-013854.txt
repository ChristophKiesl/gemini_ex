Our Business and Corporate History
 
VISIBER57 CORP. (the “Company”) formerly eBizware, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed on December 31, 2013. The Company is headquartered at Unit B19, 9/F, Efficiency House, 35 Tai Yau Street, San Po Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The Company was formed to continue the development and distribution of a software solution that provides visual online data resource for our customers to integrate with third party implementations.
 
On August 12, 2016, in connection with the sale of a controlling interest in the Company, Mark W. DeFoor (the “Seller”), the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Director entered into and closed on that certain Share Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with 57 Society International Limited, (“57 Society”), a Hong Kong company, whereby 57 Society purchased from the Seller a total of 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Shares”) for an aggregate price of $321,000. The Shares acquired represented approximately 94.70% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.

On August 12, 2016, the Company discontinued its historical business and commenced exploration of its new business opportunities by way of developing and launching a mobile device application (APP) that encourages community building centered around the use of a cloud-based APP. The concept for development of this APP surrounds the use of “Numbers 1-9” where products are expected to be customizable according to individual color preferences and suitable number combinations. The Company may also seek businesses to acquire.
