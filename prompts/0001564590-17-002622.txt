Item 1: | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 US Foods Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to here as “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” or “US Foods.” US Foods conducts all of its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary US Foods, Inc. (“USF”). US Foods is controlled by investment funds associated with or designated by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”) and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., L.P. (“KKR”). KKR and CD&R are collectively referred to herein as the “Sponsors”.
 Our Company
 We are among America’s great food companies and one of only two foodservice distributors with a national footprint in the United States. Built through organic growth and acquisitions, we trace our roots back over 150 years to a number of heritage companies with rich legacies in food innovation and customer service. These include Monarch Foods (established in 1853), Sexton (1883), PYA (1903), Rykoff (1911) and Kraft Foodservice (1976). US Foodservice was organized as a corporation in Delaware in 1989. In 2007, the Sponsors acquired US Foodservice from Royal Ahold N.V. In November 2011, we rebranded from “US Foodservice” to “US Foods.” 
 The U.S. foodservice distribution industry is large, fragmented and growing, with total industry sales of approximately $280 billion in 2016 according to Technomic (February 2017), a third party source for food and foodservice industry data, intelligence and commentary. With net sales of $23 billion in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we are the second largest foodservice distributor in the United States with a 2016 market share of approximately 8%.
 Our mission is to be First In Food. We strive to inspire and empower chefs and foodservice operators to bring great food experiences to consumers. This mission is supported by our strategy of Great Food. Made Easy. It centers on providing a broad and innovative offering of high-quality products to our customers, as well as a comprehensive suite of industry-leading e-commerce, technology, and business solutions. We operate as one business with standardized business processes, shared systems infrastructure, and an organizational model that optimizes national scale with local execution, allowing us to manage the business as a single operating segment. We have centralized activities where scale matters and our local field structure focuses on customer facing activities. As we say on our trucks, we are Keeping Kitchens Cooking across America.
 
We supply approximately 250,000 customer locations nationwide. They include independently owned single and multi-unit restaurants, regional restaurant concepts, national restaurant chains, hospitals, nursing homes, hotels and motels, country clubs, government and military organizations, colleges and universities, and retail locations. We provide approximately 400,000 fresh, frozen, and dry food stock-keeping units, or SKUs, as well as non-food items, sourced from over 5,000 suppliers. Our more than 4,000 sales associates manage customer relationships at local, regional, and national levels. They are supported by sophisticated marketing and category management capabilities, as well as a sales support team that includes world-class chefs and restaurant operations consultants. Our extensive network of 60 distribution centers and a fleet of approximately 6,000 trucks provide an efficient operating model, allowing us to offer high levels of customer service. This operating model allows us to leverage our nationwide scale and footprint while executing locally.

Our Business Strategy
 While we serve all customer types, our strategy focuses on independent restaurants, small chains and regional chains, and healthcare and hospitality customers. Their expected growth, mix of product and category purchases, adoption of value-added solutions, and other factors make them attractive to us.
 We offer innovative products and services that help chefs and operators succeed. Our e-commerce tools and mobile solutions make it easier for customers to do business with us. We execute on these elements of our strategy while delivering on the fundamental requirements that are important to all of our customers. This strategy is supported by a series of capabilities and initiatives depicted in the following pyramid.
 
Great Food. Made Easy.
 Strategic Priorities and Supporting Initiatives
 

 
• | “Great Food.” Food leadership means meeting the needs of a diverse and growing customer base and providing a broad product portfolio. This offering includes items from leading manufacturers’ brands and our private brands. Our unique product innovation capabilities keep us at the forefront of emerging food trends. We work with suppliers to bring new items to market that reflect consumer preferences such as sustainable products. Great Food is especially important to our core independent and regional restaurant customers who value food quality, menu diversity, and insights into emerging trends in consumer preferences. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | “Made Easy.” To improve the customer experience, we provide the broadest and most relevant e-commerce and business support tools in the U.S. foodservice distribution industry. We combine this with a consultative selling approach to create data-driven customer insights that focus our efforts on the most impactful areas from a customer’s perspective. Our mobile and e-commerce capabilities allow customers to easily place orders, track shipments, view product information, and verify orders at delivery. Our knowledge of consumer trends and innovative food offerings, coupled with a deep understanding of our customers’ operations, allows us to bring them opportunities for growth and efficiency. We are also expanding our capabilities with analytical tools that yield additional insights from our transactional and operational data.

• | Flawless Fundamentals. We strive to do everything right with our customers every day: from ordering to delivery to billing. Our customers value product quality, food safety, product price, and variety, as well as dependable and accurate transactions and delivery. We outperform most of our competitors in many of these areas, as evidenced by the result of customer surveys. We are always looking for ways to improve this experience, to further strengthen our customer relationships and widen the performance gap between us and our competitors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Foundational Excellence. We focus on people, processes, infrastructure, and insights from analytics. This begins with a commitment to our approximately 25,000 employees: developing their talents and maintaining a strong and vibrant culture. We have significant scale in our operating network, coupled with leading supply chain management capabilities and standardized business processes. This includes a common technology infrastructure supporting transactional, operating, and financial activities. The result is a streamlined organizational model that supports local leadership with centralized capabilities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since December 2015, we have acquired three broadline foodservice distributors, which had a combined total of more than $246 million in sales, primarily to independent restaurants. In December 2015, we acquired Dierks Waukesha (“Dierks”), in Waukesha, Wisconsin. With annual sales of approximately $120 million and more than 3,500 customers, Dierks was one of the largest regional broadline foodservice distributors in the four-state area it serviced. In March 2016, we acquired Cara Donna Provision Co. (“Cara Donna”). With annual sales of approximately $100 million and more than 1,300 customers, Cara Donna is one of the largest regional broadline foodservice distributors in New England. In October 2016, we acquired Jeraci Foods (“Jeraci”), which had annual sales of approximately $26 million. Jeraci is a distributor focused on the Italian specialty portion of the market, that will augment our presence in the Italian restaurant and pizzeria area.
 In addition to the broadline acquisitions, we have acquired two specialty producers to enhance our capability in produce and seafood markets. In June 2016, we acquired Freshway Foods (“Freshway”) in Sidney, Ohio. Freshway has annual sales of approximately $130 million and is a produce processor that provides bulk, re-pack, and value-added processed produce to foodservice and retail customers. In October 2016, we acquired Save On Seafood, which has annual sales of approximately $80 million and is a seafood processor in St. Petersburg, Florida. This acquisition enables us to further our penetration in the center of the plate product category.
 Because the U.S. foodservice distribution industry is fragmented, we believe there are plenty of attractive acquisition opportunities for us that will allow us to grow with our target customer types and generate an attractive return on investment from the revenue and cost synergies we hope to capture from integrating the acquired businesses into our operations.
 Our Industry
 
The U.S. foodservice distribution industry is highly fragmented, with over 15,000 local and regional competitors. Foodservice distributors typically fall into three categories representing differences in customer focus, product offering, and supply chain:

• | Broadline distributors who offer a “broad line” of products and services
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | System distributors who carry products specified for large chains
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Specialized distributors focused on specific product categories or customer types (e.g., meat or produce)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A number of adjacent competitors also serve the U.S. foodservice distribution industry, including cash-and-carry retailers, commercial wholesale outlets and warehouse clubs, commercial website outlets, and grocery stores. 
 3


There is a high degree of customer overlap, particularly across the broadline, specialized and cash-and-carry categories, as many customers purchase from multiple distributors concurrently. Most buying decisions are based on the type of product, its quality and price, plus a distributor’s ability to completely and accurately fill orders and provide timely deliveries. Since switching costs are low, customers can make supplier and channel changes quickly. Existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances, and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers. Given our mix of products and services, we consider ourselves as a broadline distributor.
The U.S. foodservice distribution industry is comprised of different customer types of varying sizes, growth profiles, and product and service requirements. Industry sales data reflected below for 2016 is based on information from Technomic (February 2017). 
  
• | Independent restaurants/small chains and regional chains. U.S. foodservice distribution sales to independent restaurants and small chains were estimated to be $67 billion in 2016. Regional chains were estimated to represent $16 billion in foodservice distribution sales in 2016. Independent restaurants and small chains typically differentiate themselves in the market on the dining experience they provide to consumers and on the quality and diversity of their menu. They value business solutions that help them attract diners, improve the effectiveness of their menu offering, and drive efficiency in their operations. We believe there are significant opportunities to provide additional solutions to these customers that would be otherwise difficult for them to access, given their more limited size and resources. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Healthcare customers. Healthcare customers were estimated to comprise $14 billion in foodservice distribution sales in 2016. These customers generally fall into either acute care (e.g., hospital systems) or senior living (e.g., nursing homes and long-term care facilities). Healthcare customers have complex foodservice needs given their scale, need for menu diversity, and logistics considerations. Food is also not as central to their overall business as it is for a restaurant, but it is a key contributor to patient satisfaction. As a result, some healthcare providers utilize third-party contract management companies to operate their foodservice facilities. Many use group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, as intermediaries in order to gain procurement scale. In our experience, healthcare customers purchasing directly, through GPOs, or through contract foodservice operators value strong relationships with their foodservice partners, particularly those that bring national scale, a broad product offering, and strong transactional and logistics capabilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hospitality customers. This customer type was estimated to represent $19 billion in foodservice distribution sales in 2016. They are a diverse group, ranging from large hotel chains and conference centers to local banquet halls, country clubs, casinos, and entertainment and sports complexes. Food is a key contributor to guest satisfaction for these customers, and they value solutions related to menu planning and efficiency improvements in their kitchens and restaurants. With complex foodservice needs, hospitality customers value streamlined purchasing processes and expect high service levels in fulfilling their orders. Hospitality customers also use GPOs as intermediaries in order to gain procurement scale.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National restaurant chains. The top 100 national restaurant chains were estimated to generate $77 billion in U.S. foodservice distribution industry sales in 2016. These customers tend to in-source most activities except distribution, where they often rely on system distributors primarily for freight and logistics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In fiscal 2016, no single customer represented more than 4% of our total customer sales. Sales to our top 50 customers/GPOs represented approximately 43% of our net sales in fiscal 2016.  We have relationships with GPOs that act as agents for their members in negotiating pricing, delivery and other terms. Some customers who are members of GPOs purchase their products directly from us under the terms negotiated by their GPOs. In fiscal 2016, this accounted for about 25% of our total customer purchases. GPOs primarily focus on healthcare, hospitality, education, government/military and restaurant chains.

We believe that a broad array of value-added solutions offered by foodservice distributors makes customers more effective and efficient and can help foodservice distributors profitably grow their businesses. These services require distributors to invest in their capabilities, resulting in a higher cost-to-serve. When customers benefit from product and service solutions, they purchase a more attractive and profitable mix of items and tend to have stronger commercial relationships and loyalty.
 We believe that the customer types that we target, which include independent restaurants, small and regional chains, and healthcare and hospitality customers, have greater growth prospects and/or benefit from value-added solutions to a greater extent than other customer types. 
 There are several important dynamics affecting the industry.
  
• | Evolving consumer tastes and preferences. Consumers demand healthy and authentic food alternatives with fewer artificial ingredients, and they value locally harvested and sustainably manufactured products. In addition, many ethnic food offerings are becoming more mainstream as consumers show a greater willingness to try new flavors and cuisines. Changes in consumer preferences create opportunities for new and innovative products and for unique food-away-from-home destinations. This, in turn, is expected to create growth, margin expansion, and better customer retention opportunities for those distributors with the flexibility to balance national scale and local preferences. We believe foodservice distributors will likely need broader product assortments, extended supplier networks, effective supply chain management capabilities, and strong food safety programs to meet these needs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Generational shifts with millennials and baby boomers. Given their purchasing power, millennials and baby boomers will continue to significantly influence food consumption and the food-away-from-home market. According to a U.S. Census Bureau survey, there are 83 million individuals born between 1982 and 2000 in the United States. That makes these millennials the largest demographic cohort. They are key to driving growth in the broader U.S. food industry as their disposable income increases. Baby boomers continue to shape the industry as they remain in the workplace longer, prolonging their contribution to food-away-from-home expenditures.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growing importance of e-commerce. We see significant future growth in e-commerce and in the adoption of mobile technology solutions by foodservice operators. E-commerce solutions increase customer retention. They also deepen the relationship between foodservice distributors and customers, creating new insights and services that can make both more efficient. We think deeper, technology-enabled relationships with customers will accelerate the adoption of new products and increase customer loyalty. As a result, distributors that have invested in creating these capabilities will have a competitive edge. We believe this trend will accelerate, as millennials become key influencers and decision-makers within the industry, particularly at the customer level. We believe foodservice distributors will need to strengthen technology, data analytics, and related capabilities to address these changes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we have the scale, foresight and agility required to proactively address these trends and, in turn, benefit from higher growth, greater customer retention and improved profitability.
 
Products, Brands, and Other Intellectual Property
 We have a broad assortment of categories and brands to meet customers’ needs. In many categories, we offer products under our own private brands and trademarks.

We have also registered or applied for trademark protection in the United States in connection with our brand portfolio: for our Best tier lines: Chef’s Line, Rykoff Sexton, Stock Yards and Metro Deli; for our Better tier products: Monarch, Monogram, Molly’s Kitchen and Glenview Farms, among others; and for our Good tier offerings: Valu+Plus and Harvest Value.
 Other than the US Foods trademark, and the trademarks for our brand portfolio, we do not believe that trademarks, patents, or copyrights are material to our business.
 Suppliers
 We purchase from over 5,000 individual suppliers, none of which accounted for more than 5% of our aggregate purchases in fiscal 2016. Our suppliers generally are large corporations selling national brand name and private brand products. Additionally, regional suppliers support targeted geographic initiatives, and private label programs requiring regional distribution. We generally negotiate supplier agreements on a centralized basis.
Seasonality
 Our business does not fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and as a result, is not considered seasonal. 
 Working Capital
 Our operations and strategic objectives require continuing capital investment, and our resources include cash provided by operations, as well as access to capital from bank borrowings, various types of debt and other financing arrangements.  See discussion in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding our liquidity and capital resources.  
Government Regulation
 As a marketer, processor and distributor of food products in the United States, US Foods must comply with various laws and regulations from federal, state and local regulatory agencies. Our policy is to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. A summary of certain laws and regulations is described below.
Food Holding and Processing
 We are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; the Bioterrorism Act; and regulations created by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The FDA regulates manufacturing and holding requirements for foods, specifies the standards of identity for certain foods and prescribes the format and content of certain information that must appear on food product labels.

The recently published applicable rules under the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”) significantly expanded our food safety requirements. Among other things, we are required to maintain comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain that are both verified and validated. The FSMA further regulates food products imported into the United States and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority. The Act’s rule on the sanitary transportation of food may require us to enhance our systems to ensure that we meet new standards for maintaining the safety of food during transportation.
 For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Country of Origin Labeling Act, and regulations from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”). The USDA imposes standards for product quality and sanitation, including the inspection and labeling of meat and poultry products, and the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our vendors.
 Our Company and products are also subject to state and local regulation. This includes measures such as the licensing of our facilities, enforcement of standards for our products and facilities by state and local health agencies, and regulation of our trade practices in connection with selling products.
 Our processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections. Our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal and/or state authorities. We have a small number of manufacturing facilities for some meat, poultry, seafood and produce products.  These units are appropriately registered and inspected by USDA and FDA respectively.  We also must establish communication programs to transmit information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute.
 Our customers include several departments of the federal government, including the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, as well as certain state and local entities. These customer relationships subject us to additional regulations applicable to government contractors.
 Trade
 For the purchase of products manufactured outside of the United States, and for the shipment of products to customers located outside of the United States, we are subject to customs laws regarding the import and export of shipments. Our activities, including working with customs brokers and freight forwarders, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of Homeland Security.
Anticorruption
 Because we are organized under the laws of a state in the U.S. and our principal place of business is in the U.S., we are considered a “domestic concern” under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and are covered by the anti-bribery provisions of the Act. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit any domestic concern and any officer, director, employee, or agent, acting on behalf of the domestic concern from paying or authorizing payment of anything of value to (i) influence any act or decision by a foreign official; (ii) induce a foreign official to do or omit to do any act in violation of his/her lawful duty; (iii) secure any improper advantage; or (iv) induce a foreign official to use his/her influence to assist the payor in obtaining or retaining business, or directing business to another person.
Ground Transportation
 The U.S. Department of Transportation and its agencies, the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regulate our trucking operations through the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of service. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under federal and state regulations.
 7


Environmental
 Our operations are also subject to a broad range of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. Our operations are also subject to zoning and building regulations. The environmental laws and regulations cover a variety of procedures, including appropriately managing wastewater and stormwater; complying with clean air laws, including those governing vehicle emissions; properly handling and disposing of solid and hazardous wastes; protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases; and monitoring and maintaining underground and aboveground storage tanks for diesel fuel and other petroleum products.
 A number of our facilities have ammonia or Freon-based refrigeration systems, which could cause injury or environmental damage if accidently released. In addition, many of our facilities have propane and battery powered forklifts. Proposed or recently enacted legal requirements, such as those requiring the phase-out of certain ozone-depleting substances, and proposals for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, may require us to upgrade or replace equipment, or may increase our transportation or other operating costs.
 Employment
 The U.S. Department of Labor and its agencies, the Employee Benefits Security Administration, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs regulate our employment practices and standards for workers. We are also subject to laws that prohibit discrimination in employment based on non-merit categories, including Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other laws relating to accessibility and the removal of barriers. Our workers’ compensation self-insurance is subject to regulation by the jurisdictions in which we operate.
 Our facilities are subject to inspections under the Occupational Safety and Health Act to ensure our compliance with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. US Foods is also subject to the National Labor Relations Act, which governs the process for collective bargaining between employers and employees and protects the rights of both employers and employees in the workplace.
 Compliance
 We believe that we comply with the regulatory requirements relating to our operations. Failing to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in a number of adverse situations. These could include administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or fines; mandatory or voluntary product recalls; warning or untitled letters; cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance; closing facilities or operations; the loss, revocation, or modification of any existing licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals; and the failure to get additional licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These laws and regulations may change in the future, and we may incur material costs to comply with them, or any required product recalls.
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 25,000 employees, of which approximately 4,500 are members of local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and other labor organizations. Approximately one-third of our facilities have employees represented by unions with collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”). 
 During fiscal year 2016, 13 CBAs covering approximately 1,400 employees were renegotiated. During fiscal 2017, nine CBAs covering approximately 800 employees are subject to renegotiation. While we have experienced work stoppages in the past, we believe we have generally good relations with both union and non-union employees, and we believe we are well-regarded in the communities in which we operate.
