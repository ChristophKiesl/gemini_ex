 Overview
We are a leading provider of vertically tailored customer engagement software and integrated payments solutions. At EngageSmart, our mission is to simplify customer and client engagement to allow our customers to focus resources on initiatives that improve their businesses and better serve their communities. We offer single instance, multi-tenant, true Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) vertical solutions that are designed to simplify our customers’ engagement with their clients by driving digital adoption and self-service. As of December 31, 2022, EngageSmart serves approximately 99,300 customers in the SMB Solutions segment and approximately 3,300 customers in the Enterprise Solutions segment across several core verticals: Health & Wellness, Government, Utilities, Financial Services, Healthcare and Giving. Our SaaS solutions are purpose-built for each of our verticals and they simplify and automate mission-critical workflows such as scheduling, client onboarding, client communication, paperless billing, and electronic payment processing. Our solutions transform our customers’ digital engagement and empower them to manage, improve, and grow their businesses.
We believe the markets we serve are burdened by legacy systems and processes that result in operational inefficiencies and relatively low digital adoption from consumers. At the same time, consumers increasingly demand the convenient self-service capabilities and intuitive, frictionless, and personalized digital experiences that have become commonplace in other industries. Existing solutions are often built on legacy, hosted, or on-premises infrastructure that can lack the flexibility, scalability, and integrations required to provide advanced digital engagement capabilities. This has created a tremendous opportunity for our solutions to improve the customer experience by either replacing or augmenting the information systems used by our customers. We believe our ability to leverage our true SaaS solutions to innovate quickly and deliver enhancements to our customers on an ongoing basis is a key competitive advantage that increases digital adoption and adds value for our clients.
We believe our solutions address a massive market opportunity today. Our verticals are large, underpenetrated, and generally non-cyclical with significant whitespace, low digital adoption, and growing usage of software and payments. Many verticals are only just beginning their digital journeys, providing an attractive runway for growth.
Our Solutions
 We organize our solutions into two reportable segments, Enterprise Solutions and SMB Solutions. The Enterprise Solutions segment is primarily engaged in providing SaaS solutions that simplify customer-client engagement through electronic billing and digital payments. The SMB Solutions segment is primarily engaged in providing end-to-end practice management solutions geared toward the Health & Wellness industry. Our value proposition is focused on transforming our customers’ digital engagement through four core SaaS solutions, including:
    •SimplePractice. An end-to-end practice management and electronic health record ("EHR") platform that health and wellness professionals use to manage their practices. SimplePractice serves practitioners, who are our customers, 


throughout their career journey, allowing them to manage their practice development from licensure to private practice. SimplePractice enables customers to engage with their clients across both virtual and in-person settings, schedule appointments, document cases, and handle all aspects of billing and payment processing, as well as insurance claim processing on one integrated platform. Our platform also helps our customers build and grow their practices through the use of our online marketplace.
 •InvoiceCloud. An electronic bill presentment and payment solution that helps our Government, Utility, and Financial Services customers digitize billing, client communications, and collections. We believe InvoiceCloud drives superior client digital adoption, which increases engagement and drives operational efficiency for our customers. 
 •HealthPay24. A patient engagement and payment platform that helps health systems, physician groups, dental practices, and medical billers efficiently drive patient self-pay collections.
 •DonorDrive. A fundraising software platform that helps non-profits, healthcare organizations, and higher education institutions produce virtual events, launch branded donation campaigns, and create peer-to-peer fundraising experiences.
 Our success in helping our customers simplify, streamline, and grow their businesses has allowed us to achieve significant growth. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated revenue of $303.9 million and $216.3 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had net income of $20.6 million and a net loss of $9.0 million, respectively. Our Adjusted EBITDA was $49.3 million and $30.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").
Our Competitive Advantage
 We believe we have a differentiated position in the market, built on the following strengths:
•True SaaS solutions. We offer true SaaS solutions that simplify customer engagement by driving digital adoption and self-service capabilities. By “true” SaaS, we mean our products are single instance, multi-tenant cloud software solutions. They were designed to operate in the cloud from the beginning, which provides us the flexibility, scalability, and integrations required to deliver advanced digital engagement capabilities. We believe our architecture enables us to innovate quickly and deliver new features to our customers simultaneously and at lower operating costs compared to legacy providers. Our ability to innovate quickly is critical to maintaining our product leadership. Our true SaaS architecture also provides financial benefits to us through operational scalability. 
 •Product leadership through continuous innovation. We strive to deliver the best software solutions in the verticals we target and to continue innovating around these products to maintain this product leadership. For example, in our SMB Solutions segment, SimplePractice offered integrated telehealth capabilities well before the COVID-19 pandemic, and SimplePractice continues to introduce additional features for our customers to grow their practices, such as managed billing, enhanced group practice workflows to support multiple practitioners, and an online marketplace that reinvents how practitioners connect with therapy seekers; through both a direct connection as well as through employee assistance programs and employer-sponsored health plans. In our Enterprise Solutions segment, InvoiceCloud continues to introduce new features, such as support for alternative payment methods and enhancements to our customer and payer portals. Our true SaaS model allows our customers to benefit from this innovation on release without the cost or time delays of traditional software upgrades. 
 •Vertical domain expertise. We are focused on providing vertically tailored customer engagement software and integrated payments to our customers. We develop deep expertise in the industries we serve and recruit industry experts with vertical domain expertise to drive innovation and product development. Our approach enables us to deliver industry-tailored software solutions, including business management software, customer engagement applications, and billing and payment solutions, to address vertical-specific workflows and customer requirements. Our vertical domain expertise is a competitive differentiator when we compete against “one size fits all” solutions offered by other providers. 
 •Exceptional talent and culture. We believe our unique culture enables us to attract, retain, and develop exceptional talent, which is a critical component of our success. Our culture is deeply embedded in everything we do and is centered on two core principles: a growth mindset and servant leadership. We believe the best leaders empower their teams to excel, and great companies provide the tools their customers need to win in the marketplace. 


•Customer focus. We have a product-driven, customer-focused ethos, and we are dedicated to helping our customers simplify, streamline, and grow their businesses. We win when our customers win. For example, in our Enterprise Solutions segment, the core value proposition of InvoiceCloud is to drive digital adoption, which makes it easy for our customers to connect digitally with their clients, and for these clients to adopt paperless billing and electronic payment methods. Because we monetize InvoiceCloud on a transaction basis, everyone wins when we are successful in driving digital adoption. 
 •Effective go-to-market. We have an efficient and diversified go-to-market strategy tailored to each vertical we serve. For our SMB Solutions segment, we primarily generate inbound interest for SimplePractice through search engine optimization, word-of-mouth, paid customer referrals, and search engine marketing. For our Enterprise Solutions segment, we typically integrate our solutions with our customers’ back-end core systems, and we go-to-market with a partner-assisted direct sales force, which accelerates new customer acquisition and increases retention. 
 Our Growth Strategies
We are focused on growing and scaling our business in a rapid yet sustainable and disciplined fashion. We intend to drive growth by executing the following key strategies:
•Grow with existing customers. We grow with our existing customers in two ways: adding product features and additional functionality to our solutions and continuing to drive digital adoption of our existing solutions. With SimplePractice, we have a successful track record of building a complete ecosystem for health and wellness practitioners that extends beyond practice management to self-pay and insurance payments, professional websites, continuing education, digital content, and marketplace solutions. Our platform has been tailored to enable practices to grow by seamlessly adding practitioners. With InvoiceCloud, driving digital adoption enables us to capture more electronic bill payments and generate more transaction and usage-based revenue. Our ability to grow with and create value for our existing customers underpins our 117% and 119% dollar-based net retention rate as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 •Win new customers. Our verticals are large, underpenetrated, and non-cyclical with significant whitespace, low digital adoption, and growing usage of software and payments. We believe there is a significant opportunity to attract new customers with our current offerings in our vertical end-markets. We plan to continue winning new customers by investing in our sales force, digital marketing campaigns, improving the awareness of our brands and solutions, and building new partnerships and integrations. We intend to continue winning market share by driving product leadership and best-in-class digital adoption of our solutions. 
 •Build new, and enhance existing, products. In order to maintain our product leadership, we continue to invest in new products and develop the tools and features that customers need to win in the marketplace. We actively solicit our customers’ feedback in order to build products that best fit their business needs. These insights enable us to continually assess opportunities to develop or enhance our products to further expand market share, drive customer retention, and fuel growth for our business. 
 •Expand into new verticals. Many verticals are only just beginning their digital journeys, which provides a tremendous runway for growth. We intend to continue to expand into new verticals and sub verticals over time, and we are particularly attracted to verticals with low digital adoption and growing usage of software and payments. For example, the SimplePractice platform was originally built to meet the needs of mental health practitioners. Over time, we have tailored the platform to address specialties within mental health and expanded the platform to serve other health and wellness professionals such as speech language pathologists, occupational therapists, and dieticians, among others. 
 •Pursue select strategic acquisitions. We plan to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will be complementary to our existing verticals and solutions and increase the value proposition we deliver to our customers. For example, we may pursue acquisitions that we believe will help us expand within existing or new industry verticals or enter new markets. 
Our Technology and Architecture
Our solutions are architected and built on a common set of foundational technology principles that distinguish us and provide a multitude of benefits to our customers. Our solutions are designed from the ground up for speed-to-market, scalability, security, durability, and reliability. The foundational technology that enables these benefits includes:
•True SaaS. SaaS is a licensing and delivery model that offers customers all of the benefits of an application without requiring continuous software upkeep by in-house staff or third parties. SaaS applications deliver the most up-to-date software through the Internet to a computer or mobile device. To be considered a true SaaS platform, all features, functionality, automation, security controls, data storage, and configuration must be delivered from a single code base on a multi-tenant infrastructure. All customers get the latest updates simultaneously and at more frequent intervals from a single platform. 
 Our solutions employ micro-services, containerization, and other modern architectural concepts that provide support for zero-downtime deployments, reduced testing complexity, pipeline and delivery automation, continuous delivery, and security by design. And we are always investing in emerging technologies that will help to improve our customers’ experiences.
•Configure not customize. Scaling to serve thousands of customers with unique engagement needs and business requirements demands substantial forethought and engineering. Surrendering to serve customers by customizing software is a costly and limiting strategy. We have invested tens of thousands of hours of engineering effort to adhere to the principles of exposing capabilities through configuration of our SaaS solutions, making them available to all customers with the “flip of a switch” without compromising speed, security, or upgradability. New customers can onboard quickly without prolonged implementations and all customers can embrace new capabilities at their own pace. Our solutions are designed to avoid legacy dead ends or big-bang deployment risk associated with customizations. 
 Customers can configure their experience by opting into the features or services they need or want in many cases on their own, or if they choose, with assistance. No custom coding is necessary to take advantage of our SaaS platform capabilities.
•Extend capabilities through integrations. Our solutions embrace the power of partnerships through integration. Some of our customers have other technology and systems that serve as the core software systems and deliver or receive data about their clients. We have implemented customer and vendor-facing APIs, web service endpoints, and other integrations with many core software system providers and vendors. The architecture of the integrations and the design patterns we employ help us quickly extend our integrations to new providers or vendors. 
Sales, Marketing and Customer Success
 Sales and Marketing
 We employ a diversified and efficient go-to-market strategy that leverages digital marketing, direct sales, referrals, and strategic partnerships to accelerate new customer acquisition.
 In our SMB Solutions segment, we primarily generate inbound interest through search engine optimization, word-of-mouth, paid customer referral arrangements, and search engine marketing. We employ a self-service model. Most customers navigate to our website and adopt our solution without ever speaking with a SimplePractice employee.
 In our Enterprise Solutions segment, we integrate directly with our customers’ back-end core systems, and we go to market with a direct sales force, sometimes in conjunction with strategic partners, such as back-end software providers. We leverage partners for lead generation and selling support, and we have over 300 unique integrations to customer billing and client management systems. Our partnerships provide us greater reach into vertical markets with pre-qualified leads that drive highly efficient sales processes. Through our strategic partnerships, we enjoy a shorter sales cycle, which enables our sales team to spend less time prospecting and more time selling. Our partner integrations enable us to deliver richer payer experiences through real-time, bi-directional data exchange. Our partnerships are centered around referrals as between the partners that result in two-party contracts between the customer and ourselves.
Our direct sales team is responsible for outbound lead generation, driving new business and helping to manage account relationships and renewals. Our sales team also maintains close relationships with existing customers and helps identify and understand their specific needs to help inform our product roadmap.
Customer Success
 Our customer success teams have a deep understanding of our customer's unique needs and have developed a relationship management model accordingly. We use what we learn to continuously improve our solutions and the customer experience. As part of our customer success strategy, we have developed an efficient multi-tiered customer support organization. Our teams leverage the latest technology to interact with our clients in the method that is most comfortable to them. Whether leveraging online chat support, emails or phone, our goals are to put the customer first and efficiently serve their needs. We believe in establishing long-lasting partnerships with regular check-ins to ensure customers are realizing the most value from our solution, ultimately supporting retention and growth.
 Research and Development
Research and development is a key factor that drives our product leadership, and we invest substantial time, energy, and resources to ensure we have a deep understanding of our customers’ needs in each vertical we serve. We continually innovate to deliver value-added features and focus on creating solutions that directly address our customers’ pain points. We work closely with our customers to capture their feedback, and we utilize our deep vertical domain expertise to enhance our product design. Our research and development organization consists of engineering, product, and design teams, and these teams are responsible for the design, development, testing, deployment, and ongoing support of our solutions. Research and development spend was $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing 16.0% of revenue, and $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, representing 15.4% of revenue.
 Competition
The market for vertically tailored customer engagement software and integrated payments is highly fragmented. We primarily compete with manual processes, point solution vendors, and legacy and modern solution providers. We believe the combination of our true SaaS solutions, vertical domain expertise, customer and product focus, and exceptional talent distinguishes us from the competition.
For our solutions in our SMB Solutions segment, which include SimplePractice, we primarily compete against pen and paper, point solution vendors, and a number of horizontal and vertically specialized solutions, including practice management software providers. We believe we compete favorably on the following key competitive factors:
•Simplicity and ease of use 
 •Product strategy and speed of innovation 
 •True SaaS product delivery architecture
 •Breadth and depth of solution 
 •Quality and integration of products and features 
 •Brand awareness and reputation 
 •Pricing and costs 
 •Customer support capabilities 
 •Platform security 
 For our solutions in our Enterprise Solutions segment, we primarily compete against bill presentment and payment systems internally developed by financial institutions, as well as legacy and modern solution providers. We believe we compete favorably on the following key competitive factors:
•Product strategy and speed of innovation 
 •True SaaS product delivery architecture
 •Vertically tailored products and features 
 •Ability to drive end user digital adoption 
 •Breadth and depth of solution 


•Ability to integrate with our customers’ back-end core systems 
 •Ease of deployment and implementation speed 
 •Brand awareness and reputation 
 •Pricing and costs 
 •Scalability and reliability 
 •Security 
 •Customer satisfaction 
 •Customer service capabilities 
 •Total cost of ownership and return on investment 
 We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors within the industry verticals we serve, but we expect competition to continue to increase as existing competitors continue to evolve their offerings and as new companies enter our market. To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support.

Regulatory Environment
 Healthcare laws and regulations
Our business is subject to extensive, complex and rapidly changing federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. Various federal and state agencies have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce healthcare laws. These regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations may change periodically, based on changes in regulatory agency enforcement priorities, for example. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that restricts our operations. In addition, our consumer transactions business is subject to certain financial services laws, regulations and rules, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ("PCI-DSS").
U.S. State and Federal Health Information Privacy and Security Laws
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information, including health information. In particular, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (collectively, “HIPAA”) establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”), and require the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form. Certain of our clients are regulated as covered entities under HIPAA. As a service provider that creates, receives, maintains or transmits PHI on behalf of our covered entity customers, we are a “business associate” as defined under HIPAA. Since the effective date of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule on September 23, 2013, certain HIPAA requirements are also directly applicable to business associates.
Violations of HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties and a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards. We must also comply with HIPAA’s breach notification rule. Under the breach notification rule, business associates must notify covered entities of a breach, and those covered entities must notify affected individuals without unreasonable delay in the case of a breach of unsecured PHI, which may compromise the privacy, security or integrity of the PHI. In addition, notification must be provided to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

(“HHS”) and the local media in cases where a breach affects more than 500 individuals. Breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals must be reported to HHS on an annual basis. In the event of a breach, our covered entity customers may require we provide assistance in the breach notification process and may seek indemnification and other contractual remedies.
State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. In addition, HIPAA mandates that HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and their business associates for compliance. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. In light of the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, recent enforcement activity, and statements from HHS, we expect increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts. Further, proposed changes to HIPAA provisions may increase our costs to comply.
Many states in which we operate and in which our patients reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA and other federal privacy laws. For example, the laws of the State of California, in which we operate, are more restrictive than HIPAA. Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws we are subject to, in addition to HIPAA. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. In addition, state laws are changing rapidly. For example, California recently passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which went into effect January 1, 2020. While any information we maintain in our role as a business associate may be exempt from the CCPA, other records and information we maintain on our customers may be subject to the CCPA. There is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law, to which we may be subject.
In addition to HIPAA, state health information privacy and state health information privacy laws, we may be subject to other state and federal privacy laws, including laws that prohibit unfair privacy and security practices and deceptive statements about privacy and security and laws that place specific requirements on certain types of activities, such as data security and texting.
In recent years, there have been a number of well publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of personally identifiable information and PHI. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and state officials. In addition, under HIPAA and pursuant to the related contracts that we enter into with our business associates, we must report breaches of unsecured PHI to our contractual partners following discovery of the breach. Notification must also be made in certain circumstances to affected individuals, federal authorities and others.
Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the “TCPA”) is a federal statute that protects consumers from unwanted telephone calls and faxes. Since its inception, the TCPA’s purview has extended to text messages sent to consumers. Our services that leverage text messaging are subject to the TCPA and its regulations and agency guidance.
State Fee-splitting Laws
We frequently enter into services contracts with healthcare practitioner organizations pursuant to which we provide them with billing, coding and claims submission, insurance enrollment verification, patient intake, scheduling, appointment reminders, and a range of other services. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws, including laws that prohibit fee-splitting, or the sharing of professional services income with nonprofessional or business interests.
Some fee-splitting requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our agreements with practitioners licensed in the state. These laws vary from state to state and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. A determination of non-compliance against us and our arrangements with our healthcare practitioner customers could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of practitioner licenses, and/or restructuring of these arrangements.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
Although we do not directly provide any items or services that are reimbursed by any third-party payor, EHR vendors and practice management solutions providers like us are nonetheless subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict certain business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws are complex, may change rapidly and their application to our specific solutions and relationships may not be clear and may be applied to our business in ways we do not anticipate. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute ("AKS") prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The AKS includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. Failure to meet the requirements of a safe harbor, however, does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances, including the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse, and may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
The Federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”) prohibits a person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or from making a false statement or using a false record to have a claim approved. The FCA further provides that a lawsuit thereunder may be initiated in the name of the United States by an individual, a “whistleblower,” who is an original source of the allegations. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil FCA. The government has prosecuted practice management service providers for causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims in violation of the FCA, and vendors of EHR software for, among other things, misrepresenting the capabilities of software and payment of kickbacks to certain customers in exchange for promoting products in violation of the AKS and FCA. Penalties for a violation of the FCA include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim.
HIPAA also established federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Several states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any payor, including patients and commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program.
 Violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, additional reporting requirements and compliance oversight obligations, contractual damages, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and/ or imprisonment.
Reimbursement
Our healthcare practitioner customers are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including those that administer government healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Accordingly, our healthcare practitioner customers are sensitive to legislative and regulatory changes in, and limitations on, the government healthcare programs and changes in reimbursement policies, processes, and payment rates. During recent years, there have been numerous federal legislative and administrative actions that have affected government healthcare programs, including adjustments that have reduced or increased payments to healthcare providers and adjustments that have affected the complexity of our work and required modifications to our platforms. For example, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) established a Quality Payment Program that requires provider groups to track and report a multitude of data relating to quality, clinical practice improvement activities, use of an EHR, and cost. Success or failure with respect to these measures may impact reimbursement in future years. Similarly, healthcare reform is causing some payors to transition from volume to value-based reimbursement models, which can include risk-sharing, bundled payment and other innovative approaches. It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement additional reductions, increases, or changes in reimbursement in the future under government programs that adversely

affect our practitioner customer base or increase the cost of providing our services. Any such changes could adversely affect our own financial condition by reducing the reimbursement rates of our practitioner customers.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system, many of which are intended to contain or reduce healthcare costs. By way of example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA and on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the lower courts’ decision and effectively dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. It remains unclear how healthcare reform measures enacted by Congress or implemented by the Biden administration or other challenges to the ACA, if any, will impact the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken.
 Additional state and federal health care reform measures may also be adopted in the future, any of which could have a material impact on our and our customers’ business and financial condition.
 Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Laws and Regulations
 Pursuant to our agreements with third-party payment processors that process bill payments conducted through our solutions, we are contractually obligated to perform certain functions which relate to their compliance obligations under anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations. Our failure to properly perform these functions can create criminal and civil liability, as well as reputational risk, for these third-party payment processors partners, which could require us to provide indemnification under our contractual obligations, as well potentially subject us to additional operational expenses if it is necessary to replace such third-party payment processor partner(s). As such, we must invest adequate resources in our compliance function, which may result in increased expenses due to changes in law or additional complexity in our products and services.
Human Capital
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2022, our workforce consisted of 971 employees, substantially all of which were employed on a full-time basis in the United States. We also engage contractors and consultants. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. We are highly dependent on our management, highly skilled software engineers, sales personnel, and other professionals, and it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain valuable employees. To facilitate attraction and retention, we strive to make EngageSmart a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation and benefits programs. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our employee relations are strong.
Culture
 At EngageSmart, we believe our culture is a competitive differentiator that drives our success. Our culture is built on four pillars: love, agency, connection, and impact.
•Love. We promote love for our teammates, our customers, and our partners. Our culture is one of commitment to customer success and a collaborative environment, where people come to work with the knowledge that their work has purpose and their individual contributions matter.
 •Agency. We want to inspire agency in one another, in our customers, and in their clients. Agency gives people the permission to try new things, the autonomy to get things done without frustration, and access to more and better options.
 •Connection. We believe the true aim of engagement is connection. Our solutions connect legacy industries with leading technologies and enable more meaningful connections between our customers and their clients. 


•Impact. Our purpose is impact. In addition to bringing delight to the everyday experience between organizations and their customers, we are committed to serving the community. This includes the places our teams are based and the entire planet. 
 Servant leadership permeates our organization and underpins our growth mindset. As servant leaders, our team members believe that our primary responsibility is to remove barriers for customers, partners and teammates with whom they work most closely. The servant leadership model puts customers and front-line staff at the top of the organizational chart. We believe the best leaders empower their teams to excel. Our employees feel empowered to respond rapidly, innovate quickly, and build effectively, enabling us to maintain product leadership and help our customers win in the marketplace. Our talented employees love to win, and we win when our customers and partners win.
We are a team committed to bettering the lives of people and the planet. With unique talents and shared passion for positive impact, we invite employees to nominate charities of their choosing, and EngageSmart matches their contributions. Employees are also given time off each year to volunteer in their community. EngageSmart supports the missions of key organizations like BUILD Boston, partnering to empower the youth from under-resourced communities.
 Together, our entire EngageSmart community cultivates a company culture grounded in giving back and finding joy in everything we do.
 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging ("DEI&B")
 As we value diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, EngageSmart seeks individuals of all backgrounds and experiences. We are creating an environment where everyone can thrive and it is EngageSmart’s strategy to ensure DEI&B is integrated into the fabric of our culture, our values, and our business model. Our customers are diverse, so we are building a team that is too. Through initiatives like our annual inclusion survey and our employee resource groups, we are building the cultural foundation that gives people the emotional and physical space to bring their authentic selves to work.
Learning and Development
 EngageSmart fosters a learning culture where employees are empowered to own their career progression and professional development through robust career conversations, self-assessment, and internal and external learning and development programs. Our EngageSmart University platform provides our employees with a single access point for all internal training programs, as well as on-demand virtual learning resources to help them learn, grow, and develop. Our internal leadership development programs include cohort learning, peer coaching, and informal and formal mentoring.
Compensation and Benefits
 At EngageSmart we recruit, retain and develop diverse talent. We are committed to providing market-competitive compensation, benefits and equity. We routinely conduct market analyses on total compensation and benefits to ensure we remain competitive based on an employee’s role, level, performance and location.
 We have a large offering of health, welfare and retirement benefits that employees are eligible to participate in including medical, dental, vision, life insurance, flexible time off and paid parental leave. In addition, employees have access to various voluntary benefits including our 401(k) plan which includes a company match, flexible spending, employee assistant program ("EAP"), tuition reimbursement, pet insurance and legal insurance.
 Employees are eligible to participate in our equity incentive programs. These programs include grants of stock options and restricted stock units ("RSUs") to employees, as well as an employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP"). We believe that all employees should have “ownership” in our business.
 At EngageSmart, we are a team committed to bettering the lives of people and the planet. With unique talents and shared passion for positive impact, annually we select charities to support, and EngageSmart matches employee contributions for those charities. Additionally, we offer flexible schedules to empower employees to volunteer in their communities.
