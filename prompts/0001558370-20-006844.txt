ITEM 1. BUSINESS
​
History and Company Overview
​
At Home is the leading home décor superstore based on the number of our locations and our large format stores that we believe dedicate more space per store to home décor than any other player in the industry. We are focused on providing the broadest assortment of products for any room, in any style, for any budget. We utilize our space advantage to out-assort our competition, offering over 50,000 SKUs throughout our stores. Our differentiated merchandising strategy allows us to identify on-trend products and then value engineer those products to provide desirable aesthetics at attractive price points for our customers. Over 70% of our products are unbranded, private label or specifically designed for us. We believe that our broad and comprehensive offering and compelling value proposition combine to create a leading destination for home décor with the opportunity to continue taking market share in a highly fragmented and growing industry.

As of January 25, 2020, our store base was comprised of 212 stores across 39 states, averaging approximately 105,000 square feet per store. We utilize a flexible and disciplined real estate strategy that allows us to successfully open and operate stores from 75,000 to 165,000 square feet across a wide range of formats and markets. All of our stores that were open as of the beginning of fiscal year 2020 except one are profitable, and stores that have been open for more than a year average approximately $6 million in net sales. We believe our two distribution centers in Plano, Texas and Carlisle, Pennsylvania collectively should be able to support more than 350 stores. In addition, based on our internal analysis and research conducted for us by Buxton Company, a leading real estate analytics firm (referred to herein as “Buxton”), we believe that we have the potential to expand to at least 600 stores in the United States over the long term although we do not currently have an anticipated timeframe to reach this potential.
​
At Home (formerly known as Garden Ridge) was founded in 1979 in Garden Ridge, Texas, a suburb of San Antonio. We quickly gained a loyal following in our Texas home market and expanded thereafter. Throughout our history, we have cultivated a passionate customer base that shops our stores for the unique, wide assortment of products offered at value price points. After our Company was acquired in 2011 by an investment group led by certain affiliates of AEA Investors LP (collectively, “AEA”) and Starr Investment Holdings, LLC (“Starr Investments”), we began a series of strategic investments in the business. 
​
Following the completion of several secondary equity offerings of shares of our common stock, as of January 25, 2020, AEA held approximately 16.4% of our outstanding common stock and Starr Investments held approximately 6.7% of our outstanding common stock. 
​
We have developed a highly efficient operating model that seeks to drive growth and profitability while minimizing operating risk. Our merchandising, sourcing and pricing strategies generate strong and consistent performance across our product offering and throughout the entire year. Through specialized in-store merchandising and visual navigation elements, we enable a self-service model that minimizes in-store staffing needs and allows us to deliver exceptional value to our customers.
​
We believe that our differentiated home décor concept, flexible real estate strategy and highly efficient operating model create competitive advantages that have driven our financial success.
​
Our Growth Strategies
​
We expect to drive strong sales growth and leading profitability by pursuing the following strategies:
​
Expand Our Store Base
​
We believe there is a significant whitespace opportunity to expand in both existing and new markets in the United States. Over the long term, we believe we have the potential to expand to at least 600 stores in the United States based on our internal analysis and research conducted by Buxton. During fiscal year 2020, we opened 32 new stores, net of three relocations and one store closure. During fiscal year 2021, we have opened seven new stores to date, but, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended additional new store openings. We will continue to evaluate our future store opening plans and continue to believe we could grow our store base at a rate of approximately 10% in future years. The rate of future growth in any particular period is inherently uncertain and is subject to numerous factors that are outside of our control. As a result, we do not currently have an anticipated timeframe to reach our long-term potential. We believe our two distribution centers in Plano, Texas and Carlisle, Pennsylvania, collectively should be able to support more than 350 stores.
​
We have used our site selection model to score over 20,000 big box retail locations throughout the United States, which positions us to be able to act quickly as locations become available, and we have developed detailed market maps for each U.S. market that guide our deliberate expansion strategy. We have opened stores in a mix of existing and new markets. New stores in existing markets have increased our total market share due to higher brand awareness. We believe there is still opportunity to continue adding locations in even our most established markets. In addition, we anticipate a limited number of relocations periodically as we evaluate our position in the market upon the impending expiration of lease terms. We have demonstrated our ability to open stores successfully in a diverse range of 

2



new markets across the country. Our portable concept has delivered consistent store economics across all markets, from smaller, less dense locations to larger, more heavily populated metropolitan areas. 
​
Our new store model combines high average unit volumes and high margins with low net capital investment and occupancy costs, resulting in cash flow generation early in the life of a store. Our stores typically mature within six months of opening. On average, over the past three fiscal years, our new store sites which are leased or purchased require approximately $4 million to $5 million of net investment and our new build stores require approximately $2 million to $3 million of net investment (net of sale leaseback proceeds). In previous fiscal years, we have delivered an average payback period of approximately two and a half years for our new leased and purchased stores and less than one and a half years for our new build stores. For fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, 83%, 74% and 75% of our new stores, respectively, have been leased at the time of opening.
​
Drive Comparable Store Sales
​
We will seek to drive demand and customer spend by providing a targeted, exciting product selection and a differentiated shopping experience, including the following specific strategic initiatives:
​

● | Grow the At Home brand through marketing and advertising as well as community engagements that target the home décor enthusiast to drive increased traffic to our stores;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Continuously introduce new and on-trend products to appeal to a wide range of customers and improve the mix of our product assortment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Enhance inventory planning and allocation capabilities to get the right products in the right store at the right time;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Enhance direct sourcing of our products in order to provide everyday low prices and give value back to consumers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Leverage private label and co-branded consumer credit card program to reward customers for continued loyalty while also providing promotional financing offers on qualifying purchases;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Expand Insider Perks loyalty program for frequent shoppers to provide customers with offers, rewards and other benefits and utilize data regarding our customers' preferences and spending patterns; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Continue to strengthen our visual merchandising such as vignettes, end caps and feature tables to inspire our customers and generate in-store demand.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Build the At Home Brand and Create Awareness
​
During fiscal year 2015, we launched the At Home brand, which we believe better communicates our positioning as the leading home décor superstore. Additionally, we re-established a marketing function and reinstated marketing spend to highlight our new brand, broad product offering and compelling value proposition. Given the relative newness and limited awareness of the At Home brand in certain markets, we believe there is still a significant opportunity to grow our brand and build awareness in both existing and new markets.
​
To address this opportunity, we have increased our marketing spend in recent years to improve our brand awareness and to drive traffic to our website and to our stores. We increased spend from nearly zero in fiscal year 2013 to approximately 2.7% of net sales in fiscal year 2018, approximately 3.1% of net sales in fiscal year 2019 and approximately 3.3% of net sales in fiscal year 2020. We intend to continue to allocate marketing spend to both traditional and digital media to increase awareness of our differentiated value proposition among specialty home décor retail and to drive both new and existing customers to our stores. However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have significantly curtailed our advertising spend, consulting projects and non-essential operating expenses.
​

Continue Enhancing Shopping Experience through Digital Initiatives
​
Through our customer research, we have learned that while many home décor shoppers prefer to browse online for ideas, inspiration and general product information, they prefer to complete their home décor purchases in person. Through our email database, our text program and our website, we are able to share new product launches, highlight key categories and provide our customers with décor ideas and inspiration. In addition, we launched our Insider Perks program in the second half of fiscal year 2018, which has 6.5 million members as of January 25, 2020. Our Insider Perks program members have exclusive access to an annual birthday offer, receiptless returns, advanced notice of new merchandise and clearance events as well as compelling content from home décor influencers.
​
In fiscal year 2020, we continued to make enhancements to our website, such as rolling out local in-stock availability across the fleet. We also piloted the first stages of a Buy Online Pick-Up In-Store (“BOPIS”) initiative during the fourth fiscal quarter by offering a reserve online capability in select markets and substantially increased our BOPIS capabilities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, more than 200 stores, or over 90% of our store base, have BOPIS capabilities. 
​
Our Industry
​
We compete in the large, growing and highly fragmented home furnishings and décor market.
​
Unlike other big box retail categories (e.g., office supplies, home improvement and electronics) where the top retailers hold a significant share of the overall market, the top three retailers in the home décor and furnishings category make up less than 25% of the market share. We believe we are uniquely positioned in the market, focused on providing the broadest assortment of home décor products at value price points. In addition, the size of our stores enables us to carry a broad offering of fully assembled, larger merchandise, unlike many of our competitors, who are space constrained from providing a similar offering. We believe our focus on a broad assortment at value price points also positions us well within a fragmented market while also supporting our customer’s passion about, and love for, decorating her home.
​
The home furnishings and décor market includes a diverse set of categories and retail formats. However, we believe that we do not have a direct competitor, as no brick and mortar retailer matches our size, scale or scope of the product assortment that we offer at everyday low prices. While we have no direct competitor, certain products that we offer do compete with offerings by companies in the following segments:
​

● | Specialty Home Décor / Organization and Furniture retailers (e.g., Bed Bath & Beyond, The Container Store, Ethan Allen, Havertys, Home Goods, Pier 1 Imports and Williams-Sonoma) have stores that are typically smaller (approximately 10,000 to 35,000 square feet on average) and we believe their home décor product offering is much narrower than ours and often is priced at a substantial premium.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Mass / Club retailers (e.g., Costco, Target and Wal-Mart Stores) only dedicate a small portion of their selling spaces to home décor products and focus on the most popular SKUs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Arts / Craft / Hobby retailers (e.g., Hobby Lobby, Jo-Ann Stores and Michaels Stores) target customers who prefer to create the product themselves, whereas our customer prefers finished products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Discount retailers (e.g., Big Lots, Burlington and Tuesday Morning) have a home décor product offering that is typically limited, offered at deep discounts and often dependent on their ability to purchase close-out or liquidated merchandise from manufacturers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Home Improvement retailers (e.g., Home Depot and Lowe’s) have a product offering that is primarily focused on home improvement and repair items, although we do compete with them in seasonal and outdoor products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Online home décor retailers (e.g., Wayfair) offer a broad selection of products in home furnishings and décor that is typically weighted toward more expensive items. Conversely, we focus primarily on the attractive decorative accents and accessories portion of the market, generating an average basket of approximately $70, where we can employ our efficient operating model to generate attractive economics. Other online retailers (e.g., Amazon) may offer home décor products, but we believe we are able to offer a comparable breadth of product assortment and frequently lower prices. According to a study performed by Cooper Roberts Research in fiscal year 2020, approximately two-thirds of home décor purchases are still made in stores. Additionally, home décor shoppers look for selection, value, quality and uniqueness when deciding where to shop for home décor, all of which are key to our value proposition. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty in the market, and home décor shopper preferences may evolve in the future.

​
Our Merchandise
​
We have the largest assortment of home décor products among all big box retailers. With four main design lifestyles, from traditional to global and from farmhouse to modern, we cover the full spectrum of home décor styles and we believe we have something for everyone. We are advantageously situated as a value player in the home décor market, with an average price point of less than $15 and typical customer spend of approximately $70 per visit.
​
Our merchant organization is focused on finding or creating products that meet our customers’ aesthetic requirements at attractive price points. A core goal of our buyers is to ensure we deliver our targeted selling margins across our entire product portfolio and, as a result, we enjoy product margins that are consistent across our product offering.
​
Our product design process begins with inspiration. We seek to capitalize on existing trends and home décor fashions across various price points and make them accessible rather than drive new trends. We monitor emerging trends through a wide range of home décor industry sources including competitors, media sources, vendors, trade shows, various online outlets and user generated content (e.g., Pinterest and Houzz) to stay current with consumer preferences. We then identify new product opportunities or any gaps in our offering and work closely with our vendors to design products to meet her needs at accessible price points. Our merchandising team also closely monitors our sales trends and new product launches to ensure our store offering remains fresh and relevant.
​
We employ an everyday low pricing strategy that offers our customers the best possible pricing without the need for consistent discounts or promotions. When customers view our prices, they can be confident in the value they receive and do not need to wait for sales or coupons to make purchasing decisions. We believe this results in continued traffic to our stores. Over 80% of our net sales occur at full price, with the balance attributable to selective markdowns used to clear slow-moving inventory or post-dated seasonal product. For the limited set of products that are directly comparable to products offered by other retailers, we seek to offer prices below our specialty competitors and at or below our mass retail competitors. We allow for merchandise to be returned within 60 days from the purchase date.
​
Our merchant team consists of approximately 120 people and includes a Chief Merchandising Officer, divisional merchandising managers, buyers, merchandising support staff, a merchandising operations team, an inventory planning and allocation team, product development and trend team and a direct sourcing team. Our inventory planners work with our buyers to ensure that the appropriate level of inventory for each product is stocked across our store base. We purchase our inventory through a centralized system that buys for the entire chain versus individual stores. We believe this strategy allows us to take advantage of volume discounts and improves controls over inventory and product mix to ensure that we are disciplined about the level of inventory we carry.
​
Product Mix
​
Home furnishings, which generally consists of accent furniture, furniture, mirrors, patio cushions, rugs and wall art, comprised approximately 43%, 44% and 45% of total net sales for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, accent décor, which generally consists of artificial flowers and trees, bath, bedding, candles, garden and outdoor décor, holiday accessories, home organization, pillows, pottery, vases and window treatments, comprised 

5



approximately 53%, 52% and 51% of total net sales for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our superstore format and unique approach to merchandising result in our ability to offer multiple styles, colors and design elements most other retailers are unable to carry.
​
Sourcing
​
We believe our sourcing model provides us with significant flexibility to control our product costs. We work very closely with over 500 vendors to value engineer products at price points that deliver excellent value to our customers. In fiscal year 2020, approximately 35% of our merchandise was purchased from domestic vendors and 65% was purchased from foreign vendors in countries such as China, Vietnam, India, Turkey and Hong Kong. In addition, many of our domestic vendors purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources. Lead times vary depending on the product, ranging from one week to nine months. In fiscal year 2018, we established a direct sourcing function to allow us to continue to increase our direct purchases from overseas factories, rather than purchasing through domestic agents or trading companies. We believe this represents an opportunity to increase our access to unique and quality products while reducing our product costs.
​
We seek to build long-term relationships with our vendor partners, who can provide support for our various marketing and in-store merchandising initiatives. However, we believe we are not dependent on any one vendor and have no long-term purchase commitments or arrangements. For many of our vendors, we are their fastest growing and, sometimes, largest account, which promotes collaboration between our companies. In fiscal year 2020, our top ten vendors accounted for approximately 20% of total purchases, with our largest vendor representing less than 5%. We believe our vendor partner relationships will continue to support our business growth.
​
Our manufacturing and transportation supply chains may be subject to the impact of global pandemics, such as COVID-19. We may be impacted by factory closures, port closures and the inability of our vendors to produce and ship products. In addition, our supply chain may be subject to financial risks as raw material producers and manufacturers experience financial hardships, closures or the inability to attract a labor force. While production of certain of our product categories is concentrated in localized regions that are subject to the COVID-19 pandemic, our broader production base is diversified across regions with opportunities to make strategic shifts as business conditions allow.
​
Our Stores
​
We currently operate 212 stores in 39 states across the United States. A summary of our store locations by state as of January 25, 2020 is included in “Item 2. Properties”.
​
Store Layout
​
Our stores vary in size between 75,000 and 165,000 square feet with an average of approximately 105,000 square feet. Our locations have a similar store layout that is specifically designed to engage our customers. We design our stores as shoppable warehouses with wide aisles, an interior race track and clear signage that enable customers to easily navigate the store. We also have store maps available at the entrances and on shopping carts for our customer to use while she shops. Throughout our stores, we merchandise products logically by color, design and size in order to appeal to our core shopper’s buying preferences and use feature tables and end caps to create continuous visual interest and to highlight value. Additionally, we utilize product vignettes that offer design inspiration and coordinated product ideas to our customers. Our large store format allows us to maintain high in-stock positions and sell larger-sized and fully assembled products. To make her shopping experience easier and support our efficient operating model, we install fixture shelves lower to the ground so that products are easily reachable and require minimal staff assistance. We also utilize special fixtures for our products such as wall art, mirrors and rugs to allow easy viewing, improved shopability and minimized product damage. We have a centralized checkout lane with multiple registers that makes the checkout process simple and efficient.
​
In fiscal year 2020, we piloted the first stages of our BOPIS initiative during the fourth fiscal quarter by offering a reserve online capability in select markets. We have since expedited the expansion of BOPIS capabilities in response to 

6



the COVID-19 pandemic to more than 200 stores, or over 90% of our store base. We also launched a curbside pickup option.
​
Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, to further our omnichannel capabilities and provide our customers with more ways to shop, we expanded our partnership with PICKUP, a last-mile logistics service, in 125 of our stores, subject to state and local mandates. Through that partnership, At Home now also provides customers the option of contactless local home delivery starting at $10 within a 30 mile radius of participating stores. Deliveries typically occur same-day, but next-day service is also available. PICKUP has experience in several markets with many major retailers. Nonetheless, deliveries from our stores follow completion of the sales transaction with our customer, thus minimizing exposure we might have in connection with the delivery. 
​
Store Operations
​
We centralize major decisions relating to merchandising, inventory and pricing in order to allow our in-store team to focus on creating a clean and organized shopping environment. Our stores are typically led by a store director, a store manager and have a general staff averaging 25 employees. Store employees are broadly split into two functional groups, customer service and operations, thereby allowing us to maximize efficiencies while aligning employees to the function that best suits their skills. Our proprietary labor model optimizes staffing levels based on hourly sales and traffic volumes. Additionally, employees utilize downtime to stock shelves and displays with new inventory. This model provides us with the flexibility to meet various seasonal demands while enabling consistent labor margins throughout the year. Our stores are managed company-wide by our Director of Stores, two regional managers and twenty district managers.
​
Our employees are a critical component of our success and we are focused on attracting, retaining and promoting the best talent in our stores. We recognize and reward team members who meet our high-performance standards. All employees are eligible to participate in our bonus incentive program and store directors are able to participate in an unlimited bonus incentive program based primarily on exceeding store level sales targets. We also recognize individual performance through internal promotions and provide opportunities for advancement throughout our organization. We provide training for all new hires and ongoing training for existing employees.
​
Real Estate Strategy
​
Expansion Opportunities
​
Our retail concept has been successful across a number of geographic markets spanning populations of approximately 150,000 to over five million people. Our new stores that have been opened over the past five completed fiscal years have delivered first year annualized sales of approximately $6.2 million for new store sites which are leased or purchased and approximately $8.0 million for new build stores across both existing and new markets. Over the past five fiscal years, we have successfully opened 142 new stores in a mix of existing and new markets. Our recent store growth is summarized in the following table:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
------------------------------+---+-------------------+---+------------------+---+------------------+---+------------------+---+-----------------
​ | ​ | Fiscal Year Ended
​ | ​ | January 30, 2016 | ​ | January 28, 2017 | ​ | January 27, 2018 | ​ | January 26, 2019 | ​ | January 25, 2020
Beginning of period | ​ | 81 | ​ | 100 | ​ | 123 | ​ | 149 | ​ | 180 
Openings | ​ | 20 | ​ | 24 | ​ | 28 | ​ | 34 | ​ | 36 
Relocations | ​ | — | ​ | (1) | ​ | (2) | ​ | (2) | ​ | (3)

Total stores at end of period | ​ | 100 | ​ | 123 | ​ | 149 | ​ | 180 | ​ | 212 

​
During fiscal year 2020, we opened 32 new stores, net of three relocated stores and one store closure. Based on our internal analysis and research conducted for us by Buxton, we believe that we have the potential to expand to at least 600 stores in the United States over the long term, or approximately three times our footprint of 212 stores as of January 25, 2020. The rate of future growth in any particular period is inherently uncertain and is subject to numerous factors that are outside of our control. As a result, we do not currently have an anticipated timeframe to reach this potential. We believe our distribution centers collectively should be able to support more than 350 stores. We expect to continue to be 

7



disciplined in our approach to opening new stores, focusing on expanding our presence in existing markets while minimizing the risk of competition between new and existing stores as well as entering adjacent geographies. We also plan to act on compelling opportunities we identify in new markets.
​
Our store growth has historically been supported by new store economics that we believe are compelling. Over the past three fiscal years, our new stores have generated an average of $6.7 million of net sales within the first full year of operations and reached maturity within the first six months. On average, over the past three fiscal years, our new store sites which are leased or purchased require approximately $4 million to $5 million of net investment and our new build stores require approximately $2 million to $3 million of net investment (net of sale leaseback proceeds). We have delivered an average payback period of approximately two and a half years for our new leased and purchased stores and less than one and a half years for our new build stores.
​
Site Selection and Availability
​
We have developed a highly analytical approach to real estate site selection with a stringent new store approval process. Our dedicated real estate team spends considerable time evaluating prospective sites before submitting a comprehensive approval package to our real estate committee, comprised of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Development Officer. We target markets that meet our specific demographic and site evaluation criteria and complete substantial research before opening a new site. We use a proprietary model which takes into account several demand factors including population density of our target customer, median household income, home ownership rates, retail adjacencies, competitor presence, presence of existing At Home locations and local economic growth metrics. Primary site evaluation criteria include availability of attractive lease terms, sufficient box size, co-tenancy, convenient parking, traffic patterns, visibility and access from major roadways. We typically favor locations near other big box retailers that drive strong customer traffic to the area.
​
We believe there will continue to be an ample supply of large format real estate in the United States that is attractive to us, driven by multi-chain, national retailers relocating or closing stores, a number of retailers shifting to smaller locations and the relative lack of new retail concepts using larger store formats. We believe we are one of the only growing, large format retailers in the country. As a result, we have become a direct beneficiary of this available real estate and of various retailers looking to quickly shed stores. We typically offer a convenient solution to any selling or leasing party as we are able to take a wide variety of existing store spaces, move quickly and require little investment in time, resources or capital on their part. We take a disciplined approach to how we enter and build out our presence in markets and seek to optimize sales in a deliberate, carefully planned manner. In order to act quickly on new opportunities, we have scored over 20,000 big box retail locations in the United States with a proprietary site selection model. As a result of our proven track record, we have developed strong relationships with brokers, landlords and big box retailers and are often the first to receive a call when locations become available.
​
Site Development and Financing
​
We have a flexible and balanced approach to site development that allows us to optimize the investment characteristics of each new store and maintain our robust new store pipeline. We can lease a second generation property, purchase a second generation building or build a new location from the ground up.
​
For purchased properties or new development builds, we can extract capital using sale-leasebacks through a proven and disciplined approach. We have relationships with a number of the major real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), many of which have demonstrated interest in our portfolio of assets. We have completed nine sale-leaseback transactions generating approximately $442 million in gross proceeds in the past five fiscal years.
​
We have developed an efficient process from site selection through new store opening. Our three-pronged approach to site development allows us to negotiate very favorable real estate terms that typically include low occupancy costs, the ability to unilaterally “opt out” of leased locations, and other features that provide us with flexibility to manage our store portfolio.

Marketing
​
Our marketing and advertising strategies seek to effectively and efficiently communicate our compelling value proposition to an increasing base of home décor enthusiasts. Our goal is to build deeper connections with our core customers, while attracting new customers to the At Home brand. We increased our marketing spend from nearly zero in fiscal year 2013 to approximately 2.7% of net sales in fiscal year 2018, approximately 3.1% of net sales in fiscal year 2019 and approximately 3.3% of net sales in fiscal year 2020. We expect that marketing and advertising spend will continue to be a significant percentage of net sales in future fiscal years. However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have significantly curtailed our advertising spend, consulting projects and non-essential operating expenses.
​
The home décor enthusiast views her home as a place that is constantly evolving with each season as well as everyday events in her life. At Home’s mission is to offer her the biggest selection of styles at the best prices, giving her endless possibilities and the confidence that she will find the perfect products at the perfect price every time she shops. We engage with her across various marketing channels before, during and after her store visit. We have built relationships with home décor influencers, leveraging Facebook and Instagram. We use email and text message marketing to inspire her with seasonally relevant décor and will be growing the reach of these efforts as we focus on expanding our base of 6.5 million Insider Perks customers. 
​
We also use traditional and digital media platforms (such as paid digital, outdoor, direct mail, paid search and social media) to build broader brand awareness and to drive traffic to our website and our stores. To launch our brand during new store openings, we have evolved our strategy through tactical testing to get to an effective and cost efficient mix of media, including outdoor, direct mail and social media.
​
In fiscal year 2018, we launched our Insider Perks program, which has 6.5 million members as of January 25, 2020. Our Insider Perks program members have exclusive access to an annual birthday offer, receiptless returns, advanced notice of new merchandise and clearance events as well as compelling content from home décor influencers. In addition, we also have an At Home branded credit card program through Synchrony Bank that includes loyalty incentives for our Insider Perks members. This program launched during fiscal year 2018 and allows At Home cardholders to take advantage of promotional financing offers on qualifying purchases, loyalty rewards and other benefits. 
​
In fiscal year 2020, we continued to make enhancements to our website, such as rolling out local in-stock availability across the fleet. In fiscal year 2020, we also piloted the first stages of a BOPIS initiative during the fourth fiscal quarter by offering a reserve online capability in select markets and substantially increased our BOPIS capabilities in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, more than 200 stores, or over 90% of our store base, have BOPIS capabilities. 
​
Distribution
​
We operate a 592,000 square foot distribution center in Plano, Texas, which also serves as our corporate headquarters. We have invested in automating our Plano, Texas facility, implementing warehouse management software and robotics to efficiently handle daily product deliveries. At the beginning of fiscal year 2020, we opened our 800,000 square foot second distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, which required an additional incremental capital investment of $5.5 million, $13.0 million and $1.1 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. With the opening of our second distribution center, we estimate we should be collectively able to support more than 350 stores. We also have an additional 555,000 square foot warehouse in Garland, Texas, for initial inventory build-up for new store openings. The improvements to our Plano, Texas distribution center and the opening of our Carlisle, Pennsylvania distribution center will continue to support our needs as we expand our store base.
​
The vast majority of our current products are shipped directly to our distribution centers, which serve as cross-dock facilities, storing very limited inventory on site. In order to streamline store operations and reduce labor requirements, all of the merchandise in our distribution centers is prepared for the sales floor prior to transport. We

generally ship merchandise to our stores between one and five times a week, depending on the season and the volume of a specific store, utilizing contract carriers for all shipments.
​
Seasonality
​
Our business has historically been moderately seasonal, with a meaningful portion of our sales dedicated to seasonal and holiday merchandise, resulting in the realization of higher portions of net sales and operating income in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to the importance of our peak sales periods, which include the spring and year-end holiday decorating seasons, the second and fourth fiscal quarters have historically contributed, and are expected to continue to contribute, significantly to our operating results for the entire fiscal year. In anticipation of seasonal increases in sales activity during these periods, we incur significant additional expense prior to and during our peak seasonal periods, which we may finance with additional short-term borrowings. These expenses may include the acquisition of additional inventory, seasonal staffing needs and other similar items.
​
Information Systems
​
We believe that our management information systems will support our growth and enhance our competitive position. Our efficient operating model is supported by using industry standard applications in the areas of merchandising, store systems, replenishment, distribution and financial systems. We use a combination of these industry standard systems along with automated and easy to use proprietary systems to support all areas of our business. Over the past seven fiscal years, we have invested in IT systems and infrastructure, including investments in merchandising, planning and allocation (JDA), POS systems (IBM/Toshiba), distribution center (PKMS), order management (KIBO), e-commerce (SalesForce), relating to our BOPIS program, and finance and accounting (SAP) to ensure our systems are robust and scalable. Additionally, over the past seven fiscal years we have invested in data centers and additional IT team members to provide appropriate support and project delivery capabilities needed for our growth.

Employees
​
As of January 25, 2020, we employed approximately 6,289 employees, including 5,690 store employees and 599 other employees across the corporate and distribution center functions. Of the 5,690 store employees, 632 were full-time salaried level staff and the remaining employees consisted of a mix of full-time and part-time hourly workers. Based on the level of transactions experienced at different times of the day, week and year, store labor is planned to serve customers effectively during peak periods while minimizing overall labor costs. None of our employees are currently covered under any collective bargaining agreements.
​
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and store closures resulting from of shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders by state and local governments, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 we eliminated approximately 10% of home office roles, primarily related to new store development and openings, and implemented temporary furloughs of approximately 30% of home office associates and approximately 15% of store employees (a portion of whom have been reinstated as of the filing of this report) and a hiring freeze.
