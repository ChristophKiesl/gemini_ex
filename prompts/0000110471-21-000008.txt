Other Businesses
In addition to its reportable segments, the Company operates a performance leather business, sourcing operations and a multi-brand consumer-direct business.
Wolverine Leathers Division - The Wolverine Leathers Division markets pigskin leather for use primarily in the footwear industry. The Company believes pigskin leather offers superior performance and other advantages over cowhide leather. The Company’s waterproof and stain resistant leathers are featured in some of the Company’s footwear lines and also sold to external footwear brands.
Sourcing Division - The sourcing division earns third-party commission revenue by providing consulting services related to product development, production control, quality assurance, materials procurement, compliance and other services.
Multi-brand Consumer-Direct Division - The multi-brand consumer-direct division includes retail stores that sell footwear and apparel from the Company's brand portfolio and other brands.
Marketing
The Company’s marketing strategy is to develop brand-specific plans and related promotional materials that foster a consistent message for each of the Company’s core brands across the globe. Each reportable segment has dedicated marketing personnel who develop the marketing strategies for specific brands. Marketing campaigns and strategies vary by brand, but are generally designed to target consumers in order to increase awareness of, and affinity for, the Company’s brands. The Company’s advertisements typically emphasize fashion, comfort, quality, durability, functionality and other performance and lifestyle attributes of the Company’s brands and products. Components of brand-specific marketing plans vary and may include print and radio advertising, search engine optimization, social networking sites, event sponsorships, in-store point-of-purchase displays, promotional materials and sales and technical assistance.
In addition to the Company’s internal marketing efforts, each brand provides its third-party licensees and distributors with creative direction, brand images and other materials to convey globally consistent brand messaging, including (i) direction on the categories of footwear and apparel to be promoted; (ii) photography and layouts; (iii) broadcast advertising, including commercials and film footage; (iv) point-of-purchase specifications, blueprints and packaging; (v) sales materials; and (vi) consulting services regarding retail store layout and design. The Company believes its brand names represent a competitive 
advantage, and the Company, along with its licensees and distributors, make significant marketing investments to promote and enhance the market position of its products and drive brand awareness.
Domestic Sales and Distribution
The Company uses a variety of means to support sales to a variety of domestic distribution channels:
•The Company uses a dedicated sales force and customer service team, third party sales representatives and point-of-purchase materials to support domestic sales. 
•The Company maintains core in-stock inventories to service department stores, national chains, specialty retailers, catalog retailers, independent retailers, uniform outlets and its own consumer-direct business.
•The Company uses volume direct programs to ship products to retail customers and to provide products at competitive prices to service major retail, catalog, mass merchant and government customers.
•The Company also operates brick and mortar retail stores and eCommerce sites. 
International Operations and Global Licensing
The Company’s foreign-sourced revenue is generated from a combination of (i) sales of branded footwear and apparel through the Company’s owned operations in Canada, the United Kingdom and certain countries in continental Europe and Asia-Pacific; (ii) revenue from third-party distributors for certain markets and businesses; (iii) revenue from a network of third-party licensees; and (iv) revenue and income from joint ventures that market the Company’s branded products in Mexico, Colombia and China. The Company’s international owned operations are located in markets where the Company believes it can gain a strategic advantage by directly controlling the sale of its products into retail accounts. License and distribution arrangements enable the Company to generate sales in other markets without the capital commitment required to maintain related foreign operations, employees, inventories or localized marketing programs. The Company believes that joint ventures will provide it with a more meaningful ownership stake and near-term brand impact in fast-growing markets than its traditional licensee and distributor arrangements.
The Company continues to develop its international network of third-party licensees and distributors to market its branded products. The Company assists its licensees in designing products that are appropriate to each foreign market, yet consistent with global brand positioning. Pursuant to license or distribution agreements, third-party licensees and distributors either purchase goods directly from the Company and authorized third-party manufacturers or manufacture branded products themselves, consistent with Company standards. Distributors and licensees are responsible for independently marketing and distributing the Company’s branded products in their respective territories, with product and marketing support from the Company.
Manufacturing and Sourcing
The Company directly controls the majority of the units of footwear and apparel sourced under the Company’s brand names. The Company’s licensees directly control the balance. Substantially all of the units sourced by the Company are procured from numerous third-party manufacturers in the Asia Pacific region. The Company maintains offices in the Asia Pacific region to develop and facilitate sourcing strategies. The Company has established guidelines for each of its third-party manufacturers in order to monitor product quality, labor practices and financial viability. The Company has adopted “Engagement Criteria for Partners and Sources,” a policy that requires the Company’s domestic and foreign manufacturers, licensees and distributors to use ethical business standards, comply with all applicable health and safety laws and regulations, commit to use environmentally safe practices, treat employees fairly with respect to wages, benefits and working conditions and not use child or prison labor. The Company’s third-party sourcing strategy allows the Company to (i) benefit from lower manufacturing costs and state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities; (ii) source high quality raw materials from around the world; and (iii) avoid capital expenditures necessary for additional owned factories. The Company believes that its overall global manufacturing strategy provides the flexibility to properly balance the need for timely shipments, high quality products and competitive pricing.
The Company’s principal raw material is quality leather, which it purchases from a select group of domestic and foreign suppliers. The widespread availability of common upper materials and specialty leathers eliminates reliance by the Company on a single supplier.
The Company currently purchases all of the raw pigskins used for its Wolverine Leathers Division from one domestic source, which has been a reliable and consistent supplier to the Company for over 50 years. Alternative sources of raw pigskin are available, but the Company believes these sources offer less advantageous pricing, quality and compatibility with the Company’s processing method. The Company purchases all of its other raw materials and component parts from a variety of sources and does not believe that any of these sources are a dominant supplier.
Trademarks, Licenses and Patents
The Company holds a significant portfolio of registered and common law trademarks that identify its branded products and technologies. The Company’s owned trademarks include Hush Puppies®, Dog Likeness (registered design trademark), Wolverine®, Bates®, Chaco®, Soft Style®, Wolverine Fusion®, DuraShocks®, MultiShox®, Wolverine Compressor®, Wolverine ICS®, Hidden Tracks®, iTechnology™, Bounce®, Comfort Curve®, Hytest®, Merrell®, M Circle Design (registered design trademark), Continuum®, Q Form®, Sperry®, Saucony®, Stride Rite® and Keds®. The Company’s Wolverine Leathers Division markets its pigskin leathers under the trademarks Wolverine Warrior Leather®, Weather Tight® and All Season Weather Leathers™. The Company has footwear marketing and distribution rights under the Cat® and Harley-Davidson® trademarks pursuant to license arrangements with the respective trademark owners. The Cat® license term runs through December 31, 2024 and the Harley-Davidson® license term runs through December 31, 2022. Both licenses are subject to early termination for breach.
The Company believes that consumers identify its products by the Company’s trademarks and that its trademarks are valuable assets. The Company has a policy of registering its primary trademarks and vigorously defending its trademarks against infringement or other threats whenever practicable. The Company also holds many design and utility patents, copyrights and various other proprietary rights. The Company protects its proprietary rights under applicable laws.
Seasonality
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s business was subject to seasonal influences that could cause significant differences in revenue, earnings and cash flows from quarter to quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in consumer behavior and preferences in fiscal 2020 that have negatively impacted the Company's fiscal 2020 results. The Company expects the seasonal cadence that the Company experienced historically may continue to be affected as a result of these changes in consumer behavior and preferences.
The Company also experiences some fluctuation in its levels of working capital, typically including an increase in net working capital requirements near the end of the first and third fiscal quarters. The Company meets its working capital requirements through internal operating cash flows and, as needed, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, included in its Amended Senior Credit Facility as discussed in more detail under the caption "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 7: "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations".
Competition
The Company markets its footwear and apparel lines in a highly competitive and fragmented environment. The Company competes with numerous domestic and international footwear marketers, some of whom are larger and have greater resources than the Company. Product performance and quality, including technological improvements, product identity, competitive pricing, ability to control costs and ability to adapt to style changes are all important elements of competition in the footwear and apparel markets served by the Company. The footwear and apparel industries are subject to changes in consumer preferences. The Company strives to maintain its competitive position through promotions designed to increase brand awareness, manufacturing and sourcing efficiencies, and the style, comfort and value of its products. Future sales by the Company will be affected by its continued ability to sell its products at competitive prices and to meet shifts in consumer preferences.
Because of the lack of reliable published statistics, the Company is unable to state with certainty its competitive position in the overall footwear and apparel industries. The non-athletic footwear and apparel markets are highly fragmented and no one company has a dominant market position.
Environmental Matters
The Company uses and generates certain substances and wastes that are regulated or may be deemed hazardous to the environment under certain federal, state and local regulations. The Company works with foreign and domestic federal, state and local agencies from time to time to resolve cleanup issues at various affected sites and other regulatory issues. Financial information regarding the Company’s environmental remediation activities is found in Note 17 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Environmental, Health, & Safety Council is composed of representatives from across the Company and coordinates health and safety matters on a real time basis. The Company's focus on the health and safety of its workforce is also evidenced by the actions it has taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe, including:
•Increasing employees' work from home flexibility;
•Adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay home;
•Increasing cleaning protocols;

The Company distributes its products to a variety of customers, many of which are deemed essential, including customers in the health and safety, critical construction, food and agriculture, and energy sectors. As a result, the majority of the Company's distribution facilities have continued operating since the COVID-19 pandemic began. In order to keep distribution facilities open, the Company invested in creating physically safe work environments for employees.
