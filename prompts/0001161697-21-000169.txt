ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OUR BUSINESS

KORU Medical designs, manufactures and markets proprietary portable and innovative medical devices, primarily for the ambulatory infusion market as governed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) quality and regulatory system and international standards for quality system management. Our development and marketing focus is primarily concentrated on our mechanical infusion products, the FREEDOM Infusion Systems (which we refer to as the “FREEDOM System” when used with one or more accessories), which include the FREEDOM60® Syringe Driver, the FreedomEdge® Syringe Driver, HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets™ and Precision Flow Rate Tubing™.
OUR MISSION

Our mission is to improve the quality of life of patients around the world by delivering innovative, effective, and easy-to-use drug delivery systems that can be used at home or alternate site settings. 
OUR STRATEGY

We plan to become the preferred drug delivery partner for specific infusion therapies in select markets. We intend to accomplish this objective by building on the market leading position of our FREEDOM® 60 Syringe Infusion System that allows for the self-administration of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (“SCIg”) to treat Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (“PIDD”), Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (“CIDP”), and other disease states.

We have identified and intend to capitalize on multiple industry growth drivers, including a growing demand for and accelerating development of SCIg, increasing awareness and diagnosis of PIDD and CIDP, and the ongoing shift from institutional care to home and alternate site settings. We plan to continue to support the product demand for the accelerating adoption of Cutacuig®, Cuvitru®, Hizentra®, Xembify® and other formulations of SCIg therapy.

 Furthermore, we plan to expand the range of therapies delivered by our products through a combination of (1) introducing additional innovative products and (2) forging partnerships with biopharmaceutical developers for their use in human clinical trials that could lead to their use in commercial applications. These actions capitalize on the migration of many current therapeutics from in-patient use to the global home health marketplace and the emerging pipeline of new drugs targeting home delivery through the subcutaneous route. Our focus is on user-friendly, cost-effective, and flexible products specifically designed to meet the emphasis placed by payors and biopharmaceutical manufacturers on supporting the patient journey meeting the demands of value-based health care.

Our revenues derive from three business sources: (i) domestic core, (ii) international core, and (iii) novel therapies.  Our core revenues include sales of our products for the delivery of SCIg to treat PIDD, CIDP, and other disease states that are not included in novel therapies. Novel therapies currently include revenues from the use of our FREEDOM Systems in clinical trials.

The FREEDOM System comprises the FREEDOM60 Syringe Driver (standard 60/50ml syringe compatible) and FreedomEdge Syringe Driver (standard 30/20ml syringe compatible), HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets and Precision Flow Rate Tubing. The systems are portable, easy to operate, maintenance free and do not require batteries or electricity. The FREEDOM System operates at a lower pressure than an electrical, volumetric pump and maintains a balance between what a patient’s subcutaneous tissues can absorb and what the system delivers, or what we refer to as DynEq®.

OUR PRODUCTS

FREEDOM SYSTEM

The FREEDOM System comprises the FREEDOM60 Syringe Driver (standard 60/50ml syringe compatible) and FreedomEdge Syringe Driver (standard 30ml and 20ml syringe compatible), HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets and Precision Flow Rate Tubing. The systems are portable, easy to operate, maintenance free and do not require batteries or electricity. The FREEDOM System operates at a lower pressure than an electrical, volumetric pump and maintains a balance between what a patient’s subcutaneous tissues can absorb and what the system delivers, or what we refer to as DynEq®.

The FREEDOM System is cleared by the FDA for a wide range of flow rates and certain medications for subcutaneous and intravenous indications, including specific clearance for leading immune globulins Hizentra® and Cuvitru® and a variety of antibiotics. 

Ambulatory infusion systems are most prevalent in the home care and alternate site markets. The use of the FREEDOM System for treatment of PIDD through SCIg administration continues to increase and remains the market leading delivery system in the U.S. for these infusions. There is an expanded indication for Hizentra® for patients with CIDP which is an acquired immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nervous system. It is expected that new SCIg drugs may enter the market. We believe the FREEDOM System is an ideal system for SCIg administration because:


• | the patient is able to self-administer in any location; 
• | the system has less adverse events; 
• | the pump is easily configured for this application; 
• | it is the best value infusion system available in a heavily cost constrained market; and
• | it has demonstrated effectiveness and safety from millions of patient infusions. 


HIgH-Flo Subcutaneous Safety Needle Sets are a critical element of the FREEDOM System, are available in 26- and 24-gauge sizes and feature unique design elements specific to subcutaneous self-administration. One such feature includes a back-cut needle designed for more comfort and less tissue damage with flexible wings to minimize patient discomfort. 

Precision Flow Rate Tubing is designed for repeatable flow rates without allowing unrestricted flow. The tubing regulates the flow rate and infusion time for various applications when used with the FREEDOM System. Each tubing set provides a different level of flow restriction and consistently delivers medication with low residual volume to minimize drug waste.

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION

The FREEDOM System is sold through both direct sales and medical device distributors to specialty pharmacy customers and home infusion providers.  Our products and those of our competitors are sold principally through a small number of distributors so our specialty pharmacy customers receive the benefit of remote inventory management and one-stop shopping.  We sell most of our products through two distributors in the U.S. and two distributors outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, these four distributors comprised approximately 69% of our net revenues with one of our U.S. distributors contributing approximately 51%.

 Specialty pharmacies, home infusion providers, and distributors are our primary call points, although we provide education and training materials to clinicians, patients and patient advocates both in the field and online.

MANUFACTURING AND RAW MATERIALS

We perform product assembly, calibration, pre- and post-assembly quality control inspection and testing, and final packaging for all of our products at our Chester, NY facility. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into an agreement with Command Medical Products, Inc. (“Command”), to manufacture and supply the Company’s subassemblies, needle sets and tubing products for supply continuity and cost savings.

Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our products. All of the components that go into the manufacturing of our products and accessories are sourced from third-party suppliers, and some of these components are single sourced including molded plastic parts from a supplier in Taiwan and tubing from Natvar, a Tekni-Plex Co., Inc.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We recognize the importance of innovation to our long-term success and are committed to research and new product development activities. Our product development team along with outside engineering resources is engaged in continuously improving existing product performance and researching new product opportunities to enhance our product portfolio. We spent $1.3 million and $0.7 million on research and development for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We intend to make additional investments in research and development over the next twelve months.
REGULATORY

Our medical devices and technologies, as well as our business activities, are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement, principally by the FDA, and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. 

The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices in the U.S. to assure the safety and effectiveness of medical products for their intended use. Thus, both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under the FDA. For instance, all medical devices marketed in the U.S. must be manufactured in accordance with the FDA’s quality system regulations (“QSRs”). Accordingly, our facility and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Federal Trade Commission also regulates the advertising of our products. Further, we are subject to laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse, which subject our sales and marketing, training and other practices to government scrutiny.

Our business is also affected by patient privacy laws and government payor cost containment initiatives, as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations.

U.S. Device Classification and Clearance

Except where an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), also known as a 510(k) clearance, or approval of a pre-market approval (“PMA”) application. For example, the use of our FREEDOM System with therapies not covered by the existing FDA clearance will require additional 510(k) clearance or PMA approval.

Under the 510(k) process, applicants must demonstrate to the FDA that a device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device, known as the “predicate” device. Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k), and these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) regulations. The FDA must issue a substantial equivalence determination before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that will not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) submissions. Changes that will significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device will require a new 510(k) prior to marketing of the modified device.
 Notably, the FDA has announced its intention to pursue comprehensive reforms to its current 510(k) clearance pathway and to its post-market safety monitoring process. We cannot predict with any certainty how these reforms may impact our business. See “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.”

- 5 -

 Under the PMA application process, the applicant must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices, and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in conformance with IDE regulations. The FDA will approve a PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose, and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the QSRs. For novel technologies, the FDA will seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts regarding the safety and effectiveness of, and their benefit-risk analysis for the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process, though both processes can be expensive and lengthy, and requires payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.

We are also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where we commercialize products before we can launch or maintain new products on the market. Many countries that previously did not have medical device regulations, or had minimal regulations, are now introducing them. 

International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Additionally, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China, for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.

Post-Approval Regulation

Even after a device is cleared or approved by FDA for marketing, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record-keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order repair, replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FFDCA and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. In addition, FDA and other governmental agencies such as the Department of Justice can take action against a company that promotes “off-label” uses. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company’s ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to a company’s business practices and operations.

Manufacturing Regulation

We must also comply with FDA and foreign agency regulations governing medical device manufacturing practices.  The FDA and foreign agencies require manufacturers to register their establishments, and they monitor compliance with device manufacturing requirements through inspections of manufacturing facilities.  If an inspector observes conditions that might be violative, the manufacturer must correct those conditions or explain them satisfactorily, or face potential regulatory action that might include physical removal of the product from the marketplace. We are an FDA-registered medical device manufacturer, and must demonstrate that we comply with the FDA’s QSR and Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”).

In the European Union (“EU”), we are required to comply with the new Medical Device Regulation (“MDR” or “EU MDR”) effective May 2021, which will supersede the current Medical Device Directives. Medical devices which have a valid CE certificate to the current Medical Device Directives (issued before May 2021) can continue to be sold until May 2024 or until the CE certificate expires, whichever comes first, providing there are no significant changes to the design or intended use. The MDR was published in May 2017 with a 3-year transition period. That transition period was extended to May 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CE mark required to sell medical devices in the EU is affixed following conformity assessment and either approval from an appointed independent notified body or through self-certification by the manufacturer. The selected pathway to CE marking is based on product risk classification. CE marking indicates conformity to the applicable essential requirements of the relevant Medical Device Directives and in the future to the general safety and performance requirements for the new MDR. The MDR will change multiple 

- 6 -

 aspects of the existing regulatory framework for CE marking, such as increased clinical evidence requirements and other new requirements, including Unique Device Identification (“UDI”) as well as many other post-market obligations. MDR also significantly modifies and increases the compliance requirements for the industry and will require significant investment in the near future to implement. 

We believe that our products and procedures are in compliance with all applicable FDA and international regulations.  There is no assurance, however, that other products we are developing or products that we may develop in the future will be cleared by the FDA and classified as Class II products, or that additional regulations restricting the sale of our present or proposed products will not be promulgated by the FDA or other foreign agencies.  In addition, changes in FDA, or other federal or state health, environmental or safety regulations or their applications could adversely affect our business.

Other Healthcare Laws

We are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These laws include:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation; 
• | federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; 
• | the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier; 
• | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; 
• | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain health care professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members, and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners; and 
• | analogous state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical and device companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to track and report information related to payments and other “transfers of value” to physicians and other healthcare providers or pricing, marketing expenditures and information; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.


Violations of any of the laws described above include civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of an entity’s operations, the debarment, suspension or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs and/or imprisonment.

 Coverage and Reimbursement

Our profitability and operations are subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and reimbursement policies and decisions as well as changes in private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decisions and policies. Our products are purchased by specialty pharmacies and ambulatory service providers or hospitals that typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services and products provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for our products and the drugs they administer is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Third-party payors are increasingly reducing coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare services and products and challenging prices charged for healthcare services and products. 
Environmental Health and Safety Laws

We are required to comply with federal, state, and local environmental laws; however, there is no significant effect of compliance on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We do not use significant amounts of hazardous materials in the assembly of our products.
COMPETITION AND THE MARKET

Competition for the FREEDOM System includes electronic (volumetric) pumps, elastomeric (“infuser”) pumps, and fully mechanical pumps as well as other types of pumps. Safety, ease of use, familiarity, cost effectiveness, accuracy, pressure, etc. are driving influencers of pump selection. Electronic pumps deliver drugs at a programmed flow rate. They are expensive and require electricity or batteries, extensive training and maintenance and must be programmed by a qualified pharmacist or clinician. Elastomeric pumps are one-time-use balloon type devices used for infusion of drugs in intravenous (“IV”) and surgical wound site applications. Pharmacies are required to fill them with drugs and deliver them to the patient. They are easy to use from the patient point of view but can be more costly and time consuming to fill, are temperature sensitive and have larger residual volumes than other delivery systems.

Competition for infusion devices for new drugs includes a variety of technologies and companies. No single technological approach—autoinjectors, electronic (volumetric pumps), mechanical pumps, needle-free injectors, on-body wearable pumps, pen injectors, and pre-filled syringes—will meet the needs of all or even a majority of drugs. For drugs requiring infusion volumes over 3 mL, the segment most similar to the SCIg drugs currently delivered by the FREEDOM System, the most relevant approaches include mechanical pumps, on-body wearable pumps, and simple electronic pumps. Very few of these systems have been commercialized. Obstacles to their successful commercialization include high costs per infusion, increased environmental impact, complexity for users, and complex mechanisms with multiple failure modes.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of December 31, 2020, we had 101 full time employees and no part time employees. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 67% of the Company’s workforce was female and approximately 45% of the Company’s employees in managerial roles were female. Approximately 52% were minorities (non-White) in the Company workforce as of December 31, 2020. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.

To help drive consistent execution of our business strategy, including our customer focused philosophy, and support their development, we provide training opportunities to our employees that align with their responsibilities over their career with us. We maintain a dedicated Internet-based learning platform with a broad portfolio of written, audio-visual and interactive enterprise-wide and discipline-specific policy and training materials. This platform includes a library of self-directed courses and virtual, instructor-led programs for employees at all levels of our organization. Managers and supervisors are provided training to help their employees progress in their professional development.

We believe our employees are key to achieving our business objectives. We have COVID-19 prevention protocols in place to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplace. These protocols, which remain in place, meet or exceed the Centers for Disease Control guidelines and where applicable, state mandates. 

Our key human capital measures include employee safety, turnover, absenteeism and production. We frequently benchmark our compensation practices and benefits programs against those of comparable industries and in the geographic areas where our facilities are located. We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive and allow us to attract and retain skilled and unskilled labor throughout our organization. Our notable health, welfare and retirement benefits include:

- 8 -

 
• | Company subsidized health insurance 
• | 401(k) Plan with Company matching contributions
• | Paid time off 
• | Life and disability insurance 


We strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual or other discriminatory harassment. Our employees have multiple avenues available through which inappropriate behavior can be reported, including a confidential hotline. All reports of inappropriate behavior are promptly investigated with appropriate action taken to stop such behavior.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We filed and received U.S. and foreign protection for many of our products relating to infusion systems and related components. We had two patents granted in the U.S. and nine patents granted outside the U.S. in 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had six applications pending in the U.S. and 24 applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. Expiration dates for the entire patent portfolio range from 2022 to 2037. In some cases where it was no longer deemed economically beneficial, we have allowed certain patent and/or trademark protections to lapse. In addition, the patent application process for both the U.S. and foreign countries is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual issues that differ from country to country. Consequently, there can be no assurance that patent applications relating to products or technology will result in patents being granted or that, if issued, the patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. There can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources necessary to enforce any patent rights we may hold. See “NOTE 9 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES” in the accompanying “Notes to Financial Statements” appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding our patent litigation that was settled in 2020.
