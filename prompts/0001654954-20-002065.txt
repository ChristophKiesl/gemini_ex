 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
  
 As used in this annual report, “we,” “us,” “our,” “CBMG,” “Company” or “our company” refers to Cellular Biomedicine Group, Inc. and, unless the context otherwise requires, all of its subsidiaries or deemed controlled companies.
 Overview
  
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to using our proprietary cell-based technologies to develop immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and stem cell therapies for the treatment of degenerative diseases. We view ourselves as a leader in cell therapy industry through our diverse, multi-target, broad pipeline ranging from immuno-oncology, featuring CAR-T, TCR-T and TIL to regenerative medicine. Our focus is to bring our potentially best-in-class products to market while also aiming to reduce manufacturing cycle time and aggregate cost while striving to ensure quality products of cell therapies. We provide comprehensive and integrated research and manufacturing services throughout the discovery, development and manufacturing spectrum for cell-based technologies. We have two major components to our global strategy. First, we intend on developing our own internal pipeline, focusing on immune cell therapy, regenerative medicine, as well as other innovative biotechnology modalities that can leverage our infrastructure, human capital and intellectual property. Second, we plan to partner with leading companies to monetize our innovative technologies in markets where we do not currently have a presence and may also seek to bring their technologies to markets where we have infrastructure.
 
 Our end-to-end platform enables discovery, development and manufacturing of cell-based therapies from concept to commercial manufacturing in a cost-efficient manner. The manufacturing and delivery of T cell therapies involve complex, integrated processes, comprised of isolating T-cells from patients, T cell enrichment, activation, viral vector transduction, expansion, harvest and fill-finish. Our in-house cell therapy manufacturing is comprised of a semi-automated, fully closed system and can manufacture high quality plasmids, and serum-free reagents as well as viral vectors for our immuno-oncology cell therapy products. Because we are vertically integrated, we are able to reduce the aggregate cost of cell therapies. We plan to build out our manufacturing capacity to scale for commercial supply at an economical cost. We hone our manufacturing process in our good manufacturing practice (GMP) facilities in China to achieve cycle time reduction, improve quality assurance and control and increase efficiency and early development to understand our therapies’ efficacy. Our other objective on institutionalizing our manufacturing process is portability and ease of tech transfer to other facilities and ease of deployment in future locations.
 
 Our technologies include two major cell platforms:
 
A. Immune cell therapy for treatment of a broad range of cancer indications.
 
 a. Hematological Cancer
 
 i. Chimeric Antigen Receptor modified T-cells (CAR-T); and
 
 b. Solid Tumors
 
 i. T-cells with genetically modified, tumor antigen-specific T-Cell Receptors (TCRs); and
 
 ii. Next-generation neoantigen-reactive, bio-markers based Tumor Infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
 
B. Regenerative Medicines using human adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (haMPC) for treatment of joint diseases.
 
a. Knee Osteoarthritis (Autologous & Allogeneic); and
 
b. Other degenerative and dermatologic diseases (assessing the feasibility).

 Our initial target market is China, where we believe that our cell-based therapies will be able to help patients with significant unmet medical needs. For hematological cancer we have:
 
  ●
  Finished enrolling patients for the second cohort in a Phase I dose escalation clinical study for our anti-B cell maturation antigen(“anti-BCMA”) CAR-T therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma in China. Currently we are enrolling patients for the third cohort in China. The Phase Ia clinical study will enroll 22 patients in several stratified cohorts and has been expanded into multiple clinical sites. We have submitted our Investigational New Drug (IND) dossier to the New Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for approval for the Phase Ib study and are waiting for feedback.


  ●
  Initiated first-in-human non-Hodgkin lymphoma clinical trials in China for our CD19 and CD20 bi-specific CAR-T products.


  ●
  Achieved the first-in-human milestone and continued patient recruitment in China for our Phase I investigator initiated clinical trial of anti-CD20 CAR-T targeting anti-CD19 antibody or CAR-T treated, relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and small B-cell lymphoma patients.


 For solid tumors:
 
  ●
  The clinical trial of Alpha-fetoprotein T-cell receptor (AFP-TCR-T) targeting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been approved by Zhongshan Hospital in Shanghai and our first HCC patient has been infused with our AFP TCR-T-cells in December 2019; and


  ●
  We plan to launch non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) TIL clinical trials in the U.S. in the first half of 2021.


 If the data from certain of our China-based, immuno-oncology clinical trials proves to be positive, we intend to submit IND applications with the U.S. FDA in order to conduct clinical trials in the United States.
 
 On regenerative medicine development we have been approved by the NMPA in China to initiate a Phase II clinical trial of AlloJoin®, our allogenic haMPC therapy for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, which is the first stem cell drug application approved by the NMPA for a Phase II clinical trial in knee osteoarthritis since the NMPA clarified its cell therapy regulations in December 2017. We launched our Phase II AlloJoin® clinical trial on September 12, 2019. Using data from our Phase IIb clinical studies before the NMPA clarified its cell therapy regulations, we have submitted our IND application with the NMPA for our autologous knee osteoarthritis. We have also been approved by the NMPA in China to initiate a Phase II clinical trial of ReJoin®, our autologous haMPC therapy for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.
 
 In addition to our own internal clinical pipelines, we have formed and plan to continue to seek partnerships with other cell therapy focused companies to expand their technology in the Chinese market. Our comprehensive capabilities have attracted inbound inquiries from global pharmaceutical companies seeking to improve the efficiency of their drug development process and/or to co-develop their therapeutic products by initially conducting investigator initiated trials in China, and upon verification on proof-of-concept (POC) to launch clinical trials in the U.S. and in China. We believe that we are positioned to capture opportunities from the rapid expansion of global pharmaceutical companies by leveraging our focus on cell manufacturing process improvement, which offers the benefits of improving product quality and creates cost savings. Positioned at the forefront of science, we believe our established clinical network in China will enable us to collaborate with these global firms as they seek to enter the Chinese market to develop in-house capabilities and infrastructure and to improve efficiency throughout the drug development process.
 
 In September 2018, we executed a License and Collaboration Agreement (hereinafter Novartis LCA) with Novartis AG (Novartis) to manufacture and supply their U.S. FDA-approved CD19 CAR-T cell therapy product Kymriah® in China. Pursuant to the Novartis LCA agreement, we also granted Novartis a worldwide license to certain of our CAR-T intellectual property for the development, manufacture and commercialization of CAR-T products. We are entitled to an escalating single-digit percentage royalty of Kymriah®’s net sales in China. CBMG is responsible for the cost of bi-directional technology transfers between the two companies. We will receive collaboration payments equal to a single-digit escalating percentage of net sales of Kymriah® in China, subject to certain caps set forth under the Novartis LCA, for sales in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia indications and up to a maximum amount to be agreed upon for sales in other indications. We are also obligated to assist Novartis with the development of Kymriah® in China as Novartis may request and are responsible for a certain percentage of the total development cost for the development of Kymriah® in China for indications other than diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia indications. As of December 31, 2019, we have achieved three major milestones on the technology transfer and collaboration with Novartis on commercialization of Kymriah®, specifically: process and analytical training, feasibility runs and an export license for feasibility/comparability.
 
 On October 2, 2018, we executed a non-exclusive license agreement with the U.S. National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) for ten tumor infiltrating lymphocytes patents, pursuant to which we acquired rights to the worldwide development, manufacture and commercialization of autologous, tumor-reactive lymphocyte adoptive cell therapy products, isolated from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes for the treatment of non-small cell lung, stomach, esophagus, colorectal and head and neck cancer(s) in humans. We agreed to pay certain license fees for such license, including (i) an initial up-front cash payment; (ii) a de minimis non-refundable annual royalty that may be credited against any earned royalties due from net sales; (iii) a small single-digit percentage of net sales of the licensed products, payable on a semi-annual basis, which may be adjusted downward in the event that the Company must pay a license fee to a third party; (iv) an additional small single-digit sublicense fee on the fair market value of any consideration received for granting a sublicense; and (v) a milestone payment component tied to certain clinical and commercial developments. We have a unilateral right to terminate the license agreement. Th e NCI has the right to terminate the license agreement if CBMG (i) commits a material breach; (ii) fails to use commercially reasonable effort in developing the licensed products or processes; (iii) fails to achieve certain performance benchmarks; (iv) willfully makes a false statement; (v) is not keeping licensed products or processes reasonably available to the public after commercial use; (vi) cannot reasonably satisfy unmet health and safety needs; or (vii) cannot meet certain requirements by federal regulations. The license agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire of the patent rights licensed pursuant thereto. Other than an initial upfront payment and a de minimis annual royalty payment, the Company has not paid any additional royalty under the license agreement as of December 31, 2019.

 In order to expedite fulfillment of patient treatment, we have been actively developing technologies and products with strong intellectual property protection. CBMG’s worldwide exclusive license to the T Cell patent rights owned by Augusta University provides an opportunity to expand the application of CBMG’s cancer therapy-enabling technologies and to initiate clinical trials with leading cancer hospitals. On February 14, 2019, Augusta University granted us an exclusive, worldwide license with sublicense rights to its patent rights to Human Alpha Fetoprotein-Specific T Cell Receptor modified T-cells (AFP TCR-T). In consideration for the license granted, the Company agreed to pay the university a one-time, non-refundable, non-creditable license fee within 30 days of execution of the license agreement and a single-digit percent of running royalty on net sales of the licensed products. The Company also agreed to (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts to develop and conduct such research, development and validation studies as necessary or desirable to obtain all regulatory approvals to manufacture and market the licensed products in at least one country in certain major markets listed in the license agreement, and (b) upon receipt of such approvals, to use commercially reasonable efforts to market each licensed product in such country. The Company, at its sole expense, has the obligation to fund the costs of all research, development, preclinical and clinical trials, regulatory approval and commercialization of the licensed products. The license agreement will expire upon the termination of the Company’s obligation to pay royalty pursuant to the terms thereof. Upon expiration of the term, the license granted the Company will survive the expiration of the license agreement, and convert to a perpetual, fully paid up license. The Company may terminate the agreement, in its sole discretion, upon 30 days’ prior written notice to Augusta University and either party may terminate the license agreement upon or after the breach of a material provision of the agreement that is not cured within 45 days after notice thereof by the non-breaching party. The Company has not paid any royalty since there have not been any sales of licensed products as of the date of this report.

  Variable Interest Entity (VIE) Agreements
  
 Through our wholly foreign-owned entity and 100% subsidiary, Cellular Biomedicine Group Ltd. (Wuxi), we control and have ownership rights by means of a series of VIE agreements with CBMG Shanghai. The shareholders of record for CBMG Shanghai were Cao Wei and Chen Mingzhe, who together owned 100% of the equity interests in CBMG Shanghai before October 26, 2016. On October 26, 2016, Cao Wei, Chen Mingzhe and Lu Junfeng entered into an equity transfer agreement and a supplementary agreement pursuant to which Cao Wei transferred his equity interests in CBMG Shanghai to Chen Mingzhe and Lu Junfeng. As a result of the transfer, each of Chen and Lu now owns a 50% equity interest in CBMG Shanghai. On the same day, WFOE, CBMG Shanghai, Cao Wei and Chen Mingzhe entered into a termination agreement, pursuant to which the series of VIE agreements executed among the WFOE, CBMG Shanghai, Chen Mingzhe and Cao Wei were terminated and a new set of VIE agreements were executed. The following is a description of each of these VIE agreements:
  
 Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement. Through the WFOE, we are a party to an exclusive business cooperation agreement dated October 26, 2016 with CBMG Shanghai, which provides that (i) the WFOE shall exclusively provide CBMG Shanghai with complete technical support, business support and related consulting services; (ii) without prior written consent of the WFOE, CBMG Shanghai may not accept the same or similar consultancy and/or services from any third party, nor establish any similar cooperation relationship with any third party regarding same matters during the term of the agreement; (iii) CBMG Shanghai shall pay the WFOE service fees as calculated based on the time of service rendered by the WFOE multiplying the corresponding rate, plus an adjusted amount decided by the board of the WFOE; and (iv) CBMG Shanghai grants to the WFOE an irrevocable and exclusive option to purchase, at its sole discretion, any or all of CBMG Shanghai’s assets at the lowest purchase price permissible under PRC laws. The term of the agreement is 10 years, provided however the agreement may extended at the option of the WFOE. Since this agreement permits the WFOE to determine the service fee at its sole discretion, the agreement in effect provides the WFOE with rights to all earnings of the VIE.

 Power of Attorney from Lu Junfeng. Through the WFOE, we are the recipient of a power of attorney executed by Lu Junfeng on October 26, 2016, in accordance with which Lu Junfeng authorized the WFOE to act on his behalf as his exclusive agent with respect to all matters concerning his equity interest in CBMG Shanghai, including without limitation attending the shareholders’ meetings of CBMG Shanghai, exercising voting rights and designating and appointing senior executives of CBMG Shanghai.
  
 Power of Attorney from Chen Mingzhe. Through the WFOE, we are the recipient of a power of attorney executed by Chen Mingzhe on October 26, 2016, in accordance with which Chen Mingzhe authorized the WFOE to act on his behalf as his exclusive agent with respect to all matters concerning his equity interest in CBMG Shanghai, including without limitation attending the shareholders’ meetings of CBMG Shanghai, exercising voting rights and designating and appointing senior executives of CBMG Shanghai.
  
 Equity Interest Pledge Agreement with Lu Junfeng. Through the WFOE, we are a party to an equity interest pledge agreement with CBMG Shanghai and Lu Junfeng dated October 26, 2016, in accordance with which: (i) Lu Junfeng pledged to the WFOE the entire equity interest he holds in CBMG Shanghai as security for payment of the consulting and service fees by CBMG Shanghai under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement; (ii) Lu Junfeng and CBMG Shanghai submitted all necessary documents to ensure the registration of the Pledge of the Equity Interest with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) and the pledge became effective on November 22, 2016; and (iii) on the occurrence of any event of default, unless it has been successfully resolved within 20 days after the delivery of a rectification notice by the WFOE, the WFOE may exercise its pledge rights at any time by a written notice to Lu Junfeng.
  
 Equity Interest Pledge Agreement with Chen Mingzhe. Through the WFOE we are a party to an equity interest pledge agreement with CBMG Shanghai and Chen Mingzhe dated October 26, 2016, in accordance with which: (i) Chen Mingzhe pledged to the WFOE the entire equity interest he holds in CBMG Shanghai as security for payment of the consulting and service fees by CBMG Shanghai under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement; (ii) Chen Mingzhe and CBMG Shanghai submitted all necessary documents to ensure the registration of the Pledge of the Equity Interest with SAIC, and the pledge became effective on November 22, 2016; and (iii) on the occurrence of any event of default, unless it has been successfully resolved within 20 days after the delivery of a rectification notice by the WFOE, the WFOE may exercise its pledge rights at any time by a written notice to Chen Mingzhe. 
  
 Our relationship with our controlled VIE entity, CBMG Shanghai, through the VIE agreements, is subject to various operational and legal risks. Management believes that Chen and Lu, as record holders of the VIE’s registered capital, have no interest in acting contrary to the VIE agreements. However, if Chen and Lu as shareholders of the VIE entity were to reduce or eliminate their ownership of the registered capital of the VIE entity, their interests may diverge from that of CBMG and they may seek to act in a manner contrary to the VIE agreements (for example by controlling the VIE entity in such a way that is inconsistent with the directives of CBMG management and the board; or causing non-payment by the VIE entity of services fees). If such circumstances were to occur the WFOE would have to assert control rights through the powers of attorney and other VIE agreements, which would require legal action through the PRC judicial system. While we believe the VIE agreements are legally enforceable in the PRC, there is a risk that enforcement of these agreements may involve more extensive procedures and costs to enforce, in comparison to direct equity ownership of the VIE entity. We believe based on the advice of local counsel that the VIE agreements are valid and in compliance with PRC laws presently in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable PRC laws were to change or are interpreted by authorities in the future in a manner which challenges or renders the VIE agreements ineffective, the WFOE’s ability to control and obtain all benefits (economic or otherwise) of ownership of the VIE entity could be impaired or eliminated. In the event of such future changes or new interpretations of PRC law, in an effort to substantially preserve our rights we may have to either amend our VIE agreements or enter into alternative arrangements which comply with PRC laws as interpreted and then in effect.
  
 For further discussion of risks associated with the above, please see Item 1A – Risk Factors under the subheading “Risks Related to Our Structure.”

  BIOPHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS
  
 The biopharmaceutical business was founded in 2009 by a team of seasoned Chinese-American executives, scientists and doctors. In 2010, we established a facility designed and built to comply with China’s GMP standards in Wuxi, China, and in 2012, we established a U.S. FDA compliant manufacturing facility in Shanghai. In November 2017, we opened our Zhangjiang facility in Shanghai, of which 40,000 square feet, or 35% of the total facility, was designed and built to GMP standards and dedicated to advanced cell manufacturing. Our focus has been to serve the rapidly growing health care market initially in China by marketing and commercializing immune cell and stem cell therapeutics, related tools and products from our patent-protected homegrown and acquired cell technology, as well as by utilizing in-licensed and other acquired intellectual properties before shifting our attention to serve the mature and highly competitive health care market in the U.S. We continue to explore new products and gene therapies that may require the investment of a material amount of assets.
 
 Our current treatment focal points are cancer and KOA.
 
 Cancer. We are focusing our clinical development efforts on B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-specific, and CD20 CAR-T therapies, T-cells with genetically engineered T-cell receptor (TCR-Ts) and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) technologies. As discussed above in Item 1 – Business, under the subheading “Overview,” we entered into the Novartis LCA in September of 2018. With the execution of the Novartis LCA, we have prioritized our efforts on working with Novartis to bring Kymriah® to patients in China as soon as practicable. In light of our collaboration with Novartis, we will no longer pursue our own ALL and DLBCL biologics license application submission with the NMPA. On the research and development side, we seek to bring our CD22 CAR-T, CD20 CAR-T for CD19 CAR-T Relapsing NHL, CD19-CD20 bispecific CAR-T product, BCMA CAR-T for Multiple Myeloma (MM), NKG2D CAR-T for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), AFP TCR-T for HCC and neoantigen reactive TIL on solid tumors, respectively, in first-in-human trial as soon as possible. We plan to continue leveraging our cutting-edge Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC) platform, as well as our Quality Management System and our strong scientific expertise in the U.S and in China, to collaborate with multinational pharmaceutical companies to co-develop cell therapies in China.
 
 KOA. In 2013, we completed a Phase I/IIa clinical study, in China, for our KOA therapy named ReJoin®. The trial tested the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injections of autologous haMPCs in order to reduce inflammation and repair damaged joint cartilage. Since 2013, we have continued clinical studies on ReJoin® and our trial data has demonstrated positive results on the performance of ReJoin®. Our ReJoin® human adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cell (haMPC) therapy for KOA is an interventional therapy using our proprietary process, culture and medium.
 
 Our process is distinguishable from sole Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) therapy. The immunophenotype of our haMPCs exhibited a homogenous population expressing multiple biomarkers such as CD73+, CD90+, CD105+, HLA-DR-, CD14-, CD34- and CD45-. In contrast, SVF is merely a heterogeneous fraction including preadipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, macrophages, fibroblasts and adipose-derived stem cells.
 
 In January 2016, we launched the Allogeneic KOA Phase I Trial in China to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AlloJoin®, an off-the-shelf allogeneic adipose derived progenitor cell (haMPC) therapy for the treatment of KOA. On August 5, 2016, we completed patient treatment for the Allogeneic KOA Phase I trial, and on December 9, 2016, we announced interim three-month safety data from the Allogenic KOA Phase I Trial in China. The interim analysis of the trial has demonstrated a preliminary safety and tolerability profile of AlloJoin® in the three doses tested, and no serious adverse events (SAE) have been observed. On March 16, 2018, we announced a positive 48-week AlloJoin® Phase I data in China, which demonstrated good safety and early efficacy for the slowing of cartilage deterioration. China finalized its cell therapy regulatory pathway in December 2017. Our AlloJoin® IND application to conduct a Phase II clinical trial with the NMPA was been approved in January 2019 and we launched our Phase II AlloJoin® clinical trial on September 12, 2019. On September 27, 2019, we received the ReJoin® therapy application acceptance for Phase II clinical trials by the NMPA.
 
 We established adult adipose-derived progenitor cell and immuno-oncology cellular therapy platforms in treating specific medical conditions and diseases. Our Quality Management Systems (QMS) have been assessed and certified to meet the requirements of ISO 9001: 2015, and a quality manual based on GMP guidelines has been finalized. The facilities, utilities and equipment in both Zhangjiang and Wuxi Sites have been calibrated and/or qualified and in compliance with requirements of local health authorities. We installed an Enterprise Quality Management System (EQMS) in April 2019 to facilitate the quality activities. A document management system and Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) will be installed and qualified in early 2020.
 
 Our proprietary manufacturing processes and procedures include (i) banking of allogenic cellular product and intermediate product; (ii) manufacturing process of GMP-grade viral vectors; (iii) manufacturing process of GMP-grade cellular product; and (iv) analytical testing to ensure the safety, identity, purity and potency of cellular products.
 
  Recent Developments in Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy (ACT)
  
 The immune system plays an essential role in cancer development and growth. In the past decade, immune checkpoint blockade has demonstrated a major breakthrough in cancer treatment and has currently been approved for the treatment of multiple tumor types. Adoptive immune cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) or gene-modified T-cells expressing novel T cell receptors (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) is another strategy to modify the immune system to recognize tumor cells and thus carry out an anti-tumor effector function.
 
 The TILs consist of tumor-resident T-cells which are isolated and expanded ex vivo after surgical resection of the tumor. Thereafter, the TILs are further expanded in a rapid expansion protocol (REP). Before intravenous adoptive transfer into the patient, the patient is treated with a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen. TCR gene therapy and CAR gene therapy are ACT with genetically modified peripheral blood T-cells. For both treatment modalities, peripheral blood T-cells are isolated via leukapheresis. These T-cells are then transduced by viral vectors to either express a specific TCR or CAR. These treatments have shown promising results in various tumor types.

  CAR-Ts
 
 According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute’s 2013 cancer topics research update on CAR-T-Cells, excitement is growing for immunotherapy—therapies that harness the power of a patient’s immune system to combat their disease, or what some in the research community are calling the “fifth pillar” of cancer treatment.
  
 One approach to immunotherapy involves engineering patients’ own immune cells to recognize and attack their tumors. This approach is called adoptive cell transfer (ACT). ACT’s building blocks are T cells, a type of immune cell collected from the patient’s own blood. One of the well-established ACT approaches is CAR-T cancer therapy. After collection, the T-cells are genetically engineered to produce special receptors on their surface called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs are proteins that allow the T-cells to recognize a specific protein (antigen) on tumor cells. These engineered CAR-T-cells are then grown until the number reaches dose level. The expanded population of CAR-T-cells is then infused into the patient. After the infusion, if all goes as planned, the T-cells multiply in the patient’s body and, with guidance from their engineered receptor, recognize and kill cancer cells that harbor the antigen on their surfaces. This process builds on a similar form of ACT pioneered from NCI’s Surgery Branch for patients with advanced melanoma. In 2013, NCI’s Pediatric Oncology Branch commented that the CAR-T-cells are much more potent than anything they can achieve with other immuno-based treatments being studied. Although investigators working in this field caution that there is still much to learn about CAR T-cell therapy, the early results from trials like these have generated considerable optimism.
  
 CAR-T cell therapies, such as anti-CD19 CAR-T and anti-BCMA CAR-T, have been tested in several hematological indications on patients that are refractory/relapsing to chemotherapy, and many of them have relapsed after stem cell transplantation. All of these patients had limited treatment options prior to CAR-T therapy. CAR-T has shown encouraging clinical efficacy in many of these patients, and some of them have had durable clinical response for years. However, some adverse effects, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological toxicity, have been observed in patients treated with CAR-T-cells. For example, in July 2016, Juno Therapeutics, Inc. reported the death of patients enrolled in the U.S. Phase II clinical trial of JCAR015 (anti-CD19 CAR-T) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The U.S. FDA put the trial on hold and lifted the hold within a week after Juno provided a satisfactory explanation and solution. Juno attributed the cause of patient deaths to the use of Fludarabine preconditioning and they switched to use only cyclophosphamide pre-conditioning in subsequent enrollment.
  
 In August 2017, the U.S. FDA approved Novartis’ Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) a CD19-targeted CAR-T therapy, for the treatment of patients up to 25 years old for relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common cancer in children. Current treatments show a rate of 80% remission using intensive chemotherapy. However, there are almost no conventional treatments to help patients who have relapsed or are refractory to traditional treatment. Kymriah® has shown results of complete and long lasting remission, and was the first U.S. FDA-approved CAR-T therapy. In October 2017, the U.S. FDA approved Kite Pharmaceuticals’ (Gilead) CAR-T therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) the most common type of NHL in adults. The initial results of axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta), the prognosis of high-grade chemo refractory NHL, is dismal with a medium survival time of a few weeks. Yescarta is a therapy for patients who have not responded to or who have relapsed after at least two other kinds of treatment.
  
 In May 2018, the U.S. FDA approved Novartis’ Kymriah® for intravenous infusion for its second indication—the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, high grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma. Kymriah® is now the only CAR-T cell therapy to receive U.S. FDA approval for two distinct indications in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and B-cell ALL. On September 25, 2018, we entered into the Novartis LCA with Novartis to manufacture and supply Kymriah® to Novartis in China.
  
 Besides anti-CD19 CAR-T, anti-BCMA CAR-T has shown promising clinical efficacy in treatment of multiple myeloma. For example, bb2121, a CAR-T therapy targeting BCMA, has been developed by Bluebird bio, Inc. and Celgene for previously treated patients with multiple myeloma. Based on preliminary clinical data from the ongoing Phase I study CRB-401, bb2121 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. FDA and PRIME eligibility by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in November 2017. We plan to initiate our anti-BCMA CAR-T investigator initiated trial in the near future.
  
 Recent progress in Universal Chimeric Antigen Receptor (UCAR) T-cells showed benefits such as ease of use, availability and the drug pricing challenge. Currently, most therapeutic UCAR products are being developed with gene editing platforms such as CRISPR or TALEN. For example, UCART19 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate developed by Cellectis for treatment of CD19-expressing hematological malignancies. UCART19 Phase I clinical trials started in adult and pediatric patients in Europe in June 2016 and in the U.S. in 2017. The use of UCAR may has the potential to overcome the limitation of the current autologous approach by providing an allogeneic, frozen, “off-the-shelf” T-cell product for cancer treatment.
  
  TILs
 
 While CAR-T cell therapy has proven successful in treatment of several hematological malignancies, other cell therapy approaches, including Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) are being developed to treat solid tumors. For example, Iovance Biotherapeutics is focused on the development of autologous tumor-directed TILs for treatments of patients with various solid tumor indications. Iovance is conducting several Phase II clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety of autologous TIL for treatment of patients with Metastatic Melanoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Cervical Cancer in the U.S. and Europe.

  TCRs
 
 Adaptimmune is partnering with GlaxoSmithKline to develop TCR-T therapy targeting the NY-ESO-1 peptide, which is present across multiple cancer types. Their NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell has been used in multiple Phase I/II clinical trials in patients with solid tumors and haematological malignancies, including synovial sarcoma, myxoid round cell liposarcoma, multiple myeloma, melanoma, NSCLC and ovarian cancer. The initial data suggested positive clinical responses and evidence of tumor reduction in patients. NY-ESO SPEART T-cell has been granted breakthrough therapy designation by the U.S. FDA and PRIME regulatory access in Europe. Adaptimmune’s other TCR-T product, AFP SPEAR T-cell targeting AFP peptide, is aimed at the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). AFP SPEAR T-cell is in a Phase I study and enrolling HCC patients in the U.S.
  
  CBMG’s Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy (ACT) Programs
 
 In December 2017, the Chinese government issued trial guidelines concerning the development and testing of cell therapy products in China. Although these trial guidelines are not yet codified as mandatory regulation, we believe they provide a measure of clarity and a preliminary regulatory pathway for our cell therapy operations in an uncertain regulatory environment. On April 18 and April 21, 2018, the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) posted on its website acceptance of the IND application for CAR-T cancer therapies in treating patients with NHL and adult ALL submitted by the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, CBMG Shanghai and Shanghai Cellular Biopharmaceutical Group Ltd. On September 25, 2018 we entered into Novartis LCA to manufacture and supply Kymriah® in China. As part of the deal, Novartis took approximately a 9% equity stake in CBMG, and CBMG is discontinuing development of its own anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy. This collaboration with Novartis reflects our shared commitment to bringing the first marketed CAR-T cell therapy, Kymriah®, a transformative treatment option currently approved in the U.S., EU and Canada for two difficult-to-treat cancers, to China, where the number of patients in need remains the highest in the world. Together with Novartis, we plan to bring the first CAR-T cell therapy to patients in China as soon as possible. We continue to develop CAR-T therapies other than CD 19 on our own and Novartis has the first right of negotiation on these CAR-T developments. The CBMG oncology pipeline includes CAR-T targeting CD20-, CD22- and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), AFP TCR-T, which could specifically eradicate AFP positive HCC tumors and TIL technologies. Our current priority is to collaborate with Novartis to bring Kymriah® to China. At the same time, we remain committed to developing our existing pipeline of immunotherapy candidates for hematologic and solid tumor cancers to help deliver potential new treatment options for patients in China. We are striving to build a competitive research and development function, a translational medicine unit, along with a well-established cellular manufacturing capability and ample capacity, to support Kymriah® in China and our development of multiple assets in multiple indications. We believe that these efforts will allow us to boost the Company’s Immuno-Oncology presence. We initiated a clinical trial to evaluate anti-BCMA CAR-T therapy in Multiple Myeloma (“MM”) and started first in-human studies for multiple CAR-T and TCR-T programs in 2019. 
 Market for Immune Cell Therapies
 
  Our immune cell therapies involve the genetic engineering of T-cells to express either chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, or T cell receptors, or TCRs and TIL. These T-cells are designed to recognize and attack cancer cells. Kymriah is a type of immune cell therapy that is made from a patient’s own white blood cells and is a prescription cancer treatment used in patients up to 25 years old who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is either relapsing or is refractory. It is also used in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has relapsed or is refractory after having at least two other kinds of treatment. On August 30, 2017, Kymriah was approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of children and young adults with ALL. By October 18, 2017, the U.S. FDA granted approval for Yescarta for treating patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/rDLBCL) and other rare large B-cell lymphomas. On May 1, 2018, the U.S.FDA approved Kymriah for a second indication (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). In August 2018, Kymriah and Yescarta secured European Union approval for the treatment of blood cancers, including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Health Canada approved Kymriah as the first CAR-T therapy in Canada and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved it as the first CAR-T therapy in Australia.
 
  In 2019, 1,762,450 new cancer cases and 606,880 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the U.S. According to a 2018 International Agency for Cancer publication, China, as the most populous country in the world with an estimated population of nearly 1.42 billion, is projected to have around 4.51 million cancer cases and 3.04 million cancer death by year 2020. A 2018 Global Cancer Statistics Cancer Communications report states that compared (the 2018 Global Cancer Statistics Report) to the U.S. and UK, China has a 30% and 40% higher cancer mortality among which 36.4% of the cancer-related deaths were from the digestive tract cancers (stomach, liver and esophagus cancer) and have relatively poorer prognoses.
 
 The 2018 Global Cancer Statistics Report also reported that in 2018, lung cancer was the most diagnosed cancer type worldwide and in China with 2,093,8761 and 733,3002 new cases respectively. HCC is the 4th most common cancer in China and more than 50% of new HCC cases world-wide are in China. About 466,000 new liver cancer cases each year and the mortality is around 343,7003 annually in China. Chen et al. In 2018, it was estimated about 510,000 new case of Non Hopkins lymphoma (NHL) and 248,724 patients died from NHL worldwide.4

 Multiple myeloma accounts for 1% of all cancers and approximately 10% of all hematological malignancies.5 In 2016 there were about 138,509 incident cases worldwide. The United States had the most cases (about 24,407) and the most deaths (about 14,212), China was the second in both measures which incident cases were about 16,537 and deaths about 10,363. The global incidence of multiple myeloma rose by 126% from 1990 to 2016. East Asia (China, North Korea, and Taiwan) saw incident cases of multiple myeloma jump by 262%, which was the largest increase among any of the 21 global regions.6

  Market for Stem Cell-Based Therapies
 
  The U.S. forecast is that shipments of treatments with stem cells, or instruments which concentrate stem cell preparations for injection into painful joints, will fuel an overall increase in the use of stem cell based treatments resulting in an increase to $5.7 billion in 2020, with key growth areas being Spinal Fusion, Sports Medicine and Osteoarthritis of the joints. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disease that is characterized by degeneration of the articular cartilage, hyperosteogeny and, ultimately, joint destruction that can affect all of the joints. According to a paper published by Dillon CF, Rasch EK, Gu Q et al. entitled, “Prevalence of knee osteoarthritis in the United States: Arthritis Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,” the incidence of OA is 50% among people over age 60 and 90% among people over age 65. KOA accounts for the majority of total OA conditions and in adults, OA is the second leading cause of work disability and the disability incidence rate is high (53%). The costs of OA management has grown exponentially over recent decades, accounting for up to 1% to 2.5% of the gross national product of countries with aging populations, including the U.S., Canada, the UK, France and Australia. According to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS), the only pharmacologic therapies recommended for OA symptom management are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and tramadol (for patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis). Moreover, there is no approved disease modification therapy for OA in the world. Disease progression is a leading cause of hospitalization and ultimately requires joint replacement surgery. According to an article published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, approximately 505,000 hip replacements and 723,000 knee replacements were performed in the United States in 2014, collectively costing more than $20 billion. International regulatory guidelines on clinical investigation of medicinal products used in the treatment of OA were updated in 2015, and clinical benefits (or trial outcomes) of a disease modification therapy for KOA has been well defined and recommended. Medicinal products used in the treatment of osteoarthritis need to provide both a symptom relief effect for at least six months and a structure modification effect to slow cartilage degradation by at least 12 months. Symptom relief is generally measured by a composite questionnaire, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, and structure modification is measured by MRI, or radiographic image as accepted by international communities. The Company uses the WOMAC as the primary end point to demonstrate symptom relief, and MRI to assess structure and regeneration benefits as a secondary endpoint.
 
  According to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, there are 27 million Americans with Osteoarthritis (OA), and symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) occurs in 13% of persons aged 60 and older. According to a nationwide population-based longitudinal survey among the Chinese retired population, approximately 8.1% of participants were found to suffer from symptomatic knee OA. Currently no treatment exists that can effectively preserve knee joint cartilage or slow the progression of KOA.
 
  According to Alternative and Integrative Medicine, 53% of KOA patients will degenerate to the point of disability. Conventional treatment usually involves invasive surgery with painful recovery and physical therapy and replacement surgeries are typically only suggested and performed on patients in the late stage of KOA.
 
  Our Global Strategy
 
  CBMG is a drug development company focusing on developing cell therapies first in China, to take advantage of cost efficiencies, leveraging the expeditious Investigator Initiated Trials (“IIT”) process in China, publish and share our data in major conferences and scientific journals and then address the rest-of-the-world market after safety and efficacy of those programs are established. Our goal is to develop safe and effective cellular therapies for indications that represent a large unmet need in China. We intend to use our first-mover advantage in China, against a backdrop of enhanced regulation by the central government, to differentiate ourselves from the competition and establish a leading position in the China cell therapeutic market. We intend to invest and expand our clinical research capabilities by building drug development and manufacturing infrastructure in China and in the U.S., expanding our clinical research platform, hiring new talent and enhancing our existing coverage. We believe that few competitors in China are as well-equipped as we are in the areas of clinical trial development, internationally compliant manufacturing, quality assurance and control, as well as our dedication to regulatory compliance and process improvement.
 
  The key issues with cell therapy as modality are drug therapeutic index, institutionalized, scalable manufacturing and an affordable price for the patients. We believe our manufacturing platform is unique as we utilize a semiautomatic, fully closed system, which is expected to lead to economies of scale. Additionally, our focus on being a fully integrated cell therapy company has enabled us to be one of only a few companies that are able to manufacture clinical grade viral vectors in China to cater to the increasing global demand for cell and gene therapies.
 
  In China, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) only requires institutional review board (“IRB”) approval from the hospital and local NMPA approval for Investigator Initiated Trial (IIT), which is more expeditious than the traditional IND route. IITs can provide early evidence of POC for novel drugs which are more time and cost efficient than the traditional IND approach. IITs are also good ways to identify and develop novel platforms. Currently, we have our own drug development pipeline in CAR-T, AFP TCR-T, TIL and KOA. Our R&D team continues to identify additional platform cell therapy technologies to develop internally or acquire established technologies.
 
  In addition to the manufacturing of Novartis’ Kymriah® for patients in China as contemplated by the Novartis LCA and the Manufacture and Supply Agreement with Novartis, we are actively developing and evaluating other therapies comprised of other CAR-T, TCR-T and TIL therapies. We have also advanced our KOA AlloJoin® Phase II clinical trial and ReJoin® Phase II clinical trial with the NMPA.
 
  In addition to our drug development efforts, we are planning on evaluating co-development, strategic partnerships and both in-licensing and out-licensing opportunities with high quality, multinational partners. Such partnerships will enable us to take advantage of the technologies of our partners while leveraging our quality control and manufacturing infrastructure to further expand our pipelines.

  Our proprietary and patent-protected manufacturing processes enable us to produce, store and distribute ancillary media, viral vectors and cellular product. Our clinical protocols include medical assessment to qualify each patient for treatment, evaluation of each patient before and after a specific therapy, cell infusion methodologies including dosage, frequency and the use of adjunct therapies, handling potential adverse effects and their proper management. Applying our proprietary intellectual property, we plan to customize specialize formulations to address complex diseases and debilitating conditions.
 
  Currently, we have a total of approximately 70,000 square feet of manufacturing space in three locations, the majority of which is in the new Shanghai facility. We operate our manufacturing facilities under the design of the standard GMP conditions as well ISO standards. We employ institutionalized and proprietary process and quality management system to optimize reproducibility and to hone our efficiency. Our Shanghai and Wuxi facilities are designed and built to meet GMP standards. With our integrated Plasmid, Viral Vectors platforms, our T-cells manufacturing capacities are highly distinguishable from other companies in the cellular therapy industry. We are currently assessing the feasibility of expanding manufacturing spaces in new sites in both China and the U.S.
 
  Most importantly, our seasoned cell therapy team members have decades of highly relevant experience in the U.S., China and the European Union. We believe that these are the primary factors that make CBMG a high-quality cell products manufacturer in China. We have been implementing significant human resources initiatives such as stock incentive programs, graduate school and continuing education sponsorship and a robust health insurance plan to attract and retain quality talent to support our rapid growth.
 
  Our Targeted Indications and Potential Therapies
  
 The chart below illustrates CBMG’s pipelines:
  
 
  
16


 
 
  Immuno-oncology (I/o)
  
 Our CAR-T platform is built on lenti-virial vector and second-generation CAR design, which is used by most of the current trials and studies. We select the patient population for each asset and indication to allow the optimal path forward for potential regulatory approval. We integrate the state-of-the-art translational medicine effort into each clinical study to aid in dose selection, to investigate the mechanism of action and POC, and to attempt to identify the optimal targeting patient population. We plan to continue to grow our translational medicine team and engage key opinion leaders to support our development efforts.
  
 We have developed a serial of CAR-Ts to treat hematological malignancies including CD20, CD22 and BCMA CAR-Ts, which have been proved to be potent and effective in treating hematology tumors in the early phase of clinical studies.
  
  CD20 CAR
  
 CD20 is broadly overexpressed in a serial of B cell malignant tumors. In the patients relapsed after CD19 CAR-T treatment, the expression of CD20 on target tumor cells is relatively stable. It is proven to be an optimal target for treating CD19 CAR-T relapsing patients. We have developed a novel CD20 CAR-Ts clinical lead product, which demonstrated strong anti-tumor activity in both in vitro assays and in vivo animal studies. We have filed a patent application in China and have initiated a first in human investigator initiated trial with CD19 CAR-T relapsed NHL patients.
 CD22 CAR
  
 CD22 is another surface marker highly expressed in B cell malignancies especially in hairy cell leukemia. It also expresses in the patients relapsed after CD19 CAR-T treatment. We have developed a novel CD22 CARs clinical lead, which displayed effective anti-tumor activity in in vitro cytotoxicity assays. We plan to initiate an investigator initiated trial with CD19 CAR-T relapsing ALL patients and hairy cell leukemia.
 BCMA CAR
  
 BCMA is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, universally expressed in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. It is not detectable in normal tissues except plasma and mature B cells. It is a proven, effective and safer target for treating refractory MM patients in several clinical trials. We have developed unique BCMA CARs. Our BCMA CAR clinical lead exhibits potent anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. We have filed a patent for BCMA CAR in China and begun an investigator initiated trial in refractory MM patients in January 2019.
 NKG2D CAR
  
 Early studies on CAR-T therapy targeting NK cell signaling has shown promising clinical benefits. We are developing novel second generation CAR-Ts using NKG2D extracellular fragment as antigen binding domain. These CARs can recognize target tumor cells expressing NKG2D ligands. We plan to initiate a first in human investigator initiated trial with R/R AML patients.
  
 Solid tumors pose more challenges than hematological cancers. The patients are more heterogeneous, making it difficult to have one drug to work effectively in the majority of the patients in any cancer indication. The duration of response is most likely shorter and patients are likely to relapse even after initial positive clinical response. We will continue our effort in developing cell-based therapies to target both hematological cancers and solid tumors.
  
  AFP TCR
  
 We license the AFP-TCR technology from Augusta University. We are continuing our evaluation on the efficacy and specificity of the AFP TCRs to identity the most appropriate candidate for a first time in human (FTIH) study. We plan to redirect Human T-cells with the AFP TCRs and evaluate their anti-tumor activity on in vitro cytokine release and cytotoxicity assays; and potential on/off-target toxicity including allo-reactivity as well as in vivo efficacy tests in animal models.
  
  
17


 
 
  TIL
  
 Augmented by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) technology license, CBMG is developing neoantigen reactive TIL therapies to treat immunogenic cancers. In the early stages of cancer, lymphocytes infiltrate into the tumor, specifically recognizing the tumor targets and mediating anti-tumor response. These cells are known as TIL. TIL-based therapies have shown encouraging clinical results in early development. For example, in Phase-2 clinical studies in patients with metastatic melanoma performed by Dr. Rosenberg at NCI, TIL therapy demonstrated robust efficacy in patients with metastatic melanoma with objective response rates of 56% and complete response rates of 24%. We have started our development with NSCLC, and plan to expand into other cancer indications.
 Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA)
  
 We are currently pursuing two primary therapies for the treatment of KOA: ReJoin® therapy and AlloJoin® therapy.
  
 We completed the Phase I/IIa clinical trial for the treatment of KOA. The trial tested the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injections of autologous haMPCs in order to reduce inflammation and repair damaged joint cartilage. The six-month follow-up clinical data showed ReJoin® therapy to be both safe and effective.
  
 In the second quarter of 2014, we completed patient enrollment for the Phase IIb clinical trial of ReJoin® for KOA. The multi-center study has enrolled 53 patients to participate in a randomized, single blind trial. We published 48 weeks’ follow-up data of Phase I/IIa on December 5, 2014. The 48 weeks’ data indicated that patients have reported a decrease in pain and a significant improvement in mobility and flexibility, while the clinical data shows our ReJoin® regenerative medicine treatment to be safe. We announced positive Phase IIb 48-week follow-up data in January 2016, with statistical significant evidence that ReJoin® enhanced cartilage regeneration, which concluded the planned phase IIb trial.
  
 Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease of the joints. KOA is one of the most common types of osteoarthritis. Pathological manifestation of osteoarthritis is primarily local inflammation caused by immune response and subsequent damage of joints. Restoration of immune response and joint tissues are the objective of therapies.
  
 According to International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases, 2011, 53% of KOA patients will degenerate to the point of disability. Conventional treatment usually involves invasive surgery with painful recovery and physical therapy. As drug-based methods of management are ineffective, the same journal estimates that some 1.5 million patients with this disability will degenerate to the point of requiring artificial joint replacement surgery every year. However, only 40,000 patients will actually be able to undergo replacement surgery, leaving the majority of patients to suffer from a life-long disability due to lack of effective treatment.
  
 Adult mesenchymal stem cells can currently be isolated from a variety of adult human sources, such as liver, bone marrow and adipose (fat) tissue. We believe the advantages in using adipose tissue (as opposed to bone marrow or blood) are that it is one of the richest sources of multipotent cells in the body, the easy and repeatable access to fat via liposuction, and the simple cell isolation procedures that can begin to take place even on-site with minor equipment needs. The procedure we are testing for autologous KOA involves extracting a very small amount of fat using a minimally invasive extraction process which takes up to 20 minutes and leaves no scarring. The haMPC cells are then processed and isolated on site, and injected intraarticularly into the knee joint with ultrasound guidance. For allogeneic KOA, we use donor haMPC cells.
  
 These haMPC cells are capable of differentiating into bone, cartilage and fat under the right conditions. As such, haMPCs are an attractive focus for medical research and clinical development. Importantly, we believe both allogeneic and autologously sourced haMPCs may be used in the treatment of disease. Numerous studies have provided preclinical data that support the safety and efficacy of allogeneic and autologous haMPC, offering a choice for those where factors such as donor age and health are an issue.
  
 The haMPCs are currently being considered as a new and effective treatment for osteoarthritis, with a huge potential market. Osteoarthritis is one of the ten most disabling diseases in developed countries. Worldwide estimates are that 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women aged over 60 years have symptomatic osteoarthritis. It is estimated that the global OA therapeutics market was worth $4.4 billion in 2010 and is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.8% to reach $5.9 billion by 2018. 
  
 In order to bring haMPC-based KOA therapy to market, our market strategy is to: (a) establish regional laboratories that comply with cGMP standards in Shanghai and Beijing that meet Chinese regulatory approval; (b) submit to the NMPA an IND package for Allojoin™ to treat patients with donor haMPC cells; and (c) file joint applications with Class AAA hospitals to use ReJoin® to treat patients with their own haMPC cells.
  
 Our competitors are pursuing treatments for osteoarthritis with knee cartilage implants. However, unlike their approach, our KOA therapy is not surgically invasive—it uses a small amount (30ml) of adipose tissue obtained via liposuction from the patient, which is cultured and re-injected into the patient. The injections are designed to induce the body’s secretion of growth factors promoting immune response and regulation, and regrowth of cartilage. The down-regulation of the patient’s immune response is aimed at reducing and controlling inflammation which is a central cause of KOA.

  We believe our proprietary method, subsequent haMPC proliferation and processing know-how will enable haMPC therapy to be a low cost and relatively safe and effective treatment for KOA. Additionally, banked haMPCs can continue to be stored for additional use in the future.
  
 Based on current estimates, we expect to generate collaboration payment and revenues through our sale of Kymriah® products to Novartis within the next two years. We plan to systematically advance our own cell therapy pipeline and timely seek BLA opportunities to commercialize our products within the next three years although we cannot assure you that we will be successful at all or within the foregoing timeframe.
 
  Competition
  
  Many companies operate in the cellular biopharmaceutical field. We face competition based on several factors, including quality and breadth of services, ability to protect our intellectual property or other confidential information, timeliness of implementation, maintenance of quality standards, depth of collaboration partner relationships, price and geography. Currently there are several approved stem cell therapies on the market including Canada’s pediatric graft-versus-host disease and the European Commission’s approval in March 2018 for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in adult Crohn’s disease. There are several public and private cellular biopharmaceutical-focused companies outside of China with varying phases of clinical trials addressing a variety of diseases. We compete with these companies in bringing cellular therapies to the market. However, our focus is to develop a core business in the China market, with plans to expand in the U.S. market. This difference in focus places us in a different competitive environment from other western companies with respect to fund raising, clinical trials, collaborative partnerships and the markets in which we compete.
 
  In terms of entry barriers, cellular biopharmaceutical business generally requires high, upfront capital and other resources, significant financial and time commitment in recruiting experienced talents, a successful track record and solid reputation to build up synergies with business partners and emphasis on cost efficiency. Our core competitive edge is our strong capacity to cover the full research and development process of the full life cycle of a product, and to satisfy the increasing demand for timely realization and localization in China of key products already approved in foreign markets. We believe that we are able to maintain our competitiveness by leveraging our established position in the global research and development in the cellular biopharmaceutical market and capitalizing on the opportunities offered by the booming pharmaceutical market in China.
 
  To meet the overall social, economic and healthcare challenges in China, the PRC central government has a focused strategy to enable China to compete effectively in certain designated areas of biotechnology and the health sciences. Because of the aging population in China, China’s Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) has targeted stem cell development as high priority field, and development in this field has been intense in the agencies under MOST. For example, the 973 Program has funded a number of stem cell research projects such as differentiation of human embryonic stem cells and the plasticity of adult stem cells. To the best of our knowledge, none of the companies in China are utilizing our proposed international manufacturing protocol and our unique technologies in conducting what we believe will be fully compliant NMPA-sanctioned clinical trials to commercialize cell therapies in China. Our management believes that it is difficult for most of these Chinese companies to turn their results into translational stem cell science or commercially successful therapeutic products using internationally acceptable standards.
 
  We compete globally with respect to the discovery and development of new cell-based therapies, and we also compete within China to bring new therapies to market. In the biopharmaceutical specialty segment, namely in the areas of cell processing and manufacturing, clinical development of cellular therapies and cell collection, processing and storage, are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors worldwide include pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as numerous academic and research institutions and government agencies engaged in drug discovery activities or funding, in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, research and development, financial and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of our smaller potential competitors have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies potential research and development and commercialization advantages in the technology and therapeutic areas currently being pursued by us. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those being commercialized by us. Moreover, many of these competitors may be able to obtain patent protection, obtain government (e.g., the U.S. FDA) and other regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before us.
 
  Our primary competitors in the field of cancer immune cell therapies include pharmaceutical, biotechnology companies such as Eureka Therapeutics, Inc., Iovance Biotherapeutics Inc., Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Celgene), Kite Pharma, Inc. (acquired by Gilead), CARSgen, Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. and others. Among our competitors, the ones based in and operating in Greater China are CARsgen, Hrain Biotechnology, Nanjing Legend Biotechnology Galaxy Biomed, Persongen, Anke Biotechnology, Shanghai Minju Biotechnology, Unicar Therapy (Cooperated with Terumo BCT), Wuxi Biologics, Junshi Pharma, BeiGene, Immuno China Biotech, Chongqing Precision Biotech, Innovative Cellular Therapeutics and China Oncology Focus Limited. Other companies in the cancer immune cell therapies space have made inroads in China by partnering with local companies. For example, in April, 2016, Seattle-based Juno Therapeutics, Inc. started a new company with WuXi AppTec in China named JW Biotechnology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. In January 2017, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical created a joint venture with Santa Monica-based Kite Pharma Inc. to develop, manufacture and commercialize CAR-T and TCR products in China. The NMPA has received IND applications for CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cells cancer therapies from many companies and have granted the initial phase of acceptance to several companies thus far.

  The osteoarthritis industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The large size and expanding scope of the pain market makes it an attractive therapeutic area for biopharmaceutical businesses. Our potential competitors include pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Several of these companies have robust drug pipelines, readily available capital and established research and development organizations. We believe our success will be driven by our ability to develop and commercialize treatment options that make a meaningful difference for patients with KOA. Our primary competitors in the field of stem cell therapy for osteoarthritis and other indications include Mesoblast Ltd., Caladrius Biosciences, Inc. and others. On September 12, 2019, we launched allogenic haMPC KOA Phase II of the clinical trial across six leading hospitals in China with a plan to recruit 108 patients. We submitted our autologous adipose stem cell therapy (ReJoin®) KOA with IND filing with the CDE and the application was approved by NMPA. Additionally, in the general area of cell-based therapies for knee osteoarthritis ailments, we potentially compete with a variety of companies, from big pharma to specialty medical products or biotechnology companies. Some of these companies, such as Abbvie, Merck KGaA, Sanofi, Teva, GlaxosmithKline, Baxter, Johnson & Johnson, Sanumed, Medtronic and Miltenyi Biotech are well-established and have substantial technical and financial resources compared to ours. However, as cell-based products are only just recently emerging as viable medical therapies, many of our more direct competitors are smaller biotechnology and specialty medical products companies comprised of Vericel Corporation, Regeneus Ltd., Advanced Cell Technology, Inc., Nuo Therapeutics, Inc., ISTO technologies, Inc., Ember Therapeutics, Athersys, Inc., Bioheart, Inc., Mesoblast, Pluristem, Inc., Medipost Co. Ltd. and others. There are also several non-cell-based, small molecule and peptide clinical trials targeting knee osteoarthritis, and several other U.S. FDA-approved treatments for knee pain.
 
  Other companies have OA product candidates in advanced stages of clinical development. These product candidates include:
 
   ●
 Anika Therapeutics, Inc.’s Cingal®, which is a mixture of Anika’s Monovisc combined with a low dose of a commonly used immediate-release steroid. In February 2019, Anika announced that, based on their discussions with the FDA, they will need to conduct another Phase III clinical trial before they can potentially obtain approval for Cingal in the U.S.


   ●
 Kolon TissueGene, Inc.’s Invossa™, which is a combination of human allogeneic chondrocytes and TGF-b1 transfected allogeneic chondrocytes. In November 2018, Kolon TissueGene announced they enrolled the first patient in a pivotal U.S. Phase 3 trial. According to clinicaltrials.gov, the estimated primary completion date for the trial is April 2021.


   ●
 Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Ampion™, which is a derivative of human serum albumin, is described as having anti-inflammatory properties, and is formulated for immediate-release. Ampio stated that Ampion is in Phase 3 development but has not announced a timeline for potentially submitting a Biologics License Application, or BLA.


   ●
 Centrexion Therapeutics Corporation’s CNTX-4975, which is a synthetic, ultra-pure injection of trans-capsaicin. In December 2018, Centrexion announced completion of patient enrollment in its Phase 3 VICTORY-1 trial. Topline results are expected to be reported in the first quarter of 2020.


   ●
 A number of investigational nerve growth factor antibodies are in development. Regeneron’s fasinumab and Pfizer and Eli Lilly’s tanezumab are both in Phase 3 development. Initial results from Phase 3 clinical trials for each were announced in 2018. In January 2019, Pfizer and Lilly announced results from a second Phase 3 study showing that the tanezumab 5 mg treatment arm met all three co-primary endpoints at 24 weeks, however in the 2.5 mg treatment arm, patients’ overall assessment of their OA was not statistically different than placebo. Rapidly progressive OA was seen in 2.1% of tanezumab-treated patients and was not observed in the placebo arm.


   ●
 Servier and Galapagos NV’s S201086/GLPG1972, an ADAMTS-5 inhibitor, is currently in Phase II clinical development.


   ●
 Taiwan Liposome Company’s TLC599, which is a liposomal formulation of dexamethasone sodium phosphate. TLC599 is currently in Phase II clinical development.

 
  Certain CBMG competitors also work with adipose-derived stem cells. To the best of our knowledge, none of these companies are currently utilizing the same technologies as ours to treat KOA, nor are we aware of any of these companies conducting government-approved clinical trials in China.
 
  Some of our targeted disease applications may compete with drugs from traditional pharmaceutical or Traditional Chinese Medicine companies. We do not believe that our chosen targeted disease applications are in competition with the products and therapies offered by traditional pharmaceutical or Traditional Chinese Medicine companies.
 
  We believe we have a strategic advantage over our competitors based on our outstanding quality management system and robust and efficient manufacturing capability, which we believe is possessed by few, if any, of our competitors in China, in an industry in which meeting exacting standards and achieving extremely high purity levels is crucial to success. In addition, in comparison to the broader range of cellular biopharmaceutical firms, we believe we have the advantages of cost and expediency, and a first mover advantage with respect to commercialization of cell therapy products and treatments in the China market.

  Manufacturing
  
 We manufacture cells for our own research, testing and clinical trials. We are scaling up and optimizing our manufacturing capacity. Our facilities are operated by a manufacturing and technology team with decades of relevant experience in China, the EU and the U.S.
  
 In any precision setting, it is vital that all controlled environment equipment meet certain design standards. We operate our manufacturing facilities under GMP conditions as well the ISO standards. We employ an institutionalized and proprietary process and quality management system to optimize reproducibility and to hone our efficiency. Three of our facilities designed and built to GMP in Shanghai and Wuxi, China meet international standards. Specifically, our Shanghai cleanroom facility underwent rigorous cleanroom certification since 2013.
  
 The quality management systems of CBMG Shanghai have been assessed and certified as meeting the requirements of ISO 9001: 2015, including (i) the cleanrooms in our new facility have been inspected and certified to meet the requirements of ISO 14644 and in compliance with China’s GMP requirements (2010 edition); and (ii) the equipment, including critical ones like biological safety cabinets in the new Shanghai facility has been calibrated and qualified, and the biological safety cabinets were also qualified. The quality management systems of CBMG Wuxi were certified as meeting the requirements of ISO 9001: 2015, and the facility and equipment in Wuxi Site were also qualified.
  
 With our integrated GMP level plasmid, viral vectors and CAR-T cell chemistry, manufacturing and controls processes, as well as planned capacity expansion, we believe that we are highly distinguishable with other companies in the cellular therapy industry.
  
 In January 2017, we leased a 113,038-square foot building located in the “Pharma Valley” of Shanghai, the People’s Republic of China. We are establishing 43,000 square foot facilities there with 25 clean-rooms and equipped with 12 independent production lines to support clinical batch production and commercial scale manufacturing. With the above expansion, the Company could support up to thousands of patients with CAR-T therapy and thousands of KOA patients with the stem cell therapy per annum.
  
  Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2019, the total enrollment of full-time employees of the Company is 217. Among these 217 professionals, 136 have postgraduate and PhD degrees and 71 have undergraduate degrees. In other words, 95.4% of our employees have a germane educational background. As a biotech company, 182 out of our 217 employees have medical or biological scientific credentials and qualifications.

  Certain Tax Matters
  
 Following the completion of our merger with EastBridge Investment Group Corporation (Delaware) on February 6, 2013, CBMG and its controlled subsidiaries (the “CBMG Entities”) became a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) under U.S. Internal Revenue Code Section 957. As a result, the CBMG Entities are subject to anti-deferral provisions within the U.S. federal income tax system that were designed to limit deferral of taxable earnings otherwise achieved by putting profit in low taxed offshore entities. While the CBMG Entities are subject to review under such provisions, the CBMG Entities’ earnings are from an active business and should not be deemed to be distributions made to its U.S. parent company.
  
 On December 22, 2017, the tax reform bill was passed (Tax Cut and Jobs Act (H.R.1)) and reduced the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective from January 1, 2018. Pursuant to this new Act, non-operating loss carry-back period is eliminated and the loss carry-forward period was expanded from 20 years to an indefinite period.
  
 According to Guoshuihan 2009 No. 203, if an entity is certified as an “advanced and new technology enterprise,” it is entitled to a preferential income tax rate of 15%. CBMG Shanghai obtained the certificate of “advanced and new technology enterprise” dated October 30, 2015 with an effective period of three years and the provision for PRC corporate income tax for CBMG Shanghai is calculated by applying the income tax rate of 15% from 2015. CBMG Shanghai re-applied and Shanghai SBM applied for the certificate of “advanced and new technology enterprise” in 2018. Both of them received approval on November 27, 2018 with an effective period of three years.
  
  BIOPHARMACEUTICAL REGULATION
  
  PRC Regulations
  
 Our cellular medicine business operates in a highly regulated environment. In China, aside from provincial and local licensing authorities, there are hospitals and their internal ethics and utilization committees, and a system of IRBs which in many cases have members appointed by provincial authorities. With respect to cell therapies, however, the Chinese regulatory infrastructure is less established. In December 2017, the Chinese government issued trial guidelines concerning development and testing of cell therapy products, including stem cell treatments and immune cell therapies such as CAR-T cell therapeutics. These trial guidelines are not mandatory regulation but provide some general principles and basic requirements for cell therapy products in the areas of pharmaceutical research, non-clinical research and clinical research. The cell therapy products provided in the trial guideline refer to the human-sourced living cell products which are used for human disease therapy, whose source, operation and clinical trial process are in line with ethics and whose research and registration application are in line with regulations on pharmaceutical administration. The competent authority of pharmaceutical administration is the NMPA. It is further clarified by the NMPA that the non-registered clinical trial data would be acceptable for drug registration on a case by case basis, pending on the consistency of the samples used for the clinical trial and the drug applied for registration, the generation process of the clinical trial data, whether the data is authentic, complete, accurate and traceable to the source and the inspection outcome of the NMPA on the clinical trial. Moreover, an applicant of the clinical trial of the said cell therapy products can propose the phases of the clinical trial and the trial plan by itself (generally the trial can be divided into early stage clinical trial phase and confirmatory clinical trial phase), instead of the application of the traditional phases I, II and III of a clinical trial. However, it remains unclear if any of our clinical trials will be offered U.S. FDA-like Fast Track designation as maintenance therapy in subjects with advanced cancer who have limited options following surgery and front-line platinum/taxane chemotherapy to improve their progression-free survival. By applying U.S. standards and protocols and following authorized treatment plans in China, we believe we are differentiated from our competition as we believe we have first mover’s advantage in an undeveloped industry. In addition, we have begun to review the feasibility of performing synergistic U.S. clinical studies.
 PRC Operating Licenses
  
 Our business operations in China are subject to customary regulation and licensing requirements under regulatory agencies including the local Administration for Industry and Commerce, General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine and the State Administration of Taxation, for each of our business locations. Additionally, our clean room facilities and the use of reagents is also regulated by local branches of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. We are in good standing with respect to each of our business operating licenses.
 U.S. Government Regulation
  
 The health care industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in the United States. The federal government and individual state and local governments, as well as private accreditation organizations, oversee and monitor the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the development, manufacture and delivery of health care products and services. Federal laws and regulations seek to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the U.S., as well as to prevent fraud and abuse associated with the purchase of health care products and services with federal monies. The relevant state and local laws and regulations similarly seek to protect the health, safety and welfare of the states’ citizens and prevent fraud and abuse. Accreditation organizations help to establish and support industry standards and monitor new developments.

  HCT/P Regulations
  
 Manufacturing facilities that produce cellular therapies are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. FDA. In particular, U.S. FDA regulations set forth requirements pertaining to establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”). Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1271 (21 CFR Part 1271) provides for a unified registration and listing system, donor-eligibility, current Good Tissue Practices (“cGTP”) and other requirements that are intended to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable diseases by HCT/Ps. While we currently do not conduct these activities within the United States, these regulations may be relevant to us if in the future we become subject to them, or if parallel rules are imposed on our operations in China.
  
 We currently collect, process, store and manufacture HCT/Ps, including manufacturing cellular therapy products. We also collect, process and store HCT/Ps. Accordingly, we comply with cGTP and cGMP guidelines that apply to biological products. Our management believes that certain other requirements pertaining to biological products, such as requirements pertaining to premarket approval, do not currently apply to us because we are not currently investigating, marketing or selling cellular therapy products in the United States. If we change our business operations in the future, the U.S. FDA requirements that apply to us may also change.
  
 Certain state and local governments within the United States also regulate cell-processing facilities by requiring them to obtain other specific licenses. Certain states may also have enacted laws and regulations, or may be considering laws and regulations, regarding the use and marketing of stem cells or cell therapy products, such as those derived from human embryos. While these laws and regulations should not directly affect our business, they could affect our future business. Presently we are not subject to any of these state law requirements, because we do not conduct these regulated activities within the United States.
  
  Pharmaceutical and Biological Products
  
 In the United States, pharmaceutical and biological products, including cellular therapies, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the U.S. FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act. However, because most biological products also meet the definition of “drugs” under the FD&C Act, they are also subject to regulation under FD&C Act provisions. The PHS Act requires the submission of a biologics license application (“BLA”) rather than a New Drug Application (“NDA”) for market authorization. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Presently we are not subject to any of these requirements, because we do not conduct these regulated activities within the United States. However, these regulations may be relevant to us should we engage in these activities in the United States in the future.
