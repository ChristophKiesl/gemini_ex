Business Operations
 
Overview
 
In 2003, IsoRay obtained clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of Cesium-131 (Cs-131) radioisotope in the treatment of all malignant tumors. As of the date of this Report, such applications include prostate cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gynecological cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, ocular melanoma and pancreatic cancer. The brachytherapy seed form (a sealed source) of Cs-131 may be used in surface, interstitial and intra-cavity applications for tumors with known radio-sensitivity. Management believes the combination of a short half-life and relatively high-energy of Cs-131 will allow it to become a leader in the brachytherapy market, and Cs-131 represents the first major advancement in brachytherapy technology in approximately 30 years with attributes that could make it the long-term “seed of choice” for internal radiation therapy procedures.
 
Brachytherapy seeds are small devices containing a therapeutic dose of radiation used in an interstitial radiation procedure. The procedure has become one of the primary treatments for prostate cancer. The brachytherapy procedure places radioactive seeds as close as possible to (in or near) the cancerous tumor (the word “brachytherapy” is derived from Greek and means close therapy). A primary advantage of seed brachytherapy is the ability of the seeds to deliver therapeutic radiation thereby killing the cancerous tumor cells while minimizing exposure (damage) to adjacent healthy tissue. This procedure allows doctors to administer a higher dose of radiation directly to the tumor. A seed contains a radioisotope sealed within a titanium capsule. When brachytherapy is the only treatment (monotherapy) used in the prostate, approximately 70 to 120 seeds are permanently implanted in the prostate during an outpatient procedure. The number of seeds used varies based on the size of the prostate gland, the isotope used and the activity level specified by the physician. When brachytherapy is combined with another treatment method (dual-therapy), fewer seeds are used (approximately 40 to 80) in the procedure. The isotope decays over time (half-life) and eventually the seeds become inert (typically over 6 half-lives). The seeds may be used as a primary treatment (monotherapy) or as an adjunct therapy with other treatment modalities, or as treatment for residual disease after excision of primary tumors. The number of seeds for treatment sites other than prostate vary widely (as few as 8 seeds to more than 100 seeds) depending on the type of cancer, the tumor location, the prescribed activity level and any additional type of therapy being utilized.
 
IsoRay began the production and sales of Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds in October 2004 for the treatment of prostate cancer after receiving clearance of its premarket notification (510(k)) by the Food and Drug Administration. Prostate cancer treatment represents over 85% of the business of IsoRay today.
 
In late 2014, the first report of five-year clinical outcomes for patients treated with Cs-131 brachytherapy was published in a peer-reviewed medical journal (Benoit, et al., Five Year Prostate-specific Antigen Outcomes after Caesium Prostate Brachytherapy,  Clin Oncol 25 (December 2014)). In this study of 485 prostate cancer patients treated with Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds, a “biochemical relapse free” success rate of 96% was reported for low risk patients after five years.
 
Work is ongoing to employ Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds where trends are emerging in prostate cancer treatment, including the use of Cs-131 implants in combination with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT – a form of external beam radiation) for high risk localized prostate cancer (dual-therapy). For low-risk prostate cancer, studies are ongoing to evaluate the use of Cs-131 in “focal,” or sub-total brachytherapy of the prostate. It is hypothesized that low-risk patients using focal brachytherapy may achieve rates of prostate cancer control comparable to that of full gland treatment while significantly reducing side effects. (M.H. Mendez, et al., Current trends and new frontiers in focal therapy for localized prostate cancer, Current Urology Report 16, 35 (June 2015)).

The Company’s core product is its Cs-131 sealed source brachytherapy “seed.” These seeds can be inserted individually into the prostate gland until the physician is satisfied with the radiation dose delivered. The Company also sells “pre-loaded” needles with Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds inserted in them. In addition to the five year cancer control data mentioned above, a report from 2017 describes favorable long-term quality of life outcomes following Cs-131 brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer (S.M. Glaser, et al., Long-Term Quality of Life in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Cesium, 131 Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 98(5):1053-1058 (2017)).
 
Individual seeds can also be placed via needle into the female reproductive tract for the treatment of various gynecologic cancers. This effort has been led by Dr. Jonathan Feddock of the University of Kentucky. In June 2016, the lead physician from the University of Kentucky conducted two presentations on gynecological cancer patients who underwent treatment with permanent implantation of Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds. In the first presentation, it was noted that 21 out of 26 recurrent cancer patients remained visually free of cancer at a median of 14 months after implantation which equates to 80.7% local control (J. Feddock, et al., Permanent interstitial re-irradiation with cesium-131: a highly successful second chance for cure in recurrent pelvic malignancies, Brachytherapy 15 (S1)S78-9 (2016)). In the second presentation, a series of 22 women with pelvic cancer underwent Cesium-131 brachytherapy seed implantation with other forms of radiation therapy treating patients who were recently diagnosed and had not yet undergone any treatment. All these cancers were successfully controlled at a median follow-up of 16 months. Side effects using the Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds were minor and all treatments were performed as outpatient procedures. (J. Feddock, et al., Outpatient interstitial implants - integrating cesium-131 permanent interstitial brachytherapy into definitive treatment for gynecologic malignancies, Brachytherapy 15 (S1):S93-4 (2016)). Dr. Feddock and his team are continuing ongoing research.
 
While the FDA clearance granted in August 2009 to permit loading Cesium-131 seeds into bio-absorbable braided sutures or “braided strands” gives the Company the ability to treat brain, lung, head and neck, colorectal, and chest wall cancers, and gynecological cancer, the Company is currently pursuing the brain and gynecological cancers applications in addition to its primary focus on prostate cancer. The Company has also received CE Mark clearance to commercially deliver Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds that are pre-loaded into braided strands in Europe. This clearance permits the product to be commercially distributed in Europe for treatment of prostate, brain, lung, and head and neck tumors as well as tumors in other organs.
 
Starting in 2012, multiple institutions began utilizing Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds loaded in braided strands for treatment of brain and head cancers. The application of Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds loaded in braided strands to date has been primarily in salvage cases as a treatment of last resort for brain and head cancers where aggressive tumors had reoccurred multiple times following standard of care treatment. From 2014 to 2016 there have been numerous published abstracts and society presentations which have been presented and support the effectiveness of treating very difficult and aggressive cancers with Cs-131 in multiple body sites. Dr. Gabriella Wernicke’s group, at Weill Cornell Medical College at the NY Presbyterian Hospital, published four papers on the efficacy, favorable side-effect profile and cost-effectiveness of Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds in the treatment of metastatic brain cancer. (A. Pham, et al., Neurocognitive function and quality of life in patients with newly diagnosed brain metastasis after treatment with intra-operative cesium-131 brachytherapy: a prospective trial, J Neurooncol 127(1):63-71 (2016); A.G. Wernicke, et al., Surgical technique and clinically relevant resection cavity dynamics following implantation of cesium-131 brachytherapy in patients with brain metastases, Operative Neurosurgery 12(1):49-60 (2016); A.G. Wernicke, et al., Cesium-131 brachytherapy for recurrent brain metastases: durable salvage treatment for previously irradiated metastatic disease, J Neurosurg DOI: 10.3171/2016.3.JNS152836 (Published online June 3, 2016); A.G. Wernicke, et al., The cost-effectiveness of surgical resection and cesium-131 intraoperative brachytherapy versus surgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of metastatic brain tumors, J Neurooncol 127(1):145-53 (2016)). At the same institution, Dr. Bhupesh Parashar has published two journal articles on the effectiveness of Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds in the treatment of both head and neck and lung cancer. (B. Parashar, et al., Analysis of stereotactic radiation vs. wedge resection vs. wedge resection plus Cesium-131 brachytherapy in early stage lung cancer, Brachytherapy 14(5):648-54 (2015);  A. Pham, et al., Cesium-131 brachytherapy in high risk and recurrent head and neck cancers: first report of long-term outcomes, J Contemp Brachytherapy 7(6):445-52 (2015).) In 2017, Dr. Wernicke’s group published favorable results on a series of patients with large brain metastases treated with Cs-131 in braided strands. A. G. Wernicke, et al., Clinical Outcomes of Large Brain Metastases Treated With Neurosurgical Resection and Intraoperative Cesium-131 Brachytherapy: Results of a Prospective Trial, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 98 (5):1059-1068 (2017)).
 
During fiscal 2013, the Company began providing technical assistance and selling Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds for embedding in collagen tiles by physicians at Barrow Neurological Institute (Barrow) to treat malignant meningioma, primary brain cancers and metastases of cancers to the brain. These physicians from Barrow have formed a company, GammaTile LLC, and further refined this technology which integrates Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds and has resulted in the issuance of multiple patents to GammaTile LLC for the treatment of brain cancers. In December 2014 and June 2016, physicians representing Barrow presented their findings at two society conferences for neuro-oncologists. Highlights of the presentation included a new treatment delivery system of Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds to the brain while embedded in collagen tiles by applying directly to brain tissue after tumor removal. The trial presented included 16 patients with 20 tumors. The patients in the study had multiple reoccurrences of tumors following previous surgeries in conjunction with treatments with external beam radiation and had an increased risk for additional reoccurrences. Following treatment with Cs-131, 95% of the treated tumors had no evidence of regrowth at the operative site (local control). The incidence of radiation side effects to the brain from Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds (a common side effect) occurred in only 2 of the 20 treatments. (D. Brachman, Prospective trial of surgery and permanent intraoperative brachytherapy (S+BT) using a modular, biocompatible radiation implant for recurrent aggressive meningiomas, Society of Neuro-Oncology Conference on Meningioma, Toronto, Canada (June 18, 2016)).
 
In November of 2016, Dr. Emad Youssef of the Barrow Neurological Institute presented a study conducted on 13 patients with recurrent high grade gliomas (primary brain cancer) at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuro-Oncology meeting. (E. Youssef, et al; Rthp-23. Cs131 Implants For Salvage Therapy Of Recurrent High Grade Gliomas (Hgg), Neuro-Oncology Volume 18, Issue suppl_6, 1 November 2016, Pages vi179).  These patients were reported to have achieved a 92% rate of local control of their cancers during the follow-up interval. Due to the fact that the GammaTile™ treatment has displayed promising results in difficult to control recurrent brain cancers, the Company has collaborated with GammaTile LLC in filing applications to: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to clear GammaTile™ for clinical use; and a New Technology Add-on Payment to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) seeking re-imbursement for the GammaTile™ treatment in the in-patient setting. The application with the FDA is ongoing, however, the NTAP referenced herein is not currently under consideration and the Company plans to re-file the NTAP in October 2017. In the meantime, CMS has allowed properly licensed medical centers to apply for re-imbursement under an existing Diagnostic Related Groups (DRG) code that allows partial recovery of the GammaTile™ treatment cost.

Prostate Cancer Treatment
 
According to the American Cancer Society, approximately one in seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime. It is the most common form of cancer in men after skin cancer, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men following lung cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be about 161,360 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed and an estimated 26,730 deaths associated with the disease in the United States in 2017.
 
Prostate cancer treatment remains a key focus of the Company. Most doctors use the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system to stage prostate cancer. This system is based on three key pieces of information:
 

§ | The extent of the main tumor (T category); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes (N category); and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Whether the cancer has metastasized (spread) to other parts of the body (M category). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These factors are combined to determine an overall stage, using Roman numerals I through IV (1-4). The lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as stage IV, means a more advanced cancer.
 
Once diagnosed, prostate cancer can generally be divided into either localized or advanced disease. Further, within the localized category the disease can be further categorized to one of the three “risk groups”: low, intermediate and high risk. As the risk increases so does the probability of advanced cancer at diagnosis and the probability of failing treatment with cancer progression or recurrence.
 
IsoRay’s Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds are an option in the treatment of prostate cancers of all risk levels of localized disease. The diagnosis of prostate cancer – and especially low risk prostate cancer – has been potentially reduced with the introduction of guidelines dissuading the use of serum PSA screening at the general practitioner level as a means to detect prostate cancer early in men with no symptoms of prostate cancer. Effective July 2012, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against the use of the PSA test as a screening tool. As a result of the recommendation, prostate cancer diagnosis dropped by 12.2% the month after the recommendation and has continued to drop. (D.A. Barocas, et al., Effect of the USPSTF Grade D Recommendation against Screening for Prostate Cancer on Incident Prostate Cancer Diagnoses in the United States, J Urol 194(6) The Journal of Urology (2015)).
 
In 2017, the USPSTF changed its recommendation from advising against screening to the position that the decision for men between 55 and 69 to undergo PSA-based screening should be made by a man in consultation with his doctor. This change may contribute to an increased incidence of prostate screening (and therefore more prostate cancer cases) as opposed to an unscreened population – although this conclusion will await future trending information.
 
Furthermore, the deferral of potentially cancer-eradicating (definitive) prostate cancer treatments such as surgery and radiation therapy has become more popular as some men with prostate cancer have decided to “watch” the cancer using a variety of diagnostic tools – a trend known as “active surveillance.”

As such, the industry has experienced an overall decrease in the number of low risk cases of prostate cancer diagnosed due to reduced PSA screening, as well as a larger number of men who are deferring treatment altogether at a higher rate than seen historically. Intense competition in the space due to numerous established treatment options along with added entrants such as robotic surgery and proton therapy has further eroded the overall brachytherapy market share. The industry continues to focus on the significant data that supports the use of brachytherapy in treating prostate cancer. Management believes the current review of cost effective treatment comparisons with other treatment options, the aging population worldwide and the efficacy of treatment could contribute to the revitalization of brachytherapy treatment for prostate cancer in the future.
 
Minimally invasive brachytherapy such as that provided by the Company’s Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds provides significant advantages over competing treatments including lower cost, equal or better survival data, fewer side effects, faster recovery time and the convenience of a single outpatient implant procedure that generally lasts less than one hour (Grimm, et al., Comparative analysis of prostate-specific antigen free survival outcomes for patients with low, intermediate and high risk prostate cancer treatment by radical therapy. Results from the Prostate Cancer Results Study Group, British Journal of Urology International, Vol. 109 (Suppl 1), (2012); Merrick, et al., Effect of prostate size and isotope selection on dosimetric quality following permanent seed implantation, Techniques in Urology Vol. 7 (2001); Potters, et al., 12-Year Outcomes Following Permanent Prostate Brachytherapy in Patients with Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer, Journal of Urology (May 2005); Sharkey, et al., Brachytherapy versus radical prostatectomy in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer, Current Urology Reports, (2002)).
 
In addition to permanent, low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy, such as Cs-131, localized prostate cancer can be treated with prostatectomy surgery (RP for radical prostatectomy), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), dual or combination therapy, permanent, high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR), cryosurgery, hormone therapy, proton therapy and active surveillance (watchful waiting). The success of any treatment is measured by the feasibility of the procedure for the patient, morbidities associated with the treatment, overall survival, and cost. When the cancerous tissue is not completely eliminated, the cancer typically returns to the primary site, often with metastases to other areas of the body.
 
The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) contains a total of 1,547,941 patients with localized prostate cancer that were identified from 1998 to 2010. Overall, 13.4% of patients were treated with brachytherapy, with an additional 2.6% treated with brachytherapy boost, which is the addition of a brachytherapy implant in addition to external beam radiation therapy, compared with 49.8% treated with surgery, 26.3% with non-brachytherapy radiotherapy, 24.1% who received hormone therapy, and 7.8% who received no treatment. (J.M. Martin, et al., The rise and fall of prostate brachytherapy: Use of brachytherapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in the National Cancer Data Base, Cancer 120:2114–2121 (2014)).
 
Prostatectomy Surgery Options. In the radical prostatectomy operation, a surgeon will remove the entire prostate gland plus some of the tissue around it, including the seminal vesicles. New methods such as laparoscopic and robotic prostatectomy surgeries are currently being used more frequently in order to minimize the damage that leads to impotence and incontinence, but these techniques require a high degree of surgical skill. (American Cancer Society, 2016) Surgical resection accounted for approximately 44% of treatments before the introduction of robotic prostatectomy in the early 2000s and then rose to 60% in 2010. (J.M. Martin, et al. The rise and fall of prostate brachytherapy: Use of brachytherapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in the National Cancer Data Base, Cancer 120:2114–2121 (2014); J.M. Martin, et al., Use of brachytherapy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer in the National Cancer Data Base, Cancer 120:2114–2121 (2014), Duke University, International Focal Therapy Conference, (June 2016)).
 
External Radiation Therapy. Primary External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT), Three-dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D-CRT), Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SBRT), Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Proton Therapy all involve directing a beam of radiation from outside the body at the prostate gland to destroy cancerous tissue. Treatments are received on an outpatient basis with the patient usually receiving five treatments per week over a period of several weeks (up to nine). While the treatments each last only a few minutes, getting the patient and equipment in place for each treatment takes longer. The use of EBRT as a whole doubled from 11.6% in 2004 to 24% in 2009. The increase in the number of cases being treated with EBRT during 2004 to 2008 were cases that historically would have been treated with brachytherapy. During that period there was a nearly complete transition to IMRT as the predominant method with IMRT treatment increasing from 0.15% to 95.9% of EBRT treatments from 2000 to 2008. (U. Mahmood, et al., Declining use of brachytherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer, Brachytherapy 13:157–162 (2014). Side effects of these treatments can include bowel problems, bladder problems, urinary incontinence, impotence, fatigue, lymphedema, and urethral stricture.

Proton beam radiation therapy. Proton beam therapy focuses beams of protons instead of x-rays on the cancer. Unlike x-rays, which release energy both before and after they hit their target, protons cause little damage to tissues they pass through and release their energy only after traveling a certain distance. This means that proton beam radiation can, in theory, deliver more radiation to the prostate while doing less damage to nearby normal tissues. Proton beam radiation can be aimed with techniques similar to 3D-CRT and IMRT.
 
Although in theory proton beam therapy might be more effective than using x-rays, so far studies have not shown if this is true. As of the filing of this Annual Report, proton beam therapy is not widely available. The machines needed to make protons are very expensive, and they are not available in many centers in the United States. Management believes proton beam radiation is not covered by all insurance companies as of the filing of this Report.
 
Dual or Combination Therapy. Dual therapy is the combination of IMRT or 3-dimensional conformal external beam radiation and seed brachytherapy to treat extra-prostatic disease or high-risk prostate cancers that have metastasized or grown outside the prostate. Combination therapy treats high risk patients with a course of IMRT or EBRT over a period of several weeks. When this initial treatment is completed, the patient must then wait for several more weeks to months to have the prostate seed implant. The process could also involve the seed implant be performed first, followed by the course of external radiation.  Management estimates that at least 25% of all U.S. prostate implants are now dual therapy cases. 
High Dose Rate Temporary Brachytherapy (HDR). HDR temporary brachytherapy involves placing soft nylon tubes (catheters) into the prostate gland and then giving a series of radiation treatments through these catheters. The catheters are then removed and no radioactive material is left in the prostate gland. Radioactive source containing either Iridium-192 or Cesium-137 is placed into the catheters. This procedure is typically repeated multiple times over a period of several days while the patient is hospitalized.
Additional Treatments. Additional, less frequently used, treatments include cryotherapy, hormone therapy, vaccine treatment and chemotherapy.
 
Watchful Waiting and Active Surveillance. Because prostate cancer often grows very slowly, some men (especially those who are older or who have other major health problems) may never need treatment for their cancer. Instead, their doctor may suggest watchful waiting or active surveillance, terms physicians may use differently or interchangeably.

§ | Active surveillance is often used to mean watching the cancer closely with PSA blood tests, digital rectal exams (DREs), and ultrasounds at regular intervals to see if the cancer is growing. Prostate biopsies may be done as well to see if the cancer is starting to grow faster. If there is a change in a patient’s test results, the doctor would then talk to the patient about treatment options. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


§ | Watchful waiting (observation) is sometimes used to describe a less intense type of follow-up that may mean fewer tests and relying more on changes in a man’s symptoms to decide if treatment is needed. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
So far, no large randomized studies have compared active surveillance to treatments such as surgery or radiation therapy. Some early studies of men who are good candidates for active surveillance have shown that only about a third of the men need to go on to treatment with radiation or surgery.
 
Low Dose Rate Permanent Brachytherapy (LDR). In this approach, pellets (seeds) of radioactive material are placed inside thin needles, which are inserted through the skin in the area between the scrotum and anus and into the prostate. The pellets are left in place as the needles are removed and give off low doses of radiation for weeks or months. Radiation from the seeds travels a very short distance, so the seeds can give off a large amount of radiation in a very small area. This limits the amount of damage to nearby healthy tissues.
 
Iodine-125 (I-125) and Palladium-103 (Pd-103) are two isotopes, other than Cesium-131, that are currently used for LDR permanent brachytherapy. A number of published studies describing the use of I-125 and Pd-103 LDR brachytherapy in the treatment of early-stage prostate cancer have been very positive when compared to other treatment options. A study of 2,963 prostate cancer patients who underwent brachytherapy as their sole therapeutic modality at 11 institutions across the U.S. concluded that low-risk patients (who make up the majority of localized cases) who underwent adequate implants experienced rates of PSA relapse survival of greater than 90% between eight and ten years (M.J. Zelefsky et al., Multi-institutional analysis of long-term outcome for stages T1-T2 prostate cancer treated with permanent seed implantation International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics Volume 67, Issue 2, 327-333 (2007)).

Other studies have demonstrated similar, durably high rates of control following brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer out to 15 years post-treatment (J. Sylvester, et al., 15-year biochemical relapse free survival in clinical stage T1-T3 prostate cancer following combined external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy; Seattle experience International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics, Vol. 67, Issue 1, 57-64 (2007)). The cumulative effect of these studies has been the conclusion by leaders in the field that brachytherapy offers a disease control rate as high as surgery, though with a lesser side-effect profile than surgery (J.P. Ciezki , Prostate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer, Current Treatment Options in Oncology Volume 6, 389-393 (2005)).


Long-term survival data is now available for brachytherapy with I-125 and Pd-103, supporting the efficacy of brachytherapy in the treatment of clinically localized cancer of the prostate gland. Clinical data indicate that brachytherapy offers success rates for early-stage prostate cancer treatment that are equal to or better than those of RP or EBRT. While historically clinical studies of brachytherapy have focused primarily on results from brachytherapy with I-125 and Pd-103, management believes that these data are also relevant for brachytherapy with Cs-131. In fact, it appears that Cs-131 offers comparable and potentially improved clinical outcomes over I-125 and Pd-103, perhaps due to its shorter half-life. (A.B. Shah, et al., A comparison of AUA symptom scores following permanent low dose rate prostate brachytherapy with iodine-125 and cesium-131, Brachytherapy 12 (Suppl. 1) S64 (2013)).
 
In May 2017 a collaborative group of Canadian researchers published the results of a study that randomized intermediate- to high-risk localized prostate cancer to an external beam dose escalation and a permanent implant brachytherapy dose escalation (Morris 2017). These patients all underwent standard external beam radiation therapy and hormonal therapy. This study, known as the “ASCENDE-RT” study, demonstrated a significant therapeutic advantage to the patients who underwent permanent implant brachytherapy boost, reporting a 20% advantage (83% versus 63%) in biochemical relapse-free survival at nine years following treatment.


This study is the first in many years to successfully randomize a group of newly diagnosed, localized prostate cancer patients and demonstrate a statistically significant advantage to one treatment over another – in this case iodine-125 brachytherapy boost over external beam radiation therapy boost. The impact on the number of patients considered for “combination therapy” (external beam and brachytherapy) could be substantial, especially once men are informed of these study results.
 
Sexual impotence and urinary incontinence are two major concerns men face when choosing among various forms of treatment for prostate cancer. Studies have shown that brachytherapy with existing sources results in lower rates of impotence and incontinence than surgery (C. Buron, et al., Brachytherapy versus prostatectomy in localized prostate cancer: results of a French multicenter prospective medico-economic study, International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics Volume 67, 812-822 (2007)). Combined with the high disease control rates described in many studies, these findings have driven the adoption of brachytherapy as a front-line therapy for localized prostate cancer.


Comparing Cesium-131 to I-125 and Pd-103 Clinical Results
 
The Company’s Cs-131-based permanent brachytherapy treatment was introduced in 2004, as compared to the other permanent brachytherapy sources - Iodine-125 (introduced 1965) and Palladium-103 (introduced 1986). Thus, it has only been recently that the achievement of significant follow-up in patient studies has occurred for the Company’s Cs-131 product.
 
Management believes that the Cs-131 brachytherapy seed has specific clinical advantages for treating cancer over I-125 and Pd-103, the other isotopes currently used in brachytherapy seeds. The table below highlights the key differences of the three seeds. The Company believes that the short half-life, high-energy characteristics of Cs-131 will increase brachytherapy growth and facilitate meaningful penetration into the treatment of other forms of cancer such as brain cancer.

Cs-131 | 9.7 days | 30.4 keV | 33 days | 115 Gy 
Pd-103 | 17 days | 20.8 keV | 58 days | 125 Gy 
I-125 | 60 days | 28.5 keV | 204 days | 145 Gy 

 
As stated earlier, Company management believes that the long-term results already reported for Iodine-125 and Palladium-103 based prostate brachytherapy confirm the validity of permanent prostate brachytherapy, and at least comparable long-term outcomes are likely with Cs-131 treatment. A recent clinical report supports this contention (R.M. Benoit, et al., Five year prostate-specific antigen outcomes after caesium prostate brachytherapy, Clinical Oncology Volume 26, 776-780 (2014)).

However, management also believes that Cs-131 will ultimately prove to possess clinical advantages over the two other permanently implantable isotopes. These advantages include better performance in rapidly growing cancers and a more favorable side effect profile. Both advantages are related to the combination of a shorter half-life of Cs-131 and high energy level as compared to the other two isotopes.
 
The most recent clinical data was presented at the annual meeting of the American Brachytherapy Society in April 2014. Dr. Brian Moran of the Chicago Prostate Center reported a 92.6% rate of success at five years after treatment for 69 patients with prostate cancer following treatment with Cesium-131 brachytherapy (B.J. Moran, et al., PSA Outcomes in a Single Institution, Prospective Randomized 131Cs/125I Prostate Brachytherapy Trial, Brachytherapy 13(S1) S34 (2014)). At the same meeting, Dr. Rajagopalan of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center reported a six year success rate of 95.4% in 243 Cs-131 treated patients (Six-year biochemical outcome in patients treated with Cs-131 brachytherapy as monotherapy for prostate cancer, Brachytherapy 13(S1) S38 (2014)).
 
When taken together with the multi-institutional five-year outcome presentation by Dr. Prestidge and others, where a group of 100 patients from multiple institutions exhibited a PSA disease-free rate of 98% at five years (B. Prestidge, et al., Five-year biochemical control following Cesium-131 Permanent Prostate Brachytherapy in a Multi-Institutional Trial, Brachytherapy 10(3S1) S27 (2011)), a strong case for an outstanding rate of durable PSA (biochemical) success can be made.
 
Furthermore, in all three reports a significant proportion of “intermediate risk” patients (who are at greater risk of failure following any treatment compared to most prostate cancer patients) were included in the studies. Despite this added risk – 37% of patients across all three studies were intermediate risk — the three studies together average a 95% rate of success at five-years and beyond for a total of 412 patients under study.
 
Improved side-effect profile.

In addition to the cancer-related outcomes described for prostate brachytherapy, a significant portion of patients who undergo I-125 or Pd-103 brachytherapy experience acute urinary irritative symptoms following treatment – more so than with surgery or external beam radiation therapy (S.J. Frank, et al., An assessment of quality of life following radical prostatectomy, high dose external beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy Iodine implantation as monotherapies for localized prostate cancer, Journal of Urology Volume 177, 2151-2156 (2007)). These irritative symptoms can range from an increased frequency of urination to significant pain upon urination. Because the portion of the urethra that runs through the prostate takes high doses from the implant, these side effects are fairly common following prostate brachytherapy.
 
Recent completed studies show that Cs-131, with the shortest available half-life of the commonly used implantable isotopes, results in a quicker resolution of these irritative symptoms based on the shorter time interval over which normal tissue receives radiation from the implanted sources than for longer lived isotopes such as I-125. (H. Shah H, et al., A comparison of AUA symptom scores following permanent low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy with Iodine-125 and Cesium-131, Brachytherapy 12(SI) S64 (2013)).
 
A Cs-131 monotherapy trial for the treatment of prostate cancer was fully enrolled in February 2007.  The trial was a 100 patient multi-institutional study that sought to (1) document the dosimetric characteristics of Cs-131, (2) summarize the side effect profile of Cs-131 treatment, and (3) track biochemical (PSA) results in patients following Cs-131 therapy.  Some of the significant and specific findings were as follows:
 
1.      Patient reported irritative urinary symptoms (IPSS Scores) were mild to moderate with relatively rapid resolution within 4-6 months. (B.R. Prestidge, et al., Clinical outcomes of a Phase II, multi-institutional Cesium-131 permanent prostate brachytherapy trial, Brachytherapy Volume 6, Issue 2, 78 (April-June 2007)).
 
2.      Gland coverage was excellent and the dose delivered to critical structures outside the prostate was well within acceptable limits. (W.S. Bice, et al., Cesium-131 permanent prostate brachytherapy: The dosimetric analysis of a multi-institutional Phase II trial, Brachytherapy (6) 88-89 (2007)).
 
3. An abstract detailing the outcomes of the 100 patient multi-institutional Cesium-131 study was prepared for the 32nd Annual Meeting of the American Brachytherapy Society (April 2011). Notably, the PSA control rate at 5 years was reported as 98%. No other study of brachytherapy utilizing the competing isotopes Iodine-125 and Palladium-103 has reported five-year rates as high as 98%.

The advantage of the Company’s Cs-131 brachytherapy seed is the resolution of urinary side effects as pictured in the graphic below has been observed in a second study, presented at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the American Brachytherapy Society (A.B. Shah, et al). The following graph is a comparison of elevated side effect (AUA) symptom scores following permanent low dose rate prostate brachytherapy with Iodine-125 and Cesium-131. (Brachytherapy 12(Suppl. 1) S64 (2013)):
 

As seen in the plot of these AUA scores, the duration of an elevated side effect score profile resolved to pre-treatment levels more quickly with the Cs-131 group than with the Iodine-125 group. All patients were treated at the same institution by the same physicians, and the difference in the time to resolution was considered significant.
 
Further evidence of the favorable side effect profile of Cs-131 was published by a group from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) in August 2017 (Glaser 2017). This report concluded that only minimal long-term changes were noted to the urinary and bowel quality of life measures, and that men treated with Cs-131 for their prostate cancers are able to return to baseline measure of quality of life after treatment.

Brain Cancer Treatment Options
 
An estimated 23,800 new cases of malignant primary tumors of the brain or spinal cord are expected to be diagnosed in 2017. About 16,700 people are expected to die from brain and spinal cord tumors in 2017. In addition to primary tumors, metastasis of brain tumors from other body sites are estimated at over 100,000 new cases per year. The chance that a person will develop a malignant tumor of the brain or spinal cord is about 1 in 140 for a man and 1 in 180 for a woman. These numbers would be much higher if benign tumors were also included. (American Cancer Society, 2017).
 
The treatment of brain cancer with Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds now has two commercially available delivery methods, those being the use of braided strands, and braided strands sutured to a bioabsorbable mesh to apply the Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds which generally dissolves after about 45 days. Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds deliver 90% of their dose in 33 days and are therefore well-suited to use with bioabsorbable mesh, single seed applications, implantable strands, and by implantable device. Beginning in 2012, Barrow began embedding Cs-131 in collagen tiles (the GammaTile™ technique) and applying these tiles directly to brain tissue after tumor removal which is not currently commercially available. During the fiscal year 2017, there were sixty-five patients treated with Company products for brain cancer.
 
In October 2016, the Company filed with the Center for U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) an application for GammaTile™ to be considered for reimbursement under the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) system, the primary means by which hospitals are reimbursed by Medicare and other payors for in-patient services. The Company also applied for GammaTile™ to be recognized by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system version 10.
 
Both applications are proposed to track and reimburse GammaTile™ treatment should Company receive clearance to market GammaTile™ by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In July 2017, the Company announced that it had received a request from FDA to supply further information related to its March 2017 510(k) filing for GammaTile™. Company is in the process of scheduling this requested testing and plans to complete it and file with the FDA by third fiscal quarter of 2018, but there is no assurance this timetable will not be delayed.

Gynecological Cancer Treatment Options (Cervical, Vaginal and Vulvar Cancer)
 
An estimated 23,650 new cases of cervical (12,820), vaginal (4,810) and vulvar (6,020) cancers are expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2017. A combined estimate of 6,600 deaths are expected to occur from cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers in the United States in 2017 (American Cancer Society, 2017; National Cancer Institute, 2017). In addition to brachytherapy to treat gynecological cancers such as cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers, other treatment options include surgery, laser surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and topical treatments.
 
During 2016, two abstracts (J. Feddock, et al., Permanent interstitial re-irradiation with cesium-131: a highly successful second chance for cure in recurrent pelvic malignancies, Brachytherapy 15(S1):S78-9 (2016); J. Feddock, et al., Outpatient interstitial implants - integrating cesium-131 permanent interstitial brachytherapy into definitive treatment for gynecologic malignancies, Brachytherapy 15(S1):S93-4 (2016)) and presentations were presented at the World Brachytherapy Conference in San Francisco on the treatment of Re-Irradiation with Cs-131 in recurrent pelvic malignances in women who have recurrent cancers. Physicians at the University of Kentucky, College of Medicine reported local control in 80.7% after Cs-131 implantation for the recurrent patients and reported successful control of 22 women with pelvic cancer that had not had previous treatment. Based upon the positive results seen in the Cs-131 treatment of recurrent of gynecological cancers, physicians at the University of Kentucky are currently moving Cs-131 treatment into the primary treatment of these cancers. During the fiscal year 2017, there were forty-five patients treated with Company products for gynecological cancers.
 
In April 2017, the group from the University of Kentucky published a paper in the journal Brachytherapy that described the early experience with a template-based approach using Cs-131 in the treatment of gynecologic cancers. Although reporting on only five patients, the University of Kentucky physicians demonstrated the feasibility and safety of replacing a high dose-rate isotope (Iridium-192) with Cesium-131. This report builds on the earlier published and presented work that strongly suggests a role for Cesium-131 in the treatment of gynecologic cancers.
 
Head and Neck Cancer Treatment Options
 
An estimated 49,670 new cases of head and neck cancer are expected to be diagnosed in the United States in 2017. (American Cancer Society, 2017).
 
Surgery is the most common option to treat head and neck cancers. Chemotherapy is often used in conjunction with surgery or radiation therapy depending on the type and stage of the cancer. External beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy have been used together or in combination with surgery or chemotherapy. (American Cancer Society, 2017).
 
Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds allow oncologists to add targeted radiation treatment to head and neck cancers after surgical resection. This targeted radiation treatment is especially needed in patients whose neck cancer has recurred following previous radiation therapy. Often these patients cannot tolerate further external beam radiation therapy for fear of over radiating critical head and neck structures.
 
Management believes Cs-131brachytherapy seeds continue to represent an improved approach to brachytherapy treatment of specific head and neck cancers. During the fiscal year 2017, twenty patients were treated with Company products for head and neck cancers.
 
Lung Cancer Treatment Options
 
An estimated 222,500 new cases of lung cancer are expected in 2017, accounting for 13% of all cancer diagnoses in the United States. Approximately 26% of all cancer deaths are from lung cancer and it accounts for the most cancer related deaths in both men and women in the United States. An estimated 155,870 deaths will result from lung cancer in 2017. (American Cancer Society, 2017).
 
Lung cancer has historically been treated utilizing surgery, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy including LDR brachytherapy. More than one kind of treatment may be used, depending on the stage of the patient’s cancer and other factors. (American Cancer Society, 2017).
 
The Company believes that Cs-131, with its shorter half-life (faster rate of decay) and relatively high energy, is better suited for treating lung cancer in Stages I and II than I-125. The bioabsorbable mesh used in this procedure to apply the Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds generally dissolves after about 45 days. Cs-131 delivers 90% of its dose in 33 days and is therefore well-suited to use with bioabsorbable mesh. A report was published in May of 2015 describing outcomes from a series of 52 patients treated with a limited surgical resection and Cs-131 brachytherapy. (B. Parashar, et al., Analysis of stereotactic radiation vs. wedge resection vs. wedge resection plus Cesium-131 brachytherapy in early stage lung cancer, Brachytherapy 14 (5):648-54 (2015)). During fiscal year 2016, thirteen patients were treated with Company products for lung cancer, and a nominal amount were treated in fiscal 2017.

Our Strategy
 
The key elements of IsoRay’s strategy for fiscal year 2018 include:
 
Invest significant capital in sales and marketing development activities to gain more market share in the U.S. market for prostate cancer. Prostate cancer treatment represents the original and core business for the Company’s Cs-131 product. With five-year data relating to biochemical (PSA) control of prostate cancer now presented to the prostate cancer field, IsoRay intends to aggressively increase the number of centers using Cs-131 through its direct sales force and through its international distributors. Because intermediate- to long-term follow-up data is required to convince clinicians and patients to consider any particular therapy for localized prostate cancer, the availability of five-year data with Cs-131 in the treatment of prostate cancer represents a significant milestone. IsoRay hopes to capture much of the incremental market growth if and when seed implant brachytherapy recovers market share from other treatments, take market share from existing competitors, and expand the use of Cs-131 as a dual therapy option where it has experienced success. In 2016, the Company started its aggressive sales and marketing approach by hiring industry sales and marketing veterans to assist in this market development effort, including the hire in March 2016 of a Vice-President of Sales and Marketing and a consultant Director of Marketing, who, together with the rest of the management team, are developing a comprehensive strategy to expand the presence of the Company’s Cesium-131 products in the prostate market. In addition, the Company filled five regional sales positions with experienced sales staff from the prostate brachytherapy industry. In April 2016, the Company contracted with a marketing firm to design a new brand logo for the Company’s products and provide website development and a consumer-focused public relations and social media campaign, all as part of the Company’s new sales and marketing strategy. A redesigned website for IsoRay.com was launched in September 2016 that focused its message to specific decision makers including the physician, patient, family and friends. The new website supports management’s focus on the growth of product sales from the treatment of prostate cancer and the Company’s efforts to expand into brain, gynecological, and other cancers.

Increase utilization of Cesium-131 in treatment of other solid tumor applications such as brain, gynecological, and other cancers. IsoRay Medical has clearance from the FDA for its premarket notification (510(k)) for Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds that are preloaded into bioabsorbable braided sutures and bioabsorbable braided sutures attached to bio absorbable mesh. This FDA clearance allows commercial distribution for treatment of brain, gynecological, head and neck and lung tumors as well as tumors in other organs. The Company continues to sell product to physicians treating brain, gynecological, head and neck and lung cancer while continuing to compile treatment outcomes for publication. IsoRay will continue to explore licenses or joint ventures with other companies to develop the appropriate technologies and therapeutic delivery systems for treatment of other solid tumors.
 
Early clinical data support management’s initiatives into brain cancers and early stage non-small cell lung cancers. Local control – defined as success in preventing the re-growth of cancer in the immediate vicinity of the treatment area – has been excellent to date. The Company has continued to provide technical assistance and sell brachytherapy seeds for the use of the GammaTile™ system (multiple patents issued to GammaTile LLC) at the Barrow to treat malignant meningioma cancer, primary brain cancer and brain metastasis of cancers. IsoRay plans to continue to support studies and research and assist in the development of new application devices for Cesium-131. The utilization of the GammaTile™ system over the past three years has developed a product with consistent and repeatable results as evidenced by the June 2016 presentation at the Society of Neurologic Oncologists. Management intends to continue to facilitate ongoing research and development of the GammaTile™ product.
 
Support clinical research and sustained product development. The publication and presentation of speculative and real-world data contribute to the acceptability of Cs-131 in the oncologic marketplace. Discussion in the medico-scientific community of established and novel Cs-131 applications is considered a prerequisite to expansion into untapped markets. The Company structures and supports clinical studies on the therapeutic benefits of Cs-131 for the treatment of solid tumors and other patient benefits. We are and will continue to support clinical studies with several leading radiation oncologists to clinically document patient outcomes, provide support for our product claims, and compare the performance of our seeds to competing seeds. IsoRay plans to sustain long-term growth by implementing research and development programs with leading medical institutions in the U.S. and other countries to identify and develop other applications for IsoRay’s core radioisotope technology. The Company has deployed a secure, regulatory environment compliant, online information system capable of large usable databases to participating investigators.

During fiscal year 2017, five presentations were accepted at the annual meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) in September 2016 covering topics related to Cesium-131 treatment of brain metastases, gynecologic cancers and prostate cancer. The Company will continue to seek to increase the number of reports made to society meetings and the peer reviewed literature in order to seek to enhance the standing of its products in the scientific community.
 
Maintain ISO 13485:2003 certification evidencing quality control. In August 2008, the Company obtained its initial ISO 13485:2003 certification. This permitted the Company to register its products in Europe in 2008 and in Canada and Russia during fiscal year 2009.  The ISO 13485:2003 certification demonstrates that the Company is in compliance with this internationally recognized quality standard and the initial certification was valid for a three year period. In June 2012, the Company received a recertification to ISO 13485:2003 for an additional three year period, which was affirmed through a surveillance audit in June 2013.  
 
In October 2015, IsoRay underwent an unannounced inspection by British Standards Institution (BSI), IsoRay’s representative to the European Union and designator of IsoRay’s CE Marks, with no nonconformities found. BSI also conducted a microbiologic audit and a surveillance audit in November 2015 and March 2016 respectively. In March 2017, BSI conducted its full system inspection and recertification and found no nonconformities to ISO 13485:2003 medical device standards. IsoRay has scheduled a special BSI audit for March 2018 for the transition from ISO 13485:2003 standard to ISO 13485:2016 standard. This transition will move IsoRay’s quality system into the current state of the art Quality Management System. The Company must comply with ISO 13485:2016 by end of February 2019 in order to maintain its CE Marks. The Company is subject to a recertification audit by BSI every three years, two annual maintenance audits and one additional unannounced audit during each three year period for a total of four audits during each three year period. The successful audits confirm the Company’s success in meeting the standards of manufacturing and quality systems required for the Company to market its products in Canada and Europe.
 
Products
 
CS-1 Cesium-131 Source
 
IsoRay markets the CS-1 Cesium-131 brachytherapy seed for the treatment of prostate cancer, brain cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancers, gynecological cancer, pelvic/abdominal cancer, colorectal cancer, and ocular melanoma. The Company intends to market Cs-131 for the treatment of other malignant diseases as opportunities are identified in the future through the use of existing proven technologies that have received FDA-clearance. The strategy of utilizing existing FDA-cleared technologies reduces the time and cost required to develop new applications of Cs-131 and deliver them to market.
Cesium-131 Manufacturing Process and Suppliers
 
Product Overview
 
Cs-131 is a radioactive isotope that can be produced by the neutron bombardment of Barium-130 (Ba-130). To produce the Cs-131 brachytherapy seed, a proprietary chemical separation is performed that results in 99.9% pure Cs-131 isotope. Purified Cs-131 is adsorbed onto a ceramic core containing a gold X-ray marker. This internal core assembly is subsequently inserted into a titanium capsule that is then welded shut and becomes a sealed radioactive source and a biocompatible medical device.
Isotope Suppliers
 
The Company has identified key reactor facilities in the U.S., Russia, Belgium and South Africa that are capable of meeting the specific requirements of Cs-131 production. On December 15, 2016, Medical entered into a new supply contract (the INM Agreement) with The Open Joint Stock Company, Isotope, a Russian company (JSC Isotope). With the INM Agreement, Medical can purchase Cs-131 from the Institute of Nuclear Materials, within the quality standards and within the time periods specified, through December 31, 2017.
 
Due to a planned outage at the INM reactor from November 2017 to July 2018, the Company plans to negotiate an agreement in order to receive supply from the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (RIAR) during this outage. The Company has in the past been supplied by RIAR and does not foresee any risk of isotope availability during the INM outage. INM will begin re-supplying on a 50/50 basis with RIAR beginning approximately August 2018, and INM will again be the 100% supplier of Russian-sourced Cs-131 beginning in January 2019.
 
In order to maximize the efficiency of Cs-131 production from the RIAR reactor, the Company has consigned its supply of “enriched” Barium to the RIAR facility. “Enriched” in this context refers to a Barium Carbonate supply that contains a greater proportion of the non-radioactive isotope Barium-130 than is found in nature. This higher proportion of Barium-130 leads to a greatly increased yield of Cesium-131 when it is placed in a high flux neutron environment such as that available at RIAR and a small number of other reactors worldwide.


The Company also receives irradiated barium from the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR), located in the United States. For the fiscal year 2017, approximately eighty-five percent (85%) of our Cs-131 was supplied by our Russian supplier and approximately fifteen percent (15%) of Cs-131 was generated by the irradiated barium from MURR. The Company has expanded the amount of Cs-131 provided by the MURR reactor by approximately 100% beginning in fiscal year 2018. This increase in Cesium-131 production is expected to allow the Company to fill additional orders compared to previous periods.

Management believes that failure to obtain deliveries of Cs-131 from its Russian supplier, <<JSC Isotope>> (which provides supply from both the INM and RIAR reactors), would have a material adverse effect on seed production. Management has developed a three-step process to insulate the Company isotope supply from unplanned outages at the Russian supplier. Step One: management has negotiated a new supply agreement with its existing domestic supplier that will provide additional isotope beginning in fiscal year 2018. Step Two: the Company is planning an expansion of on-site services at the MURR facility, which will allow for a chemical separation to occur in or adjacent to the MURR reactor facility. This on-site chemical processing will in turn allow for a significant increase in isotope yield without incurring significant additional irradiation costs. Step Three: the Company has transferred its stock of enriched barium to the Russian RIAR reactor as a contingency in the case of an outage at one or both of its current isotope providers or at a new isotope supplier in Russia.
 
Quality Controls
 
In July 2008, IsoRay had its baseline inspection by the FDA at its manufacturing and administrative offices in Richland, WA. This inspection was carried out over a five day period during which the investigator performed a complete inspection following Quality Systems Inspection Techniques (QSIT). At the end of the inspection, no report of deviations from Good Manufacturing Practices or list of observations (FDA Form 483) was issued to IsoRay. An additional inspection of IsoRay was conducted by FDA in April 2013. Again the FDA reported no deviations from Good Manufacturing Practices and did not list any observations (FDA Form 483). In August 2017, FDA conducted an announced QSIT inspection of the Richland facility and again, did not find any nonconformance to U.S. medical device regulations and did not issue a Form 483. 
 
 In October 2015, IsoRay underwent an unannounced inspection by British Standards Institution (BSI), IsoRay’s representative to the European Union and designator of IsoRay’s CE Marks with no nonconformities found. BSI also conducted a microbiologic audit and a surveillance audit in November 2015 and March 2016 respectively. In March 2017, BSI conducted its full system inspection and recertification and found no nonconformities to ISO 13485:2003 medical device standards. IsoRay has scheduled a special BSI audit for March 2018 for the transition from ISO 13485:2003 standard to ISO 13485:2016 standard. This transition will move IsoRay’s quality system into the current state of the art Quality Management System. The Company is subject to a recertification audit by BSI every three years, two annual maintenance audits and one additional unannounced audit during each three year period for a total of four audits during each three year period. The successful audits confirm the Company’s success in meeting the standards of manufacturing and quality systems required for the Company to market its products in Canada and Europe.
 
 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also conducted an unannounced audit in May 2016. Because IsoRay ships hazardous materials on flights in the U.S., IsoRay is subject to regulation by the FAA. No findings were made in this audit.
 
Regulatory Developments
 
 In June of 2017, the Company received a “notice of timely renewal” from the Washington State Department of Health (WA DOH) in response to its application to renew Company’s Radioactive Materials License. The WA DOH acts as an agent of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and grants Company its ability to receive and ship radioactive material. The notice of timely renewal grants the Company the ability to operate under its existing license until the WA DOH conducts an inspection and issues the definitive Radioactive Materials License. This license is in effect for 10 years as long as the Company operates without actionable breaches of the license. The previous license was issued in June of 2007 and expired July 31, 2017. Notices of timely renewal which are in effect prior to final licensing are common practice in the radioactive material handling regulatory environment.
Order Processing
 
The Company has implemented a just-in-time production process that is responsive to customer input and orders to ensure that individual customers receive a higher level of customer service than received from our competitors who have the luxury of longer lead times due to longer half-life products. Time from order confirmation to completion of product manufacture is reduced to several working days, including receipt of irradiated barium (from the domestic supplier’s reactor) or unpurified Cs-131 (from the international supplier's reactor), separation and purification of Cs-131, isotope labeling of the core, loading of cores into pre-welded titanium “cans” for final welding, testing, quality assurance and shipping.
 
It is up to each physician to determine the dosage necessary for implants and acceptable dosages vary among physicians. Many physicians order more seeds than necessary to assure themselves that they have a sufficient quantity. Upon receipt of an order, the Company either delivers the seeds from its facility directly to the physician in either loose or preloaded form or sends the order to an independent preloading service that delivers the seeds preloaded into needles or cartridges just prior to implant. If the implant is postponed or rescheduled, the short half-life of the seeds makes them unsuitable for use and therefore they must be re-ordered.
 
Due to the lead time for obtaining and processing the Cs-131 isotope and its short half-life, the Company relies on sales forecasts and historical knowledge to estimate the proper inventory levels of isotope needed to fulfill all customer orders. Consequently, some portion of the isotope is lost through decay and is not used in an end product. Management continues to reduce the variances between ordered isotope and isotope deliveries and is continually improving its ordering process efficiencies.
 
Pre-loading Services
 
In addition to providing loose seeds to customers, most brachytherapy manufacturers offer their seed product to the end user packaged in various configurations provided in a sterile or non-sterile package depending on the customer’s preference. These include:

In fiscal year 2017, the Company delivered approximately 48% of its Cs-131 seeds to customers configured in Mick® cartridges, approximately 31% of the Cs-131 seeds configured in stranded and pre-loaded in a needle form, 9% of the Cs-131 seeds configured in a braided strand form, 3% of the Cs-131 seeds sold in a loose configuration and the remaining 9% configured in either a pre-loaded in a needle or stranded form.
 
The role of the pre-loading service is to package, assay and certify the contents of the final product configuration shipped to the customer. A commonly used method of providing this service is through independent radiopharmacies. Manufacturers send loose seeds along with the physician’s instructions to the radiopharmacy which, in turn, loads needles and/or strands the seeds according to the doctor’s instructions. These radiopharmacies then sterilize the product and certify the final packaging prior to shipping directly to the end user.
 
In fiscal year 2012, IsoRay obtained a CE mark which allows shipment of seeds loaded into flexible braided strands and flexible strands attached to bioabsorbable mesh into the European Union.
 
Manufacturing Facility
 
The Company maintains a production facility located at Applied Process Engineering Laboratory (APEL) in Richland, Washington. The APEL facility became operational in September 2007. The production facility has over 15,000 square feet and includes space for isotope separation, seed production, order dispensing, a clean room for radiopharmacy work, and a dedicated shipping area. In 2015, the Company entered into a modification to the production facility lease that modified the requirement to return the facility to ground at the time of exit at Company discretion, exercised an extension in 2017 to increase the lease term to April 30, 2021, and reduced the required notice to terminate the lease early from twelve months to six months. This lease modification provides the flexibility required for the Company to plan, design and construct its own production facility, which is expected to reduce operational cash flow requirements and provide for long-term security of production capabilities for the Company. The construction of a new facility is subject to obtaining acceptable financing. No assurances can be given at this time regarding the ability of the Company to obtain such financing. The Company has completed the design process for a new facility and has permit ready plans to build when the Company needs to move into a new facility. Management believes that construction of the facility will take 18 to 24 months to complete from the time that ground is broken.
GliaSite® Radiation Therapy System
 
IsoRay discontinued the GliaSite® RTS in March 2016.

Sales and Marketing
 
Marketing Strategy
 
In 2017, the Company implemented and began to execute a new sales and marketing strategy.  This strategy involves a more direct focus on the prostate cancer market and existing Cesium-131 customers, with a secondary focus on developing opportunities in emerging applications, including brain tumors, gynecological cancers and head and neck tumors.  This focus was supported by a complete redesign of the Company brand, website and collateral materials.  This effort was initiated in fall 2016. 
 
This follows the changes to the sales and marketing team that occurred in 2016, when the Company hired a Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Michael Krachon, who brings more than twenty years of experience of progressive growth in sales and marketing with the past fifteen years in the brachytherapy market. Management also engaged the consulting services of industry veteran Lori Woods, who contributes more than twenty years of experience in the oncology medical device and services industry. Ms. Woods previously served IsoRay from 2006 to 2010 as a Vice-President and eventually as Chief Operating Officer. 
 
Further to support the new marketing strategy, the Company has started the process of reestablishing its medical advisory boards to provide professional input and insight regarding the Company’s current products and research and developments efforts. The boards will vary by cancer type/site and the supporting specialties that treat that cancer. They will include, but not be limited to, radiation oncologists, surgeons, urologists, and physicists. The boards will be a mix of customers and non-customers, which the Company believes will provide increased insight regarding the perception of its products and opportunities to meet the needs of the market. The Company held its first advisory meeting for prostate cancer in September 2016, with the next meeting scheduled at the American Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncologists (ASTRO) professional meeting in San Diego; in September 2017, and is looking to continue to build additional advisory boards as the other applications grow in viability. 
 
The market for treatments for localized prostate cancer is very competitive and largely hinges upon two factors: the demonstration of long term follow-up data that has been presented to the prostate cancer treatment profession and the economic and strategic dynamics of the different therapeutic options. Cs-131 was introduced to the prostate cancer marketplace more than a decade after Iodine-125 and Palladium-103, and the resulting time for mature clinical data to be developed has proven an obstacle to widespread market acceptance. The time to publish these results is lengthy and includes time to enroll patients in protocols which may take multiple years depending on the size of the enrollment population, time to aggregate the results at five years from the final patient treatment, time to analyze the data and author the article followed by the time for peer review, and publication in a medical journal. The total time for this process may approach a decade from start to publication. Management believes that the impressive results achieved for treatment with Cs-131 at the five-year mark should create further scientific support for Cs-131 as an attractive treatment for localized prostate cancer, overcoming at least some of the initial resistance predicated on the lack of long-term follow-up reports. The data that was published in fiscal year 2015 is discussed in the section titled Industry Information, Prostate Cancer Treatment, “Comparing Cesium-131 to I-125 and Pd-103 Clinical Results.” In addition to the challenges presented by the limited published results for Cs-131, the prostate brachytherapy market has been pressured by the economic differences and strategic dynamics of competing treatment options such as robotic surgical devices and external beam radiation facilities. These factors have combined to result in the current multi-year contraction of the prostate brachytherapy market. The declining market has impacted the competitive landscape, reducing the number of competitors and their respective investments in sales, marketing and product development efforts. Based upon Company market review and research, there appears to be an opportunity for IsoRay to expand its current market opportunity with an investment in sales and marketing efforts. The Company believes its recent hires of both sales and marketing veterans with regional sales support will lead to growth of their market share in the prostate cancer treatment business. The Company also believes that an increased share of the prostate brachytherapy market share will assist in facilitating Cs-131 brachytherapy cancer treatment growth in other body sites.
 
The professional and patient market segments each play a role in the ultimate choice of cancer treatment and the specific isotope chosen for seed brachytherapy treatment. The Company has developed a customized brand message for each audience. The Company’s new website was launched in the fall of 2016, and delivers the message that Cs-131 is a treatment option for cancers throughout the body. IsoRay is developing and/or refreshing print, visual and digital media (including physician brochures discussing the clinical advantages of Cs-131, clinical information materials, and digital content for the website and social media awareness efforts). In addition, the Company attends national professional meetings, including:

§ | various local chapter meetings. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company also continues to consult with noted contributors from the medical physics community and expects that articles for professional journals regarding the benefits of and clinical trials involving Cs-131 will continue to be submitted.
 
In addition, the Company continues to promote the clinical findings of the various protocols and publications through presentations by respected thought leaders. The Company will continually review and update all marketing materials as more clinical information is gathered from the protocols and studies.
 
Apart from clinical studies and papers sponsored by the Company, several physicians across the country have independently published papers and studies on the benefits of Cs-131.
 
In today’s U.S. health care market, patients are more informed and involved in the management of their health than in the past. Many physicians relate incidents of their patients coming for consultations armed with articles researched on the Internet and other sources describing new treatments and medications. In many cases, these patients are demanding a certain therapy or drug and the physicians are complying when medically appropriate.
 
Because of this consumer-driven market factor, we also promote our products directly to the general public. We target the prostate cancer patient, his spouse, family, care givers and loved ones. We emphasize to these segments the specific advantages of the Cs-131 brachytherapy seed through our newly developed website (located at www.isoray.com), patient advocacy efforts, informational patient materials and patient testimonials, other awareness efforts through social media channels, and advertisements in specific markets supporting brachytherapy. None of our websites should be considered a part of this Report.
 
The Company’s marketing plan with regard to non-prostate segments includes identifying and exhibiting at scientific meetings attended by specialty physicians who perform procedures related to Company’s product offerings, direct sales contact with such physicians (for example thoracic surgeons and neuro-surgeons), the development and dissemination of training videos and other media that outline the Company’s products, and the implementation of local training events to provide product and procedure information to potential customers. 
 
Further, the Company is partnering with key clinicians within each application to support early experiences and identify additional facilities that may be interested in the applications.  The Company continues to work with its existing radiation oncology physician customers and to educate them as to additional or new Company products and expand utility of Cs-131 within the facility and across different disease sites. To facilitate this expanded position, the Company’s sales managers call on existing radiation oncology physicians and other key decision makers within an organization to discuss the available clinical results and experiences in coordination with key Company scientific personnel to educate the customer representatives about different Cs-131 applications and comparisons to competing treatments.
 
Sales and Distribution
 
In the prostate cancer market, the sales organization targets radiation oncologists and medical physicists as well as urologists and facility administrators as key clinical decision-makers in the type of radiation therapy offered to prostate cancer patients.
 
With respect to non-prostate applications, the Company targets neurosurgeons, thoracic surgeons, gynecologic oncologists and other surgeons in addition to radiation oncologists. After these clinicians identify the value of the Company’s Cs-131 products, the Company then also needs support for the procedure from the medical physicists on staff and facility administrators. The sales cycle for non-prostate applications has proved to be a longer process than for prostate applications and often takes nine months or longer before the Company is licensed in a new hospital and can make its first sale.

IsoRay has a direct sales organization consisting of territory sales managers, and a Vice-President of Sales and Marketing responsible for the development of the team and the execution of the sales plan. The Company’s territory sales managers are responsible for all sales activities in their respective territories and solicit potential specialist physicians in all areas of the body. This approach allows our territory sales managers to call on a single location for all applications of our products, resulting in a more efficient sales approach.
 
With the hiring of the Vice-President of Sales and Marketing, the addition of two new senior territory managers, and the addition of the Director of Marketing and product manager, the commercial team is fully committed to and is in the process of executing the commercial plan for the development of new sales materials, training materials, and website assistance.


The Company expects to continue to explore the opportunity to extend its customer base outside the U.S. market through use of established distributors in target markets of other countries. As of September 1, 2017, the Company had independent distributors in Italy, Switzerland and Russia. The Company’s initial focus on the international markets was for the sale of the GliaSite® RTS, which was discontinued in March 2016. This has shifted to targeted prostate and gynecological centers in the targeted markets. Although it still has two international distribution agreements in place, the Company continues to experience difficulties in generating sales of Cs-131 products through its international distributors.
 
Reimbursement
 
Reimbursement by third party payers is the primary means of payment for all IsoRay products. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is the primary payer, providing coverage for approximately 65% of all prostate brachytherapy cases and a majority of non-prostate procedures. Well established brachytherapy coverage and payment policies are currently in place by CMS and other non-governmental payers for out-patient procedures. For surgical procedures provided in an in-patient setting, payment is provided as part of a DRG code, which includes the surgical elements of the procedure.


In the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (HOPPS) out-patient setting, brachytherapy sources are legislated to be paid individually. Under this umbrella, in 2003, CMS established a unique HCPCS code for Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds that permitted providers to report the use of Cs-131 directly to payers.  In July 2007, CMS established two separate Cs-131 codes for providers to report loose seeds and stranded seeds due to the cost differential of these two products.  Reimbursement for prostate brachytherapy services and sources is well established in the U.S. and most providers (hospitals and physicians) are not faced with reimbursement challenges when providing this treatment option to patients. 
 
In June 2016, the Company rejoined the Coalition for the Advancement of Brachytherapy (CAB). CAB is a national non-profit association composed of manufacturers and developers of sources, needles and other brachytherapy devices and ancillary products used in the fields of medicine and life sciences. CAB has dedicated significant resources to the clinical use of brachytherapy including the treatment of prostate and other types of cancer as well as vascular disease. In addition, on an annual basis, CAB performs a review of the existing reimbursement structure for its members, allowing CAB members to have input into the future reimbursement structure for their products. In July, 2017, CAB disbanded, due to shrinking funding as a result of the consolidation of the brachytherapy market. The Company is pursuing consulting relationships with key support members of the former CAB organization to ensure that the key actions are performed, with a dedicated focus to the impact of reimbursement policies on Cesium-131.
 
As noted above, there are two different methodologies for CMS payment. The first, the out-patient setting, includes prostate brachytherapy, and a limited range of other procedures, including some gynecological implants, and as such, is covered by the CMS Outpatient Prospective Payment System, which since 2010 has provided a fixed reimbursement per seed for stranded and loose seeds.  Iodine, Palladium and Cesium each have their own reimbursement values for stranded and loose seeds.  If reported correctly when seeds are submitted for payment to CMS, providers are reimbursed at a flat rate that is determined by median costs of the seeds. It is expected that this reimbursement system established in January 2010 will continue as currently scheduled through calendar 2018 but there is no assurance that this will occur. CMS has generally continued its historical trend of declining year over year reimbursement with few exceptions. Private insurance companies have historically followed the CMS reimbursement policies. The Company expects that CMS will continue its annual review of payments provided as reimbursement for our various products and that CMS will continue to provide favorable reimbursement rates for our Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds, but  there is no assurance this will continue.

The other payment method is for in-patient procedures, where the patient remains in the hospital for more than 24 hours. Lung, brain and head and neck implant procedures utilizing brachytherapy sources require the patient to be admitted to the hospital. In-patient procedures are covered by CMS which remits a set amount depending on the kind of surgery being performed and the status of the patient. Under this Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) system, the hospital pays for all the items involved in the care of the patient excluding physician fees. The brachytherapy seeds in these in-patient cases are not paid for separately by CMS, but rather included as part of the DRG payments from CMS. Because the Company’s seeds may not be reimbursed by CMS, there can be difficulty in convincing hospitals to use the Company’s products. The Company contracted with a reimbursement consultant in April of 2016 to review opportunities to establish incremental reimbursement from CMS for in-patient care for brachytherapy. The Company submitted for and was granted an ICD-10 code for the use of Cesium-131 with surgical brain procedures.  The Company plans on considering additional applications for DRG codes for intraoperative brachytherapy treatments in the future. Receipt of additional DRG codes in the future for brachytherapy applications will assist in the sales to hospitals and institutions that currently are not reimbursed for brachytherapy radiation for intraoperative care. Management believes the lack of incremental reimbursement for brachytherapy by CMS and private insurers placed at the time of surgery rather than delivered at a point in time following surgery may be impeding the faster and broader adoption of intraoperative brachytherapy and unfortunately short of new legislation changing this system will remain an ongoing deterrent for use of these products. 

In October 2016, the Company submitted a New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) application. This filing formally requests additional reimbursement for the Cesium-131 based GammaTile™ treatment for brain cancer. Because the Company’s 510(k) filing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is still pending, this application is currently not under consideration. The Company plans to re-file the NTAP application in October 2017.


Other Information
 
Customers
 
The following are the Company’s top three customers, facilities or physician practices that utilize multiple surgical facilities at which primarily prostate brachytherapy procedures are performed, accounted for approximately 37.6% of the total Company product sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017:

Facility | Location | % of revenue | 
------------------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+-----
El Camino, Los Gatos, and other facilities1 | Northern CA | | 22.9 | %
University of Pittsburg Medical Center – Mercy | PA | | 7.9 | %
Bon Secours DePaul | VA | | 6.8 | %
Total | | | 37.6 | %


1. | The head of the single largest physician practice also serves as the Company’s medical director. As the medical director, this physician advises the Company Board of Directors and management, provides technical advice related to product development and research and development, and provides internal training to the Company sales staff and professional training to our sales staff and to other physicians. Revenue from this practice decreased by $119k in the year ended June 30, 2017 when compared to the year ended June 30, 2016. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The loss of either the single largest physician practice or a combination of the other significant facilities and customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, which would continue until the Company located new customers to replace them. There can be no assurance this would occur in a timely manner or at all.
 
Proprietary Rights
 
The Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, software security measures, license agreements and nondisclosure agreements to protect its proprietary rights. Some of the Company’s proprietary information may not be patentable.

Our management believes that certain aspects of the IsoRay seed design and construction techniques are patentable innovations. These innovations resulted in a patent granted by the USPTO under Patent Number 7,410,458, in August 2008, with an expiration date of December 5, 2025. Certain methodologies regarding isotope production, separation, and seed manufacture are retained as trade secrets and are embodied in IsoRay’s procedures and documentation. Four patents have been granted by the USPTO relating to methods of deriving Cs-131 developed by IsoRay employees: Patent Number 7,479,261, with an expiration date of April 6, 2027; Patent Number 7,531,150, with an expiration date of July 13, 2027; Patent Number 7,316,644, with an expiration date of August 5, 2025; and Patent Number 7,510,691, with an expiration date of July 19, 2027. The Company has two patents that were issued on April 23, 2014 and are effective in Canada (Canada 2576907 and 2571349). The Company has patents granted in the Russian Federation which expire at various times in 2024 and 2025. The Company has a single patent granted in each of the Netherlands and India that both expire on June 22, 2025. The Company has a single patent pending in the EU and Hong Kong. The Company is continuing its efforts to develop and patent additional methods of deriving Cs-131 and other isotopes.
 
There are specific conditions attached to the assignment of the Cs-131 Trust patent from the late Lane Bray. In particular, the associated Royalty Agreement provides for 1% of gross profit payment from seed sales to Lane Bray and 1% of gross profit from any use of the Cs-131 process patent for non-seed products. If IsoRay reassigns the Royalty Agreement to another company, these royalties increase to 2%. The Royalty Agreement has an anti-shelving clause that requires IsoRay to return the patent if IsoRay permanently abandons sales of products using the invention. During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded royalty expense of $21,000 and $18,000, respectively, related to this patent.


The terms of a license agreement with the Lawrence Family Trust (successor to Don Lawrence) for a patent application and related “know-how” require the payment of a royalty based on the Net Factory Sales Price, as defined in the agreement, of licensed product sales. Because the licensor’s patent application was ultimately abandoned, only a 1% “know-how” royalty remains applicable. To date, management believes that there have been no product sales incorporating the “know-how,” and therefore believes no royalty is due. Management believes that ultimately no royalties will be paid under this agreement as there is no intent to use this “know-how” in the future.
 
The Lawrence Family Trust has disputed management’s contention that it is not using this “know-how.” On September 25, 2007, and again on October 31, 2007, the Company participated in nonbinding mediation regarding this matter; however, no settlement was reached with the Lawrence Family Trust. After additional settlement discussions, which ended in April 2008, the parties failed to reach a settlement. The parties may demand binding arbitration at any time.
 
Research and Development
 
During the three-year period ended June 30, 2017, IsoRay and its subsidiaries incurred approximately $2.11 million in costs related to research and development activities. The Company expects to continue ongoing research and development activities for the foreseeable future. Chief among R&D expenditures in fiscal year 2017 are new product development (GammaTile™ and others) and the support of clinical research studies that are accumulating data on the subjects of prostate and head and neck cancers. Other clinical research, including the study of Cs-131 in the treatment of brain, gynecological and other cancers, are currently funded by sources other than the Company.
Government Regulation
 
The Company’s present and future intended activities in the development, manufacture and sale of cancer therapy products are subject to extensive laws, regulations, regulatory approvals and guidelines. Within the United States, the Company’s therapeutic radiological devices must comply with the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which is enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Company is also required to adhere to applicable FDA Quality System Regulations, also known as the Good Manufacturing Practices, which include extensive record keeping and periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities. The Company’s predecessor obtained FDA 510(k) clearance in March 2003 to market its Cs-131 seed for the treatment of localized solid tumors and other malignant disease and IsoRay obtained FDA 510(k) clearance in November 2006 to market preloaded brachytherapy seeds and in August 2009 for preloading flexible braided strands and bioabsorbable mesh.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates, among other things, new product clearances and approvals to establish the safety and efficacy of these products. We are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Environmental Protection Act.
 
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, distribution, use, reporting, advertising and promotion of such products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in civil penalties, recall, injunction or seizure of products, refusal of the government to approve or clear product approval applications, disqualification from sponsoring or conducting clinical investigations, preventing us from entering into government supply contracts, withdrawal of previously approved applications, and criminal prosecution.

In the United States, medical devices are classified into three different categories over which the FDA applies increasing levels of regulation: Class I, Class II, and Class III. Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification 510(k); most Class II devices require premarket notification 510(k); and most Class III devices require premarket approval. Our Cs-131 seed is a Class II device and received 510(k) clearance in March 2003.
 
Approval of new Class III medical devices is a lengthy procedure and can take a number of years and require the expenditure of significant resources. There is a shorter FDA review and clearance process for Class II medical devices, the premarket notification or 510(k) process, whereby a company can market certain Class II medical devices that can be shown to be substantially equivalent to other legally marketed devices. Since brachytherapy seeds have been classified by the FDA as a Class II device, we have been able to achieve market clearance for our Cs-131 seed using the 510(k) process.
 
In August 2011, IsoRay Medical received clearance from the FDA for its premarket notification 510(k) for the GliaSite® RTS. The GliaSite® RTS is the only FDA-cleared balloon catheter device used in the treatment of brain cancer. In May 2014, the Company received clearance from the FDA for its pre-market notification 510(k) for the radiotherapy solution Cesitrex® (liquid Cs-131) for use with the GliaSite® RTS. The Company has since discontinued sales of the GliaSite® RTS.
 
As a registered medical device manufacturer with the FDA, we are subject to inspection to ensure compliance with FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. These regulations require that we and any of our contract manufacturers design, manufacture and service products, and maintain documents in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, distribution, storage, design control, and service activities. Modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of a device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device require a new 510(k) premarket notification for any significant product modification.
 
The Medical Device Reporting regulation requires that we provide information to the FDA on deaths or serious injuries alleged to be associated with the use of our devices, as well as product malfunctions that are likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Labeling and promotional activities are regulated by the FDA and, in some circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission.
 
As a medical device manufacturer, we are also subject to laws and regulations administered by governmental entities at the federal, state and local levels. For example, our facility is licensed as a medical device manufacturing facility in the State of Washington and is subject to periodic state regulatory inspections. Our customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us.
 
In support of IsoRay’s global strategy to expand marketing to Canada, the European Union (EU) and Russia, we initiated the process in fiscal year 2008 to obtain the European CE Mark, Canadian registration, and certification to ISO 13485:2003, an internationally recognized quality system. During the fiscal year 2014, the CE Mark was renewed for an additional five years. European law requires that medical devices sold in any EU Member State comply with the requirements of the European Medical Device Directive (MDD) or the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMDD). IsoRay’s brachytherapy seeds are classified in Europe as an active implantable and are subject to the AIMDD. Compliance with the AIMDD and obtaining a CE Mark involves being certified to ISO 13485:2003 and obtaining approval of the product technical file by a notified body that is recognized by competent authorities of a Member State. Compliance with ISO 13485:2003 is also required for registration of a company for sale of its products in Canada. Many of the recognized EU Notified Bodies are also recognized by Health Canada to conduct the ISO 13485:2003 inspections for Canadian registration. During fiscal year 2009, the Company received its certification to ISO 13485:2003 and obtained approval from Health Canada for its Canadian registration. The Company has had no success in selling the product in the Canadian market and through its distributors is currently focusing on the markets in Switzerland, Italy, and the Russian Federation. On June 18, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with MedikorPharma-Ural LLC as the distributor in the Russian Federation. The agreement provides the distributor with the ability to sell the entire product line. As of June 30, 2017, this agreement is no longer in effect. On July 14, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with a new distributor in Russia that provides for the ability to sell the entire product line in the Russian Federation. The agreement has a one-year initial term with two additional one-year terms which automatically renew unless either party invoke their right to terminate earlier under the provisions of the agreement. On August 1, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with a distributor in Italy for the territory of Italy and Switzerland, as its prior Italian distribution agreement, with an affiliate of the new distributor, had expired without any sales.

In the United States, as a manufacturer of medical devices and devices utilizing radioactive byproduct material, we are subject to extensive regulation by not only federal governmental authorities, such as the FDA and FAA, but also by state and local governmental authorities, such as the Washington State Department of Health, to ensure such devices are safe and effective. In Washington State, the Department of Health, by agreement with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), regulates the possession, use, and disposal of radioactive byproduct material as well as the manufacture of radioactive sealed sources to ensure compliance with state and federal laws and regulations. Our Cs-131 brachytherapy seeds constitute both medical devices and radioactive sealed sources and are subject to these regulations.
 
Moreover, our use, management, and disposal of certain radioactive substances and wastes are subject to regulation by several federal and state agencies depending on the nature of the substance or waste material. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal and state regulations for this purpose.
 
Seasonality
 
The Company believes that some seed implantation procedures are deferred around physician vacations (particularly in the summer months), holidays, and medical conventions and conferences resulting in a seasonal influence on the Company’s business. These factors cause a momentary decline in revenue which management believes is ultimately realized in prior or following periods. Because a material portion of the Company’s business is dependent on three  customers, physician practices or facilities, simultaneous or extended vacations by the physicians at these facilities or by our single largest physician whose total revenue alone represents a material portion of the Company’s business could cause significant drops in the Company’s productivity during those reporting periods.
Employees
 
As of September 1, 2017, IsoRay employed 36 full-time individuals. The Company’s future success will depend, in part, on its ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified sales, technical and management personnel. From time to time, the Company may employ independent consultants or contractors to support its research and development, marketing, sales, accounting and administrative organizations. None of the Company’s employees are represented by any collective bargaining unit. On September 1, 2017, the Company employed six direct sales people.
Competition
 
The Company competes in a market characterized by technological innovation, extensive research efforts, and significant competition. In general, the IsoRay Cs-131 brachytherapy seed competes with conventional methods of treating localized cancer, including, but not limited to, all forms of prostatectomy surgery and external beam radiation therapy which includes intensity modulated radiation therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery and proton therapy, as well as competing permanent and temporary brachytherapy devices.
 
Management believes the Company’s patented Cs-131 separation process is likely to provide a sustainable competitive advantage. Production of Cs-131 also requires specialized facilities that represent high cost and long lead time if not readily available.

The Company’s brachytherapy products used in non-prostate applications typically compete with temporary (high dose-rate, HDR), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), which can be provided as conventional or intensity modulated radiation therapy, or as stereotactic radiosurgery, a technique that delivers high doses of radiation to a target in a much lower number of sessions than other forms of EBRT.
