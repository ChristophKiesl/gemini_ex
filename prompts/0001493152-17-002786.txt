Item 1. Business.
Our History
 
MamaMancini’s Holdings, Inc. (formerly Mascot Properties, Inc.) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 22, 2009. Mascot Properties, Inc.’s (“Mascot”) activities since its inception consisted of trying to locate real estate properties to manage, primarily related to student housing, and services which included general property management, maintenance and activities coordination for residents. Mascot did not have any significant development of such business and did not derive any revenue. Due to the lack of results in its attempt to implement its original business plan, management determined it was in the best interests of the shareholders to look for other potential business opportunities.
 
On February 22, 2010, MamaMancini’s LLC was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the state of New Jersey in order to commercialize our initial products. On March 5, 2012, the members of MamaMancini’s, LLC, holders of 4,700 units (the “Units”) of MamaMancini’s LLC, exchanged the Units for 15,000,000 shares of common stock and those certain options to purchase an additional 223,404 shares of MamaMancini’s Inc. (the “Exchange”). Upon consummation of the Exchange, MamaMancini’s LLC ceased to exist and all further business has been and continues to be conducted by MamaMancini’s Inc.
 
On January 24, 2013, Mascot, Mascot Properties Acquisition Corp, a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), MamaMancini’s Inc., a privately-held Delaware Corporation headquartered in New Jersey (“Mama’s”) and David Dreslin, an individual (the “Majority Shareholder”), entered into an Acquisition Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) pursuant to which the Merger Sub was merged with and into Mama’s, with Mama’s surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”). The transaction (the “Closing”) took place on January 24, 2013 (the “Closing Date”). Mascot acquired, through a reverse triangular merger, all of the outstanding capital stock of Mama’s in exchange for issuing Mama’s shareholders (the “Mama’s Shareholders”), pro-rata, a total of 20,054,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. As a result of the Merger, the Mama’s Shareholders became the majority shareholders of Mascot.
 
Immediately following the Closing of the Agreement, Mascot changed its business plan to that of Mama’s. On March 8, 2013, Mascot received notice from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) that its application to change its name and symbol had been approved and effective Monday, March 11, 2013, Mascot began trading under its new name, “MamaMancini’s Holdings, Inc.” (“MamaMancini’s” or the “Company”) and under its new symbol, “MMMB”.

Our Company
 
MamaMancini’s roots go back to our founder Dan Dougherty, whose grandmother Anna “Mama” Mancini emigrated from Bari, Italy to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn in 1921. Our products were developed using her old world Italian recipes that were handed down to her grandson, Dan Dougherty. Today we market a line of all natural specialty prepared, frozen and refrigerated foods for sale in retailers around the country. Our primary products include beef, turkey, chicken and pork meatballs, all with slow cooked Italian Sauce.
 
Our products are all natural, contain a minimum number of ingredients and are generally derived from the original recipes of Anna “Mama” Mancini. Our products appeal to health-conscious consumers who seek to avoid artificial flavors, synthetic colors and preservatives that are used in many conventional packaged foods.
 
The United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) defines all natural as a product that contains no artificial ingredients, coloring ingredients or chemical preservatives and is minimally processed. The Company’s products were submitted to the USDA and approved as all natural. The Food and Safety and Inspection Service (“FSIS”) Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book (2003) requires meat and poultry labels to include a brief statement directly beneath or beside the “natural” Label claim that “explains what is meant by the term natural i.e., that the product is a natural food because it contains no artificial ingredients and is only minimally processed”. The term “natural” may be used on a meat label or poultry label if the product does not contain any artificial flavor or flavoring, coloring ingredient, chemical preservative, or any other artificial or synthetic ingredient. Additionally, the term “all natural” can be used if the FSIS approves your product and label claims. The Company’s product and label claims have been approved by the FSIS to contain the all-natural label.
 
Our products are principally sold to supermarkets and mass-market retailers. Our products are principally sold in multiple sections of the supermarket, including: hot bars, salad bars, prepared foods (meals), sandwich, as well as cold deli and foods-to-go sections. Our products are also sold in the frozen food and fresh meat sections. Consumers can find our products at leading food retailers (supermarkets), including:

During the year ended January 31, 2017, the Company earned revenues from two customers representing approximately 28% and 13% of gross sales. During the year ended January 31, 2016, the Company earned revenues from four customers representing approximately 16%, 14%, 13% and 10% of gross sales. As of January 31, 2017, these two customers represented approximately 44% and 12% of total gross outstanding receivables, respectively. As of January 31, 2016, these four customers represented approximately 18%, 7%, 9% and 30% of total gross outstanding receivables, respectively. We depend heavily on these customers. We have grown the number of food retailers (supermarkets) carrying our products to approximately 11,700 supermarkets in January 2017. In the supermarkets that carry our products, we sell an average of 3.3 of our stock keeping units (“SKUs”). The number of supermarkets carrying our products multiplied by the number of our SKUs carried at those supermarkets equals shelf placements for our products. We have grown the number of shelf placements to approximately 38,700 in January 2017.

The Company continually reviews it accounts in order focus on maximum performance, and as a result periodically eliminates under-performing accounts.
 
For the years ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, one vendor (a related party) represented approximately 100% and 95% of the Company’s purchases, respectively.
 
Industry Overview
 
Our products are considered specialty prepared foods, in that they are all natural, taste great, are authentic Italian and are made with high quality ingredients. The market for specialty and prepared foods spans several sections of the supermarket, including frozen, deli- prepared foods, and the specialty meat segment of the meat department. The overall size of the specialty prepared food business was calculated by the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade in association with Mintel Research at over $109 billion in 2015 and has grown 22% since 2012.
 
Packaged Facts, a leading publisher of market research on the food, beverage, consumer packaged goods, and demographic sectors, projects the overall sales of Refrigerated Meats and Meals to be approximately $31 billion by 2018, up from $23 billion in 2013. According to Packaged Facts, this 5.5% implied CAGR is likely driven by trends including a focus on convenience and healthy and creative new products. In addition, Packaged Facts projects that retail sales of Natural/Organic Foods and Beverages will reach $53.5 billion in 2014 and will grow to $86.7 billion by 2019. This implied CAGR of 10.1% is likely driven by the growing social and environmental issues surrounding the interest in and health benefits of natural and organic foods. Technomic, a consulting firm in the fresh prepared foods industry, projects fresh food sales to be $33.4 billion in 2017, up from $26 billion in 2012.
 
Our Strengths
 
We believe that the following strengths differentiate our products and our brand:
 

● | Authentic recipes and great taste. Our products are founded upon Anna “Mama” Mancini’s old world Italian recipes. We believe the authenticity of our products has enabled us to build and maintain loyalty and trust among our current customers and will help us attract new customers. Additionally, we continuously receive positive customer testimonials regarding the great taste and quality of our products. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Healthy and convenient. Our products are made only from high quality natural ingredients, including domestic inspected beef, whole Italian tomatoes, genuine imported Pecorino Romano, real eggs, natural breadcrumbs, olive oil and other herbs and spices. Our products are also simple to prepare. Virtually every product we offer is ready-to-serve within 12 minutes, thereby providing quick and easy meal solutions for our customers. By including the sauce and utilizing a tray with our packaging, our meatballs can be prepared quickly and easily. 
● | Great value. We strive to provide our customers with a great tasting product using all natural ingredients at an affordable price. Typical retail prices for 16 oz. packages ranges from $5.99 to $7.49, and $5.99 to $8.99 for bulk products sold in delis or hot bars. We believe the sizes of our product offerings represent a great value for the price. 
● | New products and innovation. Since our inception, we have continued to introduce new and innovative products. While we pride on ourselves on our traditional beef, turkey, chicken and pork meatballs, we have continuously made efforts to grow and diversify our line of products while maintaining our high standards for all natural, healthy ingredients and great taste. New items introduced in the last year include: 


Five Cheese Stuffed Beef Meatballs | Antibiotic Free Beef and Turkey Meatballs

Sales/Brokers
 

● | Strong consumer loyalty. Many of our consumers are loyal and enthusiastic brand advocates. Our consumers trust us to deliver great-tasting products made with all natural ingredients. Consumers have actively communicated with us through our website and/or social media channels. We believe that this consumer interaction has generated interest in our products and has inspired enthusiasm for our brand. We also believe that enthusiasm for our products has led and will continue to lead to repeat purchases and new consumers trying our products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Experienced leadership. We have a proven and experienced senior management team. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Carl Wolf, has been with us since inception and has over 35 years of experience in the management and operations of food companies. Mr. Wolf was the founder, majority shareholder, Chairman of the Board, and CEO of Alpine Lace Brands, Inc., a public company engaged in the development, marketing and distribution of cheese, deli meats and other specialty food products, which was sold to Land O’Lakes, Inc. In addition, the other members of our board of directors also have significant experience in the food industry. 

Our Growth Strategy
 
We are actively executing a strategy to build our brand’s reputation, grow sales and improve our product and operating margins by pursuing the following growth initiatives:

● | Increase product placements in the perimeter within retail locations. We strive for product placements in the perishable departments of retail locations. We believe adding shelf placements within the supermarkets that carry our products will increase customer awareness, leading to more consumers purchasing our products and expanding our market share. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Increase Sales in “Fresh” Section. Increase sales in the “Fresh” section (in the perimeter of the retainer), where there is significant sales growth and higher margins, over products in the “Frozen” section which are showing zero to negative growth. 
● | Increase retail locations. We intend to increase sales by expanding the number of retail stores that sell our products in the mainstream grocery and mass merchandiser channels. 
● | Increase Overall Sales. We have an experienced sales staff and now employ one full time Vice President of sales as well as our Co-Founder Dan Dougherty, Carl Wolf, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Matthew Brown, our President, each of whom is involved with selling to, and managing sales with, major supermarket chains. 
● | Expand food brokerage network. We currently work with retail food brokers nationwide and intend to add additional food brokers to increase our geographical coverage in the United States to approximately 90%. 
● | Enhance awareness through marketing. We have increased our social media activity with Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube. We also engage with consumers through newsletter mailings, blogs, and special projects, including a bank of recipe videos and contests and giveaways. Targeted consumer merchandising activity, including virtual couponing, on-pack couponing, mail-in rebates, product demonstrations, and co-op retail advertising will continue into the future in order to increase sales and generate new customers. 
● | Adding new products. Our market research and consumer testing enable us to identify attractive new product opportunities. We intend to continue to introduce new products in both existing and new product lines that appeal to a wide range of consumers. We currently have approximately 26 product offerings.

Pricing
 
Our pricing strategy focuses on being competitively priced with other premium brands. Since our products are positioned in the authentic premium prepared food category, we maintain prices competitive with those of similar products and prices slightly higher than those in the commodity prepared foods section. This pricing strategy also provides greater long-term flexibility as we grow our product line through the growth curve of our products. Current typical retail prices for 16 oz. packages range from $5.99 to $7.99, and $5.99 to $8.99 per pound for prepared food products sold to delis or hot bars. Increases in raw materials costs, among other factors, may lead to us consider price increases in the future.
 
Suppliers/Manufacturers
 
None of our raw materials or ingredients are grown or purchased directly by us. We employ one company, JEFE to order all raw materials or ingredients, as well as manufacture all of our products to date. JEFE is owned by both the CEO and President of the Company.
 
We are negotiating with several other manufacturers to supplement the services provided by JEFE. We currently purchase modest quantities from other manufacturers. All of the raw materials and ingredients in our products are readily available and are readily ascertainable by our suppliers. We have not experienced any material shortages of ingredients or other products necessary to our operations and do not anticipate such shortages in the foreseeable future.
 
Sales/Brokers
 
As of January 31, 2017, our products are carried by approximately 11,700 food retail locations with an average of 3.3 different items per retail location, thereby totaling approximately 38,700 product placements on shelves in such retail locations. Our products are sold in the frozen meat case, the frozen Italian specialty section, the fresh meat case, the deli (in bulk and grab n’ go pre-packaged formats) as well as hot bars and sandwich shops in food retailers.
 
Our products are sold primarily through a commission broker network. We sell to large retail chains who direct our products to their own warehouses or to large food distributors.
 
In December 2015, the Company increased its sales management efforts with the result that the Company is now actively soliciting business with almost every major retail supermarket chain in the country. Currently, all of our full-time employees and Dan Dougherty sell our products directly to supermarkets and mass retailers. MamaMancini’s products are currently sold primarily in the Northeast and Southeast.
 
Marketing
 
The majority of our marketing activity has been generated through promotional discounts, consumer trial, consumer product tastings and demonstrations, in-store merchandising and signage, couponing, word of mouth, consumer public relations, social media, special merchandising events with retailers and consumer advertising.

The Company has also developed a brand ambassador program for consumer advocates of MamaMancini’s. Advocates receive coupons, hats, tote bags and other incentives to promote our brand. In addition, the Company has an active on-line and traditional paper couponing activity and employees outside services to deliver coupons to consumers such as Facebook, newspaper free standing inserts, and on pack coupons as well as our web site. Dan Dougherty has been the principal spokesperson for MamaMancini’s, and has made appearances or had article features including the Martha Stewart Show, Entertainment Tonight, Today Cooking School, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today and People Magazine.
 
Based on the Company’s metrics for determining brand awareness, which includes market studies and analysis of consumer recognition of the MamaMancini’s brand, the Company believes that brand awareness for MamaMancini’s has grown significantly in the past 12 months.
 
Investments - Meatball Obsession
 
During 2011 the Company acquired a 34.62% interest in Meatball Obsession, LLC (“MO”) for a total investment of $27,032. This investment is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, investments are recorded at acquisition cost plus the Company’s equity in the undistributed earnings or losses of the entity. At December 31, 2011 the investment was written down to $0 due to losses incurred by MO. The Company’s ownership interest in MO has decreased due to dilution. At January 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company’s ownership interest in MO was 12% and 12%, respectively. One of our directors, Steven Burns, serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Meatball Obsession.
Competition
 
The gourmet and specialty pre-packaged and frozen food industry has many large competitors specializing in various types of cuisine from all over the world. Our product lines are currently concentrated on Italian specialty foods. While it is our contention that our competition is much more limited than the entire frozen and pre-packaged food industry based on our products’ niche market, there can be no assurances that we do not compete with the entire frozen and pre-packaged food industry. We believe our principal competitors include Quaker Maid / Philly-Gourmet Meat Company, Hormel, Rosina Company, Inc., Casa Di Bertacchi, Inc., Farm Rich, Inc., Mama Lucia, and Buona Vita, Inc.
Intellectual Property
 
Our current intellectual property consists of trade secret recipes and cooking processes for our products and three trademarks for “MamaMancini’s”, “Mac N’ Mamas” and “The Meatball Lovers Meatball”. The recipes and use of the trademarks have been assigned in perpetuity to the Company.
 
We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We will also use technical measures to protect our proprietary rights.
 
Royalty Agreement
 
In accordance with a Development and License Agreement (the “Development and License Agreement”) entered into on January 1, 2009 with Dan Dougherty relating to the use of his grandmother’s recipes for the products to be created by MamaMancini’s, Mr. Dougherty granted us a 50 year exclusive license (subject to certain minimum payments being made), with a 25 year extension option, to use and commercialize the licensed items. Under the terms of the Development and License Agreement, Mr. Dougherty shall develop a line of beef meatballs with sauce, turkey meatballs with sauce and other similar meats and sauces for commercial manufacture, distribution and sale (each a “Licensor Product” and collectively the “Licensor Products”). Mr. Dougherty shall work with us to develop Licensor Products that are acceptable to us. Upon acceptance of a Licensor Product by us, Mr. Dougherty’s trade secret recipes, formulas methods and ingredients for the preparation and production of such Licensor Products shall be subject to the Development and License Agreement. In connection with the Development and License Agreement, we pay Mr. Dougherty a royalty fee on net sales.

Supply Agreement
 
On March 1, 2010, the Company entered into a five-year agreement with JEFE. JEFE is owned by both the CEO and President of the Company. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company granted to JEFE a revocable license to use the Company’s recipes, formulas, methods and ingredients for the preparation and production of Company’s products, for manufacturing the Company’s product and all future improvements, modifications, substitutions and replacements developed by the Company. JEFE in turn granted to the Company the exclusive right to purchase the product. Under the terms of the agreement JEFE agreed to manufacture, package, and store the Company’s products. The Company has the right to purchase products from one or more other manufacturers, distributors or suppliers. The agreement contains a perpetual automatic renewal clause for a period of one year after the expiration of the initial term. During the renewal period either party may cancel the contract with written notice nine months prior to the termination date. The agreement was automatically renewed in February 2016.
 
On August 1, 2016, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Supply Agreement with JEFE which extended the term of the Agreement to July 31, 2021 (notwithstanding, in the event of a Change of Control of the Company, the Agreement will expire on the later of July 31, 20121 or a date which is three (3) years following the Change of Control. The Amended Agreement also provides for a Minimum Volume Guaranty, whereby during the Term of this Agreement, the Company agrees to deliver Purchase Orders to JEFE of not less than $963,000 per calendar month, which will result in gross profit to JEFE (at a 12% margin) of at least $115,560 per month. The Company further agreed to pay JEFE, on a monthly basis, any shortfall in JEFE’s net profit (calculated on a 12% margin) below $115,560 per month. To the extent JEFE’s profit for any month (calculated on a 12% margin) exceeds $115,560, any such excess shall be paid to the Company as a reduction against any then outstanding account payable owing by JEFE to the Company.
 
Under the terms of the Agreement if the Company specifies any change in packaging or shipping materials which results in JEFE incurring increased expense for packaging and shipping materials or in JEFE being unable to utilize obsolete packaging or shipping materials in ordinary packaging or shipping, the Company agrees to pay as additional product cost the additional cost for packaging and shipping materials and to purchase at cost such obsolete packaging and shipping materials. If the Company requests any repackaging of the product, other than due to defects in the original packaging, the Company will reimburse JEFE for any labor costs incurred in repackaging. Per the Agreement, all product delivery shipping costs are the expense of the Company.
 
Finally, it was agreed that the Company will pay JEFE $5,000 per month during the Term of the Agreement on account of certain shared expenses. In all other material respects, the terms of the original Agreement remain unchanged.
 
USDA approval / Regulations
 
Our food products, which are manufactured in third-party facilities, are subject to various federal, state and local regulations and inspection, and to extensive regulations and inspections, regarding sanitation, quality, packaging and labeling. In order to distribute and sell our products outside the State of New Jersey, the third-party food processing facilities must meet the standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”). Our third party manufacturers processing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state, and local authorities. In January 2011, the FDA’s Food Safety Modernization Act was signed into law. The law will increase the number of inspections at food facilities in the U.S. in an effort to enhance the detection of food borne illness outbreaks and order recalls of tainted food products. The facilities in which our products are manufactured are inspected regularly and comply with all the requirements of the FDA and USDA.
 
We are subject to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, and safety of food. Under this program, the FDA regulates manufacturing practices for foods through, among other things, its current “good manufacturing practices” regulations, or GMP’s, and specifies the recipes for certain foods. Specifically, the USDA defines “all natural” as a product that contains no artificial ingredients, coloring ingredients or chemical preservatives and is minimally processed. The Company’s products were submitted to the USDA and approved as “all natural”. However, should the USDA change their definition of “all natural” at some point in the future, or should MamaMancini’s change their existing recipes to include ingredients that do not meet the USDA’s definition of “all natural”, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

The FTC and other authorities regulate how we market and advertise our products, and we are currently in compliance with all regulations related thereto, although we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal and state laws and regulations. Changes in these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.
 
Quality Assurance
 
We take precautions designed to ensure the quality and safety of our products. In addition to routine third-party inspections of our contract manufacturer, we have instituted regular audits to address topics such as allergen control, ingredient, packaging and product specifications and sanitation. Under the FDA Food Modernization Act, each of our contract manufacturers is required to have a hazard analysis critical control points plan that identifies critical pathways for contaminants and mandates control measures that must be used to prevent, eliminate or reduce relevant food-borne hazards.
 
Our current contract manufacturer, JEFE, is certified in the Safe Quality Food Program. These standards are integrated food safety and quality management protocols designed specifically for the food sector and offer a comprehensive methodology to manage food safety and quality simultaneously. Certification provides an independent and external validation that a product, process or service complies with applicable regulations and standards.
 
We work with suppliers who assure the quality and safety of their ingredients. These assurances are supported by our purchasing contracts or quality assurance specification packets, including affidavits, certificates of analysis and analytical testing, where required. The quality assurance staff of both our contract manufacturer and our own internal operations department conducts periodic on-site routine audits of critical ingredient suppliers.
