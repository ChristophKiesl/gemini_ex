Overview 
 Equity Distribution Acquisition Corp. (the company, we, our and us) was incorporated in Delaware on July 7, 2020. The company was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses (a Business Combination). 
 Although we are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination, we intend to focus on prospective target businesses in North America within the industrial sector with an enterprise valuation in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. In particular, we intend to focus on companies providing technology-enabled solutions in industrial and industrial distribution markets. The company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. 
 We were originally formed in Delaware under the name Equity Distribution Acquisition Corp. in July 2020. Our executive offices are located at Two North Riverside Plaza, Suite 600, Chicago, IL, and our telephone number is (312) 454-0100. Our corporate website address is www.equitydac.com. Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, the website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in, and is not considered part of, this Report. You should not rely on any such information in making your decision whether to invest in our securities. 
 Founders 
 Our Chairman is Sam Zell, investor, entrepreneur, and founder of the private investment firm, Equity Group Investments (EGI). Mr. Zell has a 50-year track record of founding multi-billion-dollar companies and growing many others, turning around troubled assets, leading industry consolidations, and bringing companies to the public markets. He has had overarching impact on numerous industries. 
 While his investments span industries across the globe, Mr. Zell is most widely recognized as a founding father of the $1 trillion real estate investment trust (REIT). In the 1990s, he created three of the largest REITs and rallied the nascent industry to focus on providing shareholders with transparency, predictability, and accountability. In 2007, he sold Equity Office Properties Trust, the office building REIT, which he founded in 1997, for $39 billion in the largest leveraged buyout transaction at the time. He continues to chair the other two REITs he founded, Equity Residential (NYSE: EQR), a multi-family REIT, and Equity LifeStyle Properties (NYSE: ELS), a manufactured housing REIT. Mr. Zell also chairs Equity Commonwealth (NYSE: EQC), an office REIT he assumed leadership of in 2014. 
 In addition to real estate, Mr. Zells investment activity spans industrials, manufacturing, logistics, infrastructure, energy, waste services, consumer products, communications and healthcare. To date, Mr. Zell has sponsored 12 IPOs, successfully raising capital across various industries in all types of economic environments. In the 1990s, he raised $1 billion for the Zell/Chillmark Fund, one of the first and largest funds to focus on good companies with bad balance sheets. Concurrently, Mr. Zell raised $2.1 billion for the Zell/Merrill Funds, the largest distressed real estate offering at the time. In the late 2000s, Mr. Zell also sponsored the Zell Credit Opportunities Fund, which invested more than $1 billion in oil and gas, manufacturing, consumer products, and other sectors. 
 In addition, Mr. Zell serves as Chair of Covanta Holding Corporation (NYSE: CVA), an international energy-from-waste company. He previously served as Chair of Adams Respiratory Therapeutics, the creator of Mucinex, and Jacor, which led the U.S. radio industrys consolidation in the 1990s. 
 Within the Industrials sector, Mr. Zell also served as Chair of Anixter International (formerly NYSE: AXE), a global provider of wire and cable products, for 34 years until the companys sale in 2020 for $4.5 billion. EGI acquired Anixter in 1986 through the holding company Itel Corporation. Mr. Zell was drawn to Anixter because of its unique distribution pipeline, which enabled vendors to reach small buyers. By 1991, Mr. Zell had sold off 
 
1 


  Itels other investments to focus the company solely on Anixter. He set an aggressive growth strategy, quickly establishing Anixter as a global industry leader. Between 1986 and 2019, Anixter increased its revenues from $650 million to $8.8 billion, and expanded its presence from three to 50 countries. 
 Anixters long-standing success reflects one of Mr. Zells fundamental principles  to establish and maintain the alignment of interests among the board, management, and shareholders. He is an active owner and Chair who builds strong relationships with senior management. That includes Bill Galvin, who served as Anixters President and Chief Executive Officer until the companys recent sale. Mr. Galvin has joined Mr. Zell to found our company. Their complementary working relationship, respective areas of expertise, and vast collective network positions us well. 
 Mr. Galvin, our companys Chief Executive Officer, served as Anixters President and Chief Executive Officer from July 2018 through June 2020, after having led various functions and businesses within the company during his 36-year tenure. He joined Anixter in 1984 and served as: President and Chief Operating Officer (2017  2018), Executive Vice President  Network and Security Solutions (2007  2017), and Senior Vice President  North America Enterprise Cabling Solutions Sales (2006  2007). In addition, Mr. Galvin served on Anixters Board of Directors. 
 Prior to its acquisition, Anixter was a leading global distributor of Network & Security Solutions, Electrical & Electronic Solutions and Utility Power Solutions. Anixters offerings included enterprise networks, industrial MRO (maintenance, repairs, operations) supply, video surveillance applications, and electric power distribution. The company provided customers across industrial and other end-markets with full-line solutions and intelligence, resulting in reliable, resilient systems that sustained businesses and communities. Anixters solutions helped lower the cost, risk, and complexity of customers supply chains through the companys unmatched global distribution network, and supply chain and technical expertise. 
 Operationally, Mr. Galvin developed and implemented a gross margin expansion strategy, resulting in six consecutive quarters of year-over-year gross margin improvement, while investing in technology and innovation to position Anixter favorably for future growth. Strategically, Mr. Galvin shifted Anixters portfolio toward technology and service-centric markets through entry into new applications including cellular wireless solutions and expansion of existing businesses such as commercial security. Mr. Galvin also spearheaded multiple strategic acquisitions and subsequent integrations, including the acquisition of Tri-Ed in 2014 for $420 million and the 2018 acquisitions of CSD, Inner Range and Atlas Gentech. 
 Collectively, Messrs. Zell and Galvin successfully set and delivered on a strategic vision to shift Anixter toward technology-centric growth, while driving operational improvements  a rare combination within the industrial distribution sector that drove value for Anixters shareholders. 
 In June 2020, Anixter closed on its merger with WESCO International, which included a 55% premium to Anixters share price of $63.30 immediately prior to Mr. Galvin assuming the role of President and Chief Executive Officer in July 2018. Anixters enterprise value in the transaction was approximately $4.5 billion. 
 We believe that Messrs. Zell and Galvins respective and complementary expertise position our company well to identify attractive business combination opportunities, execute strategic transactions and have a transformative impact on target businesses. 
 Market Opportunity 
 The industrial distribution market alone is in excess of $2.5 trillion in the United States, based on a publication by McKinsey & Company. Therefore, the total industrial market including manufacturers and service providers is even larger. The industrial market is broad, diverse and fragmented, with participants differentiating their individual offerings through a combination of technology, innovation, technical know-how, customer relationships and value-added services. Players within this market support and enable both the manufacturing supply chain as well as aftermarket activities including repair, replacement, service and maintenance across a range of end markets. 
 The industrial industry is highly fragmented across multiple dimensions, including end market, geographic region and supplier alignment, amongst others. As an example, the top ten industrial distribution companies in the United States 
 
2 


  collectively accounted for approximately 5% of the overall market based on 2019 revenue. Within this fragmented market, leading players must consistently differentiate themselves to capture and maintain wallet share and grow, including through acquisitions. 
 We believe the rapid pace of change, accelerated by increasing proliferation of technology, will drive a wave of consolidation within the industry. Furthermore, in order to keep pace with larger competitors, smaller players are under pressure to make material investments in technology, requiring significant financial resources and management expertise. We intend to focus on companies that have the ability to competitively differentiate themselves based on a combination of service, technology, innovation and / or market position. 
 Customers are increasingly seeking digital experiences in the way they engage with industrial companies, and competitive customer solutions require a technology-first mentality. These solutions include optimized supply chain management, real-time vendor-managed inventory, just-in-time delivery, private label products, kitting, and customization. We believe customers are willing to pay a premium for these solutions due to the operational efficiencies that the solutions provide. The combination of robust service capabilities and innovative technology advancements provide sustainable competitive advantages for leading industrial companies. We believe the favorable relative positioning of leading players within a highly fragmented market creates a unique need for industry consolidation. 
 The industrial market segment offers many attractive attributes for growth opportunities, including significant fragmentation, new disruptive technology advancements in manufacturing and enhancements to the global supply chain models. Despite these attractive attributes, we believe strong leadership and operational excellence will be required for industrial companies to capitalize on future growth opportunities amid the industrys technology-driven evolution. Our founders are uniquely qualified to advise and grow such businesses and will be able to drive immediate value through margin improvement initiatives such as pricing enhancements and operational efficiencies, expanding value-added service capabilities, increasing market access and improving cash flow characteristics. 
 Board of Directors 
 In addition to our founders, our Board of Directors is comprised of a distinguished group of individuals with significant experience and expertise in the industrial sector. 
 Mr. Robert W. Grubbs was appointed to our Board of Directors in connection with our initial public offering. Mr. Grubbs served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Anixter from 1998 to 2008, following a successful 30-year career with the company. From 1994 to 2008 Mr. Grubbs was also the President and Chief Executive Officer of Anixter Inc., a subsidiary of Anixter. During Mr. Grubbs tenure, Anixter saw tremendous growth in sales, profitability and shareholder returns. Mr. Grubbs continued to serve on the board of Anixter until May 2018. Mr. Grubbs currently serves on the board of Schneider National, a truckload, intermodal and logistics services provider, and is the Executive Chairman of Harrington Industrial Plastics, a process-solutions provider for corrosive and high-purity water systems. Previously, Mr. Grubbs served as the Chairman of GNAP, a leading specialty abrasives distributor, from 2016 until 2018 when Frontenac sold it to CenterOak Partners. Mr. Grubbs also has significant experience working with private equity firms, both through GNAP and Ohio Transmission Corporation, a leading technical distributor previously held by Irving Place Capital and currently held by Genstar Capital. Mr. Grubbs served as Chairman of Ohio Transmission Corporation from 2013 to 2019. Mr. Grubbs holds a BBA in business administration and marketing from the University of Missouri. 
 Ms. Ellen Havdala was appointed to our Board of Directors in connection with our initial public offering. Ms. Havdala is a Managing Director with EGI and has worked in a variety of capacities for Mr. Zells affiliated companies since 1990. Ms. Havdala serves on the board of Ardent Health Services, a provider of hospital and healthcare services. Ms. Havdala focuses on sourcing potential investment transactions and meeting new capital sources. In addition, Ms. Havdala is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Zell Global Entrepreneurship Network, an organization designed to provide continuing education and mentorship for students and alumni of Mr. Zells three entrepreneurship education programs.

Ms. Havdala graduated magna cum laude with a BA from Harvard College, and earned her Master of Divinity from the University of Chicago in 2016. 
 Mr. Bill Simon was appointed to our Board of Directors in connection with our initial public offering. Mr. Simon most recently served as Executive Vice President of Walmart and as President and Chief Executive Officer of Walmart U.S. from 2010 to 2014, and he remained a consultant to the firm through February 2015.

Mr. Swoboda graduated from Marquette University with a BS in Electrical Engineering. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial Business Combination with a company or companies that can benefit from our founders operational and investment expertise. Our selection process will leverage Messrs. Zell and Galvins broad and deep relationship network, unique industry experiences and deal sourcing capabilities to access a broad spectrum of differentiated opportunities. This network has been developed through our founders demonstrated success both investing in and operating businesses across a variety of industries, developing a distinctive combination of capabilities including: 

 | a track record of growing multi-billion dollar platforms in the public and private markets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | identifying potential market dislocations, including counter-intuitive investment opportunities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | partnering with management teams and business owners to drive sustainable, long-term value;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | driving innovation and increasing technology adoption throughout organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | implementing operational improvement initiatives and executing turnarounds;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | executing transformational and smaller M&A transactions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | driving strategic capital allocation decisions at the corporate level;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4 


 
 | understanding public market performance and requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | cultivating deep relationships with sellers, financing providers and target management teams; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | an extensive history of accessing the capital markets across various business cycles, including financing businesses and assisting companies with transition to public ownership.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Criteria 
 Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but given the right opportunity, we may decide to enter into our initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that we believe: 

 | have a strong competitive position, in an industry where technology plays an increasingly important role;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | have potential for attractive free cash flow characteristics and a desirable return on capital;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | have a strong management team that would benefit from our network or capabilities, such as additional management expertise, operational changes to drive improved financial performance, capital structure optimization or acquisition expertise;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | are fundamentally sound companies with a proven track record;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | can benefit from being a publicly traded company, are prepared to be a publicly traded company and can utilize access to broader capital markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines our management may deem relevant. In the event we decide to enter into our initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial Business Combination, which would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials we would file with the SEC. 
 In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions. Our management also sees significant opportunity to pursue acquisitions across a broader set of industries, capabilities and product scope than the activities of our affiliates today. 
 Initial Business Combination 
 In accordance with the rules of the NYSE, our initial Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial Business Combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to satisfaction of such criteria. Our stockholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial Business Combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial Business Combination solely with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
 
5 


 We anticipate structuring our initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial Business Combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable. 
 To the extent we effect our initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Business Combination. 
 Potential Conflicts of Interest 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another valuation or appraisal firm that commonly renders fairness opinions that our initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Our founders and directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial Business Combination.

 Mr. Bill Galvin, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, is currently restricted by non-compete arrangements with WESCO (as successor-in-interest to Anixter, a distributor of network and security solutions, electrical and electronic solutions and utility power solutions), which arrangements will be in effect until June 22, 2022, and which prohibit him from competing with the business of Anixter, its subsidiaries and affiliates. Our Chief Executive Officer is party to non-compete arrangements that will limit the types of companies that we can target for an initial Business Combination, among other restrictions, which could limit our prospects for an initial Business Combination or make us a less attractive buyer to certain target companies. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity to such entities, including as described above. Accordingly, if any of our founders, officers or directors becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such Business Combination opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. 
 For more information, see Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate GovernanceConflicts of Interest. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our initial Business Combination 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial Business Combination. 
 Limitations on Redemptions 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking stockholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically 
 
7 


  require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our shares of outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires stockholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote unless stockholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with the NYSE rules. 
 If we held a stockholder vote to approve our initial Business Combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial Business Combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial Business Combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holder present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the terms of a letter agreement entered into with us, our sponsor and members of our management team have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering, in favor of our initial Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial Business Combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders founder shares, we would need 15,525,001, or 37.5%, of the 41,400,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial Business Combination in order to have our initial Business Combination approved. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will complete our initial Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, directors and each member of our management team, have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not completed an initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. 
 If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon the public announcement of our initial Business Combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial Business Combination. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial Business Combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of our Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of our Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our initial Business Combination If We Seek Stockholder Approval 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to the Excess Shares (as defined below). We believe this restriction discourages stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 
 However, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial Business Combination. 
 Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 
 Public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the Business Combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial Business Combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in 
 
9 


  order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the initial vote on the Business Combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial Business Combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the companys shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming stockholders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial Business Combination. 
 If our initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no initial Business Combination 
 Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that we will have only 24 months from our initial public offering to complete an initial Business Combination. If we have not completed an initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we do not complete an initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering.

 Our sponsor, directors and each member of our management team have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we do not complete an initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. However, if our sponsor, director or members of our management team acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we do not complete an initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering. 
 Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of the then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SECs penny stock rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $1,000,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account plus up to $100,000 of funds from the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 
 Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other 
 
11 


  consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Credit Suisse will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business that executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsors only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, if any, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that they have no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per share. 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $1,000,000 from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors, however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such stockholder. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of $1,000,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $1,000,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount. 
 Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice 
 
12 


  period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we do not complete our initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 
 If we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or winding-up petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy or insolvency laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders.

 Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete an initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with our initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (B) with respect to any other provisions relating to the rights of holders of our Class A common stock, or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial Business Combination. Public stockholders who redeem their shares of our Class A common stock in connection with a stockholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial Business Combination or liquidation if we have not completed an initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, with respect to such shares of our Class A common stock so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial Business Combination, a stockholders voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial Business Combination. 
Employees 
 We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs and intend to continue doing so until we have completed our initial Business Combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period may vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial Business Combination and the stage of the initial Business Combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination. 
Legal Proceedings 
 There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such, and we and the members of our management team have not been subject to any such proceeding in the 12 months preceding the date of this prospectus. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Report contains audited financial statements and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 
14 


 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS), depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial Business Combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. There is no assurance that any particular target business identified by us as a potential Business Combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential Business Combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such Business Combination. We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial Business Combination. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following September 18, 2025 (the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering), (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
