Item 1. Business
GENERAL
 DESC, a public utility headquartered in Cayce, South Carolina, is a South Carolina corporation organized in 1924. DESC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SCANA which, effective January 2019, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy.
 DESC is engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to approximately 744,000 customers in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. Additionally, DESC sells natural gas to approximately 392,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in South Carolina. DESC’s business experiences seasonal fluctuations, with generally higher sales of electricity during the summer and winter months because of air conditioning and heating requirements, and generally higher sales of natural gas during the winter months due to heating requirements. 
 GENCO owns a coal-fired electric generating station with a 605 MW net generating capacity (summer rating). GENCO’s electricity is sold exclusively to DESC, pursuant to a FERC-approved power purchase agreement and related operating agreement. The effects of these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for DESC's nuclear fuel, certain fossil fuels and emission and other environmental allowances.
 COMPETITION
 There is no competition for electric distribution or generation service within DESC's retail electric service territory in South Carolina and no such competition is currently permitted. However, competition from third-party owners for development, construction and ownership of certain transmission facilities in DESC’s service territory is permitted pursuant to Order 1000, subject to state and local siting and permitting approvals. This could result in additional competition to build and own transmission infrastructure in DESC’s service area in the future.
 Competition in DESC’s natural gas distribution operations is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and the ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers.
 REGULATION
 DESC’s electric distribution service, including the rates it may charge to jurisdictional customers, is subject to regulation by the South Carolina Commission. DESC’s electric generation operations are subject to regulation by the South Carolina Commission, FERC, the NRC, the EPA, the DOE and various other federal, state and local authorities. DESC’s electric transmission service is primarily regulated by FERC and the DOE. DESC’s gas distribution operations are subject to regulation by the South Carolina Commission, as well as PHMSA, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the ORS for enforcement of federal and state pipeline safety requirements in its service territories.
Electric Regulation in South Carolina
 DESC’s retail electric base rates in South Carolina are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to South Carolina statutes and the rules and procedures of the South Carolina Commission. South Carolina base rates are set by a process that allows DESC to recover its operating costs and a return on invested capital. If retail electric earnings exceed the authorized ROE established by the South Carolina Commission, retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction, which may decrease DESC’s future earnings. Additionally, if the South Carolina Commission does not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis, DESC’s future earnings could be negatively impacted. Fuel costs are reviewed annually by the South Carolina Commission, as required by statute, and fuel rates are subject to revision in these annual fuel proceedings.
 
DESC offers to its retail electric customers several DSM programs designed to assist customers in reducing their demand for electricity and improving their energy efficiency. DESC submits annual filings to the South Carolina Commission related to these programs. As actual DSM program costs are incurred, they are deferred as regulatory assets and recovered through a rider approved by the South Carolina Commission. The rider also provides for recovery of any net lost revenues and for a shared savings incentive.
 
In connection with the SCANA Combination, DESC agreed not to file a general rate case with the South Carolina Commission with a requested rate effective date earlier than January 2021. Rate adjustments are permitted prior to 2021 for fuel and environmental costs, DSM costs and other rates routinely adjusted on an annual or biennial basis.
 
Gas Regulation in South Carolina
 DESC is subject to regulation of rates and other aspects of its natural gas distribution service by the South Carolina Commission.
 DESC provides retail natural gas service to customers in areas in which it has received authorization from the South Carolina
 Commission and in municipalities in which it holds a franchise. DESC’s base rates can be adjusted annually, pursuant to the RSA, for recovery of costs related to natural gas infrastructure. Base rates are set based on the cost-of-service by rate class approved by the 
 5

South Carolina Commission in the latest general rate case. Base rates for DESC are based primarily on a rate design methodology in which the majority of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges. DESC also utilizes a weather normalization adjustment to adjust its base rates during the winter billing months for residential and commercial customers to mitigate the effects of unusually cold or warm weather.
 
In addition, DESC’s natural gas tariffs include a purchased gas adjustment that provides for the recovery of prudently incurred gas costs, including transportation costs. DESC is authorized to adjust its purchased gas rates monthly and makes routine filings with the South Carolina Commission to provide notification of changes in these rates. Costs that are under or over recovered are deferred as regulatory assets or liabilities, respectively, and considered in subsequent purchased gas adjustments. The purchased gas adjustment filings generally cover a prospective twelve-month period. Increases or decreases in purchased gas costs can result in corresponding changes in purchased gas adjustment rates and the revenue generated by those rates. The South Carolina Commission annually reviews DESC’s gas purchasing policies and practices, including its administration of the purchased gas adjustment.
 EMPLOYEES
 At December 31, 2019, DESC had approximately 2,500 employees, of which approximately 750 were subject to collective bargaining agreements.
