ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
We are a leading asset-right transportation and asset-light logistics service provider offering a suite of solutions under the Roadrunner and Ascent Global Logistics brands. The Roadrunner brand offers less-than-truckload and truckload services. Ascent Global Logistics offers domestic freight management and brokerage, international freight forwarding, customs brokerage and premium mission critical air and ground expedite solutions. We serve a diverse customer base in terms of end-market focus and annual freight expenditures. We are headquartered in Downers Grove, Illinois with operations primarily in the United States.
Effective April 1, 2019, we changed our segment reporting to separate our Ascent On-Demand air and ground expedite business from our truckload business. Segment information for all prior periods has been revised to align with the new segment structure. 
Our four segments are as follows:
Ascent Global Logistics. Within our Ascent Global Logistics (or “Ascent”) business, we offer a full portfolio of domestic and international transportation and logistics solutions, including access to cost-effective and time-sensitive modes of transportation within our broad network. Our Ascent business is reported in two segments.

• | Our Ascent Transportation Management segment (“Ascent TM”) provides domestic freight management solutions including asset-backed truckload brokerage, specialized/heavy haul, LTL shipment execution, LTL carrier rate negotiations, access to our Transportation Management System and freight audit/payment services. Ascent TM also provides clients with international freight forwarding, customs brokerage, regulatory compliance services and project and order management. Ascent TM serves its customers through either its direct sales force or through a network of independent agents. Our customized Ascent TM offerings are designed to allow our customers to reduce operating costs, redirect resources to core competencies, improve supply chain efficiency, and enhance customer service.


• | Our Ascent On-Demand segment (“Ascent OD”), formerly Active On-Demand, provides ground and air expedited services featuring proprietary bid technology, supported by our fleets of ground and air assets. We specialize in the transport of automotive and industrial parts. On-Demand air charter is the segment of the air cargo industry focused on the time-critical movement of goods that requires the timely launch of an aircraft to move freight. These critical movements of freight are typically necessary to prevent a disruption in the supply chain due to lack of components. The primary users of on-demand charter services are just-in-time manufacturers, including auto manufacturers, component manufacturers and heavy equipment makers.

Less-than-Truckload. Our Less-than-Truckload (“LTL”) segment involves the pickup, consolidation, linehaul, deconsolidation, and delivery of LTL shipments throughout the United States and parts of Canada. With a large network of LTL service centers and third-party pick-up and delivery agents, we are designed to provide customers with high reliability at an economical cost. We generally employ a point-to-point LTL model that we believe serves as a competitive advantage over the traditional hub and spoke LTL model in terms of fewer handlings and reduced fuel consumption.
Truckload. Within our Truckload (“TL”) segment we serve customers throughout North America. We provide the following services: scheduled and expedited dry van truckload, temperature controlled truckload and other transportation and warehouse operations. We specialize in the transport of automotive and industrial parts, frozen and refrigerated foods, including dairy, poultry, meat, beverages and other consumer products. Our dry van and temperature controlled businesses provide specialized truckload services to beneficial cargo owners, freight management partners and brokers.
Our Industry
Over-the-Road Freight
The over-the-road freight sector includes both private fleets (Company drivers) and “for-hire” carriers. According to the American Trucking Associations (“ATA”), the U.S. freight sector represented revenue of approximately $833.7 billion in 2019 and accounted for approximately 80% of domestic freight transportation spend. The ATA estimates that U.S. freight transportation will increase to over $1.6 trillion by 2030. Private fleets consist of tractors and trailers owned and operated by shippers that move their own goods and, according to the ATA, accounted for revenue of approximately $374.9 billion in 2019. For-hire carriers transport truckload and LTL freight belonging to others and, according to the ATA, accounted for revenue of approximately $458.8 billion in 2019.
Truckload carriers generally dedicate an entire trailer to one shipper from origin to destination and are categorized by the type 
1


of equipment they use to haul a shipper’s freight, such as temperature-controlled, dry van, tank, or flatbed trailers. According to the ATA, excluding private fleets, revenue in the U.S. Truckload market was approximately $394.6 billion in 2019.
LTL carriers specialize in consolidating shipments from multiple shippers into truckload quantities for delivery to multiple destinations. LTL carriers are traditionally divided into two categories — national and regional. National carriers typically focus on two-day or longer service across distances greater than 1,000 miles, while regional carriers typically offer delivery in less than two days. According to the ATA, the U.S. LTL market generated revenue of approximately $64.2 billion in 2019. 
On Demand Air Charter
On-demand air charter is the segment of the air cargo industry focused on the time critical movement of goods that requires the timely launch of an aircraft to move freight. These critical movements of freight are typically necessary to prevent a disruption in the supply chain due to lack of components. There are approximately 50 certified airlines providing on-demand service in North America. The primary users of on-demand air charter services are just-in-time manufacturers, including auto manufacturers, component manufacturers and heavy equipment makers.
Third-Party Logistics
Third-party logistics (“3PL”) providers offer transportation management solutions and distribution services, including the movement and storage of freight and the assembly of inventory. The U.S. 3PL sector revenue increased from approximately $113.6 billion in 2006 to approximately $213.5 billion in 2018 (and experienced growth each year during such period other than from 2008 to 2009), according to Armstrong & Associates, Inc., a leading supply chain market research firm. In addition, only 13.0% of logistics expenditures by U.S. businesses were outsourced in 2018, according to Armstrong & Associates. In fiscal 2018, U.S. 3PL sector revenues were approximately $213.5 billion, a 15.8% increase from approximately $184.3 billion in 2017. We believe that the market penetration of 3PL providers will expand in the future as companies increasingly redirect their resources to core competencies and outsource their transportation and logistics requirements as they realize the cost-effectiveness of 3PL providers.
Factors Important to Our Business
Our success principally depends on our ability to generate revenues through our dedicated sales personnel, long-standing Company relationships, and independent agent network and to deliver freight in all modes safely, on time, and cost-effectively through a suite of solutions tailored to the needs of each customer. Customer shipping demand, over-the-road freight tonnage levels, events leading to expedited shipping requirements, and equipment capacity ultimately drive increases or decreases in our revenues. Our ability to operate profitably and generate cash is also impacted by purchased transportation costs, personnel and related benefits costs, fuel costs, pricing dynamics, customer mix, and our ability to manage costs effectively.
Sales Personnel and Agent Network. In our TL business, we arrange the pickup and delivery of freight either through our direct sales force or other Company relationships including management, dispatchers, or customer service representatives. In our LTL business, we market and sell our LTL services through a sales force of over 60 people, consisting of account executives, sales managers, inside sales representatives, and commissioned sales representatives. In our Ascent business, we have approximately 50 direct salespeople located in 23 Company offices, commissioned sales representatives, and a network of approximately 60 independent agents. Agents complement our Company sales force by bringing pre-existing customer relationships, new customer prospects, and/or access to new geographic markets. Furthermore, agents typically provide immediate revenue and do not require us to invest in incremental overhead. Agents own or lease their own office space and pay for other costs associated with running their operations.
Tonnage Levels and Capacity. Competition intensifies in the transportation industry as tonnage levels decrease and equipment capacity increases. Our ability to maintain or grow existing tonnage levels is impacted by overall economic conditions, shipping demand, over-the-road freight capacity in North America, and capacity in domestic air freight, as well as by our ability to compete effectively in terms of pricing, safety, and on-time delivery. We do business with a broad base of third-party carriers, including independent contractors (“ICs”) and purchased power providers, together with a blend of our own ground and air capacity, which reduces the impact of tightening capacity on our business.
Purchased Transportation Costs. Purchased transportation costs within our TL business are generally based either on negotiated rates for each load hauled or spot market rates for ground transportation services. Purchased transportation costs within our LTL business represent payments to ICs, over-the-road purchased power providers, intermodal service providers, brokers and agents, based on a combination of contractually agreed-upon and spot market rates. Within our Ascent business, purchased transportation costs represent payments made to ground, ocean, and air carriers, ICs, brokers and agents, based on a combination of contractually agreed-upon and spot market rates. Purchased transportation costs are the largest component of our cost structure. Our purchased transportation costs typically increase or decrease in proportion to revenues.
Personnel and Related Benefits. Personnel and related benefits costs are a large component of our overall cost structure. We employ approximately 800 Company drivers who are paid either per mile or at an hourly rate. In addition, we employ approximately 
2


800 dock and warehouse workers and approximately 2,000 operations and other administrative personnel to support our day-to-day business activities. Personnel and related benefits costs could vary significantly as we may be required to adjust staffing levels to match our business needs.
Fuel. The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies and the price of fuel. Fuel prices have fluctuated dramatically over recent years. Within our TL and Ascent businesses, we generally pass fuel costs through to our customers. As a result, our operating income in these businesses is less impacted by changes in fuel prices. Within our LTL business, our ICs and purchased power providers pass along the cost of diesel fuel to us, and we in turn attempt to pass along some or all of these costs to our customers through fuel surcharge revenue programs. Although revenues from fuel surcharges generally offset increases in fuel costs, other operating costs have been, and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. The total impact of higher energy prices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. We cannot predict future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of higher energy prices on other cost elements, recoverability of higher fuel costs through fuel surcharges, and the effect of fuel surcharges on our overall rate structure or the total price that we will receive from our customers. Depending on the changes in the fuel rates and the impact on costs in other fuel- and energy-related areas, our operating margins could be impacted.
Pricing. The pricing environment in the transportation industry also impacts our operating performance. Within our TL business, we typically charge a flat rate negotiated on each load hauled. Pricing within our TL business is typically driven by shipment frequency and consistency, length of haul, and customer and geographic mix, but generally has fewer influential factors than pricing within our LTL business. Within our LTL business, we typically generate revenues by charging our customers a rate based on shipment weight, distance hauled, and commodity type. This amount is comprised of a base rate, a fuel surcharge, and any applicable accessorial fees and surcharges. Our LTL pricing is dictated primarily by factors such as shipment size, shipment frequency, length of haul, freight density, customer requirements and geographical location. Within our Ascent business, we typically charge a variable rate on each shipment in addition to transaction or service fees appropriate for the solution we have provided to meet a specific customer’s needs. Since we offer both truckload and LTL shipping as part of our Ascent offering, pricing within our Ascent business is impacted by similar factors. The pricing environment for all of our operations generally becomes more competitive during periods of lower industry tonnage levels and/or increased capacity within the over-the-road freight sector. In addition, when we provide international freight forwarding services in our Ascent business, we also contract with airlines, ocean carriers, and agents as needed. The international shipping markets are very dynamic and we must therefore adjust rates regularly based on market conditions.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to be the leading asset-right transportation and asset-light logistics service provider in North America. Our strategy includes:
Gain New Customers. Our goal is to expand our customer base and increase our market share in the Ascent TM, Ascent OD and LTL markets. Our expansive geographic reach and broad service offering provides us with the ability to add new customers seeking transportation and logistics solutions. We also believe the pool of potential new customers will grow as the benefits of third-party transportation management solutions continue to be embraced.
Increase Penetration with Existing Customers. With our comprehensive service offering and large global network, we have substantial cross-selling opportunities and the potential to capture a greater share of existing customers' annual transportation and logistics expenditures. 
Increase Levels of Integration. We adopted a long-term brand and go-to-market service offering plan in the fourth quarter of 2016. Over the next three years, in order to implement this plan, we expect to increase the level of integration within each of our four segments in order to improve our ability to serve customers. For example, in November of 2016, we re-branded our Roadrunner LTL business as Roadrunner Freight and in January of 2017, we re-branded our Global Solutions business as Ascent Global Logistics. In the first quarter of 2018, we announced the integration and rebranding of several operating companies, including Roadrunner Truckload Plus, into Ascent Global Logistics and in the second quarter of 2018, we restructured our temperature-controlled truckload business by completing the integration of multiple operating companies into one operating unit. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we began a de-emphasis and divestiture of our TL business. These are first steps in the implementation of our long-term brand and go-to-market service offering plan. In the first quarter of 2020, we re-branded our Active On-Demand air and ground expedite business as Ascent On-Demand.
Generate Free Cash Flows. Our scalable business model and low capital expenditures (as a percentage of our revenues) enhance our ability to generate free cash flows and returns on our invested capital and assets.
Focus on Logistics and Asset-Right LTL Businesses. We plan to divest our business in the Truckload segment and narrow our strategic focus to the value-added logistics and asset-right LTL businesses. The goal of this strategy is to improve our operating performance, increase our returns on invested capital, and add significant value-creation opportunities.

Our Services
We are a leading asset-right transportation and asset-light logistics service provider offering a full suite of solutions. In each of our service offerings, we utilize a blend of Company-owned and third-party owned equipment to provide the most cost-effective service for our customers. Because of this blend, we are able to focus primarily on providing quality service rather than on asset utilization. Our customers generally communicate their freight needs to one of our transportation specialists on a shipment-by-shipment basis via telephone, fax, Internet, e-mail, electronic data interchange (“EDI”), or Application Programming Interface (“API”). We leverage a diverse group of third-party carriers and ICs to provide scalable capacity and reliable service to our extensive customer base in North America.
Ascent Global Logistics 
Ascent provides domestic freight management, international freight forwarding, and expedite transportation for ground, air charter, air freight and haul carry. We provide the necessary operational expertise, information technology capabilities, and relationships with third-party transportation providers to meet the unique needs of our customers. For customers that require the most comprehensive service plans, we complement their internal logistics and transportation management personnel and operations, enabling them to redirect resources to core competencies, reduce internal transportation management personnel costs, and, in many cases, achieve substantial annual freight savings. Key aspects of our Ascent capabilities include the following:

• | Sales. We have Company brokers that not only engage in the routing and selection of our transportation providers, but also supplement our internal Ascent sales force. Company brokers are responsible for managing existing customer relationships and generating new customer relationships. We also maintain a network of independent brokerage agents, who primarily focus on truckload shipments, which complement our network of Company brokers by bringing pre-existing customer relationships, new customer prospects, and/or access to new geographic markets. Furthermore, they typically provide immediate revenue and do not require us to invest in incremental overhead. Brokerage agents own or lease their own office space and pay for their own communications equipment, insurance, and any other costs associated with running their operation. We invest in the working capital required to execute our quick pay strategy and generally pay a commission to our brokerage agents of the margin we earn on an Ascent shipment. Similar to Company brokers, our brokerage agents engage in the routing and selection of transportation providers for our customer base and perform sales and customer service functions on our behalf. We believe we offer brokerage agents an attractive partnership opportunity as we offer access to our reliable network of purchased power providers and we invest in the working capital required to pay these carriers promptly and assume collection responsibility. As of December 31, 2019, our brokerage agent network consisted of over 60 agents. Additionally, 17 of our brokerage agents generated more than $1 million in revenue in 2019. We believe our increased development efforts and attractive value proposition will allow us to further expand our brokerage agent network and enhance the growth of our Ascent business.


• | Procurement. After a consultation and analysis with our customer to identify cost savings opportunities, we develop an estimate of our customer’s potential savings and design a plan for implementation. If necessary, we manage a targeted bid process based on the customer’s traffic lanes, shipment volumes, and product characteristics, and negotiate rates with reputable carriers. In addition to a cost-efficient rate, the customer receives a summary of projected savings as well as our carrier recommendation.


• | Shipment Planning. Utilizing our technology systems and an expansive multi-modal network of third-party transportation providers, we determine the appropriate mode of transportation and select the ideal provider. In addition, we provide load optimization services based on freight patterns and consolidation opportunities. We also provide rating and routing services, either on-site with one of our transportation specialists, through our centralized truckload pricing, or through our website.


• | Customs Brokerage Services. We provide customs brokerage services to clients importing goods. Our team of highly knowledgeable professionals assist importers in meeting all requirements governing imports by maintaining a detailed knowledge of all customs regulations, tariff schedules, proper classifications, dutiable values, quotas, and other admissibility requirements with other government agency requirements such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (“FWS”). We submit all required documentation and make appropriate payments to the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) on behalf of our clients and charge them a fee for this service. We also can provide foreign-trade zone entries/withdrawals and facilitate all in-bond entry types. In addition to processing documents for import clearance and payment of duties, our knowledgeable staff can assist with customs compliance issues, provide information on C-TPAT certification, assist with import bonds, and provide duty drawback services.


• | International Freight Forwarding. We provide comprehensive air (import/export) and ocean (import/export) freight forwarding solutions. For customers requiring ocean freight solutions, we are an Ocean Transportation Intermediary acting as either an ocean freight forwarder (arranging ocean shipments on our client’s behalf on their ocean contracts) or a non-

4


vessel-operating common carrier (moving shipments on our ocean carrier contracts). We provide full-container-load, less-than-container-load, charters, bulk, refrigerated service, or other unique solutions based on our customers' requirements. For customers requiring air freight solutions, we can provide express, standard and deferred air freight service. We arrange airport-to-airport, airport-to-door, door-to-airport, or door-to-door shipments. We are well-versed in the many technical aspects of government regulations, state and commerce department licensing requirements, foreign government forms, transportation documents, and international collection and banking procedures. We are an authorized International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) agent and also an Indirect Air Carrier authorized by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”). We also provide clients a robust Order Management Solution that includes Vendor Compliance/Education, Purchase Order Management, Regulatory Compliance Management, Origin Logistics, Transportation Management (Origin/Destination), and Global Information Management.

• | Shipment Execution. Our transportation specialists are adept at managing all types of shipments (full truckload, LTL, partial truckload, expedited, and specialized). With our technology and large carrier base, we are able to provide our clients with route, rate, and mode optimization to reduce their costs and meet their pickup and delivery requirements. We also provide the ability to track and trace shipments either online or by phone through one of our transportation specialists.


• | Audit and Payment Services. We capture and consolidate our customers’ entire shipping activity and offer weekly electronic billing. We also provide freight bill audit and payment services designed to eliminate excessive or incorrect charges from our customers’ bills.


• | Performance Reporting and Improvement Analysis. Customers utilizing our web reporting system have the ability to review freight bills, develop customized reports online, and access data to assist in financial and operational reporting and planning. Our specialists are also actively driving process improvement by using our technology to identify incremental savings opportunities and efficiencies for our customers.


• | Expedited solutions. We believe that we are a premier provider of expedite transportation for ground, air charter, airfreight and hand carry where we leverage over 25 years of managing on-demand air charter to create a culture with a sense of urgency across all service offerings. Ascent OD is committed to customer service and the execution of each and every mission. Ascent OD's portal solution provides market-driven pricing for clients on every shipment through proprietary spot bid technology. Our Ascent OD service offices are located in Belleville, Michigan at Willow Run Airport (HQ) and Aguascalientes, Mexico which manage all expedite transportation services for our clients.

With a broad Ascent offering, we believe we can accommodate a shipper’s unique needs with any combination of services along our entire spectrum, and cater to their preferred means of shipment processing and communication.
We believe our comprehensive service approach and focus on building long-term customer relationships lead to greater retention of existing business compared to a more short-term gain sharing model employed by many 3PL providers. Before becoming fully operational with a customer, we conduct thorough feasibility and cost savings analyses and collaborate with the customer to create a project scope and timeline with measurable milestones. We believe this approach enables us to identify potential issues, ensure a smooth integration process, and set the stage for long-term customer satisfaction. Within our Ascent operation, we have consistently met customer implementation deadlines and achieved anticipated levels of freight savings. 
Less-than-Truckload
We believe we are one of the largest asset-right providers of LTL transportation services in North America in terms of revenue. We provide LTL service originating from points within approximately 150 miles of our service centers to most destinations throughout the United States and parts of Canada. Within the United States, we offer national, long-haul service (1,000 miles or greater), inter-regional service (between 500 and 1,000 miles), and regional service (500 miles or less). We serve a diverse group of customers within a variety of industries, including retail, industrial, paper goods, manufacturing, food and beverage, health care, chemicals, computer hardware, and general commodities.
We use approximately 140 third-party LTL delivery agents to complement our service center footprint and to provide cost-effective full state, national, and North American delivery coverage. Delivery agents also enhance our ability to handle special needs of the final consignee, such as scheduled deliveries and specialized delivery equipment.
We generally utilize a point-to-point LTL model that is differentiated from the traditional, asset-based hub and spoke LTL model. Our model does not require intermediate handling at a break-bulk hub (a large terminal where freight is offloaded, sorted, and reloaded), which we believe represents a competitive advantage. 
5


Key aspects of our LTL service offering include the following:

• | Pickup. In order to stay as close as possible to our customers, we prefer to directly pick up freight whenever cost-effective. We generally directly pick up freight within 150 miles of one of our service centers, primarily utilizing local ICs. Although we generally do not own the tractors or other powered transportation equipment used to transport our customers’ freight, we own or lease trailers for use in local city pickup and delivery. In 2019, we picked up approximately 79% of our customers’ LTL shipments. The remainder was handled by agents with whom we generally have long-standing relationships.


• | Consolidation at Service Centers. Key to our model are our 27 LTL service centers that we lease in strategic markets throughout the United States. At these service centers, numerous smaller LTL shipments are unloaded, consolidated into truckload shipments, and loaded onto a linehaul unit scheduled for a destination city. In order to continuously emphasize optimal load building and enhance operating margins, dock managers review every load before it is dispatched from one of our service centers.


• | Linehaul. Linehaul is the longest leg of the LTL shipment process. In dispatching a load, a linehaul coordinator uses our technology system to optimize cost-efficiency and service by assigning the load to the appropriate IC, Company driver, or purchased power. In 2019, approximately 50% of our linehaul shipments were handled by over 350 ICs with the remainder shipped via Company driver, purchased power, or rail.


• | De-consolidation and Delivery. Within our unique model, linehaul shipments are transported to our service centers, delivery agents, or direct to end users without stopping at a break-bulk hub, as is often necessary under the traditional, asset-based hub and spoke LTL model. This generally reduces physical handling and damage claims. In 2019, we delivered approximately 46% of LTL shipments through our service centers and approximately 54% through our delivery agents.

Truckload
We provide a range of TL solutions for our customers by leveraging our Company drivers, ICs, and a broad base of third-party carriers who operate dry van and temperature-controlled capacity. We arrange the pickup and delivery of TL freight through our 30 TL service centers located throughout the United States. We provide a variety of transportation solutions for dry goods ranging from paper products to steel, refrigerated foods like meat, poultry and beverages. We track all shipments using our proprietary technology and our dedicated service team. 
Sales. Our senior management teams are responsible for managing existing customer relationships and generating new customer relationships. Because the performance of these individuals is essential to our success, we offer attractive incentive-based compensation packages that we believe keep our senior management teams motivated, focused, and service-oriented. We supplement our customer relationships with direct customer contact from our broader management teams, dispatchers or customer service representatives.
Capacity
We offer scalable capacity and reliable service to our extensive customer base in North America through a diverse third-party network of transportation providers and Company drivers and pilots. Our various transportation modes include Truckload, LTL, intermodal, and domestic and international air. Only one third-party carrier accounted for more than 3% of our 2019 purchased transportation costs. We ensure that each carrier is properly licensed and we regularly monitor each carrier's safety, capacity, reliability, and pricing trends. Enhanced visibility provided by our technology systems allows us to leverage the competitive dynamics within our network to renegotiate freight rates and provide our customers with more cost-effective transportation solutions while enhancing our operating margins.
We continuously focus on building and enhancing our relationships with reliable transportation providers to ensure that we not only secure competitive rates, but that we also gain access to consistent capacity. These relationships are critical to our success based on our asset-right transportation and asset-light logistics service provider business model. We typically pay our third-party carriers either a contracted per mile rate or the cost of a shipment less our contractually agreed-upon commission, and generally pay within seven to ten days from the date the shipment is delivered. We pay our third-party carriers promptly in order to drive loyalty and reliable capacity.
Our network of transportation providers can be divided into the following groups:
Independent Contractors. ICs are a key part of our long-term strategy to maintain service and provide cost stability. As of December 31, 2019, we had over 1,300 ICs, which consisted of over 900 linehaul and truckload and over 400 local delivery ICs. In selecting our ICs, we adhere to specific screening guidelines in terms of safety records, length of driving experience, and evaluations. In the event of tightening of over-the-road freight capacity, we believe we are well positioned to increase our utilization of ICs as a cost-effective and reliable solution.
6


To maintain our relationships with our ICs, we offer rates that we believe are competitive. In addition, we focus on keeping our ICs fully utilized in order to limit the number of “empty” miles they drive. We regularly communicate with our ICs and seek new ways to enhance their quality of life. We believe our efforts increase IC retention, which we believe ultimately leads to better service for our customers.
Purchased Power Providers. In addition to our large base of ICs, we have access to a broad base of purchased power providers. We have established relationships with carriers of all sizes, including large national trucking companies and small to mid-size regional fleets. With the exception of safety incentives, purchased power providers are generally paid under a similar structure as ICs within our LTL and TL businesses. In contrast to contracts established with our ICs, who operate under one of our DOT authorities, we do not cover the cost of liability insurance for our purchased power providers.
Company Drivers. We employ approximately 800 drivers across our businesses. 
Delivery Agents. For the de-consolidation and delivery stages of our LTL shipment process, our 27 LTL service centers are complemented by approximately 140 third-party delivery agents. The use of delivery agents is also a key part of our long-term strategy to maintain a variable cost and scalable operating model with minimal overhead.
Flight Operations. We support air freight services, including expedited delivery, with 12 cargo jets, 60 flight operations personnel, including pilots, ground crew, and flight coordinators, and a network of third party air cargo providers.
Ground Expedite. We utilize proprietary bid technology supported by our logistics personnel and our network of Company drivers, ICs and purchased power providers. 
Customers
Our goal is to establish long-term customer relationships and achieve year-over-year growth in recurring business by providing reliable, timely, and cost-effective transportation and logistics solutions. We possess the scale, operational expertise, and capabilities to serve shippers of all sizes. We serve an extensive customer base within a variety of end markets, with one direct customer, General Motors, accounting for approximately 16% of our 2019 revenue. Our diverse customer base reduces our exposure to a decline in shipping demand from any one customer and a cyclical downturn within any particular end market.
Sales and Marketing
We currently market and sell our transportation and logistics solutions through sales personnel located throughout the United States. We are focused on actively expanding our sales force to new geographic markets. 
We have a sales team consisting of both sales managers and inside sales representatives. We believe that this sales structure enables our salespeople to better serve our customers by developing an understanding of local, regional, national and international market conditions, as well as the specific transportation and logistics issues facing individual customers. Our sales team seeks additional business from existing customers and pursues new customers based on this knowledge and an understanding of the value proposition we can provide.
As of December 31, 2019, our sales force extends into each segment as follows:

• | Ascent TM. We have approximately 50 direct salespeople, Company brokers, and approximately 60 independent brokerage agents, commissioned sales representatives, and agents.


• | Ascent OD. Our direct sales force works in conjunction with Ascent TM and leverages Ascent TM's infrastructure of independent brokerage agents, commissioned sales representatives, and agents.


• | Less-than-Truckload. Our LTL sales team of over 60 people consists of account executives, sales managers, inside sales representatives, and commissioned sales representatives.


• | Truckload. Our direct sales force works in conjunction with direct customer contacts, management, dispatchers or customer service representatives.

Competition
We compete in the North American transportation and logistics services sector. Our marketplace is extremely competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with a large number of other asset-light logistics companies, asset-based carriers, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers, many of whom have larger customer bases and more resources than we do.
In our markets, we compete with global asset-based integrated logistics companies such as FedEx Corporation, United Parcel Service, Inc., and XPO Logistics, Inc., against whom we compete in all of our service lines; asset-based providers, such as ArcBest 
7


Corporation, Old Dominion Freight Line Inc., Werner Enterprises, Inc., and YRC Worldwide, Inc., against whom we compete in our core TL and LTL service offerings; non-asset based and asset-light freight brokerage companies, such as C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., Echo Global Logistics, Inc., Hub Group, Inc., Forward Air Corporation, and Landstar System, Inc., against whom we compete in all of our service offerings; 3PL providers that offer comprehensive transportation management solutions, such as Schneider Logistics, Inc. and Transplace, Inc., against whom we compete in our Ascent offering; and smaller, niche transportation and logistics companies that provide services within a specific geographic region or end market. In our international freight forwarding business, we compete with a large number of service providers. Depending on the trade lane and solution, these competitors include large multi-national providers, such as Expeditors International of Washington, Inc., Kuehne & Nagel International AG / ADR, and DHL Global Supply Chain; regional providers, such as Mallory Alexander International Logistics and Laufer Group International; and local or niche providers. As a result, our focus remains on continuing to provide our customers with exceptional service.
We believe we compete favorably by offering shippers attractive transportation and logistics solutions designed to deliver the optimal combination of cost and service. To that end, we believe our most significant competitive advantages include:

• | our comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics services, which allows us to offer à la carte or a full portfolio value proposition to shippers of varying sizes and to accommodate their diverse needs and preferred means of processing and communication;


• | our asset-right transportation and asset-light logistics service provider, variable cost business model, which will allow us to generate free cash flows and focus greater attention on providing optimal customer service than on asset utilization;


• | our technology systems, which allow us to provide scalable capacity and a high level of customer service across a variety of transportation modes; and


• | our knowledgeable management team with experience leading logistics companies and/or business units, which allows us to benefit from a collective entrepreneurial culture focused on growth.

Seasonality
Our operations are subject to seasonal trends that have been common in the North American over-the-road, ocean, and air freight sectors for many years. Typically, our results of operations for the quarter ending in March are on average lower than the quarters ending in June, September, and December. This pattern has been the result of factors such as inclement weather, national holidays, customer demand, and economic conditions. 
Technology
We believe the continued development and innovation of our technology systems is important to providing our customers with the most cost-effective, timely, and reliable transportation and logistics solutions. Our objective is to allow our customers and vendors to easily do business with us via technology. Our customers have the ability, through a paperless process, to receive immediate pricing, place orders, track shipments, process remittance, receive updates, and review historical shipping data through a variety of reports over the Internet. We provide flexibility for customers and vendors by utilizing multiple technologies, including web, mobile, workflow and EDI.
Our Ascent operation uses a variety of software applications and systems customized to meet the unique needs of our customers. We continuously enhance our applications and systems to help improve our productivity, increase customer visibility, and improve collaboration with our service providers, all while offering customizable content for our customers. Our web-based technology approach allows our Ascent operation to process and service customer orders, track shipments in real time, select optimal modes of transportation, execute customer billing, provide carrier rates, establish customer-specific profiles, and retain critical information for analysis while providing a Company branded solution.  We utilize this approach to maximize supply chain efficiency through mode, carrier, and route optimization.
Our expedited air and ground operations utilize proprietary bid technology, which provides customers with real-time market pricing and logistics options for time sensitive shipments, supported by our fleets of ground and air assets.
Our LTL operation utilizes a web-based system with our transportation management applications. Additionally, we make use of EDI and API's to allow our service centers to communicate electronically with our carriers’ and customers’ internal systems. We offer our customers a paperless process, including quoting, bills of lading, document imaging and shipment tracking and tracing. 
Our TL operations teams use technology to dispatch or broker our customers’ freight. Our software enhances our ability to track Company and third-party drivers, tractors, and trailers, which provides customers with visibility into their supply chains. Additionally, our systems allow us to operate as a paperless environment through electronic order entry, resource planning, and dispatch.

Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 3,600 full-time and part-time personnel, which included drivers, pilots, and warehouse, dock and maintenance workers as well as personnel in our management, sales and marketing, brokerage, logistics, customer service, operations, finance, information technology and human resources functions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
Regulation
The federal government substantially deregulated the provision of ground transportation and logistics services via the enactment of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, the Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994, and the ICC Termination Act of 1995. Prices and services are now largely free of regulatory controls, although states have the right to require compliance with safety and insurance requirements, and interstate motor carriers remain subject to regulatory controls imposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and its agencies, such as the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”). Motor carrier, freight forwarding, and freight brokerage operations are subject to safety, insurance, and bonding requirements prescribed by the DOT and various state agencies. Any air freight business is subject to commercial standards set forth by the IATA and federal regulations issued by the TSA.
We are also subject to the Compliance, Safety, and Accountability Program (“CSA”), which is the FMCSA safety program designed to improve large truck and bus safety and ultimately reduce crashes. CSA is an enforcement and compliance model that involves assessments of a motor carrier's on-road performance and investigation results for a 24-month period using roadside stops and inspections, resulting in safety performance in the following categories: unsafe driving; hours-of-service compliance; driver fitness; controlled substances/alcohol; vehicle maintenance; hazardous material compliance; and crash indicator. The evaluations are then used by the FMCSA to select carriers for audit and other interventions.
We own USA Jet Airlines (“USA Jet”), which holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 41102 and an air carrier certificate granted by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. The DOT, the FAA, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), through the TSA, have regulatory authority over USA Jet’s air transportation services. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, is the statutory basis for DOT and the FAA authority and the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, is the basis for TSA aviation security authority.
The FAA’s authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of USA Jet to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. The air carrier certificate granted to USA Jet by the FAA remains in effect so long as we meet the safety and operational requirements of the applicable FAA regulations. 
The DOT’s authority relates primarily to economic licensing aspects of air transportation. The DOT’s jurisdiction extends to authorized types of operations and aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. USA Jet holds various certificates issued by the DOT, including a domestic certificate authorizing USA Jet to engage in U.S. air transportation and a foreign certificate authorizing international air transportation of property. In addition, USA Jet is subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions, and non-U.S. customs regulation.
The TSA has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires USA Jet to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program and the Twelve-Five Standard Security Program, which contain evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. 
We are also subject to various environmental and safety requirements, including those governing the handling, disposal, and release of hazardous materials, which we may be asked to transport in the course of our operations. If hazardous materials are released into the environment while being transported, we may be required to participate in, or may have liability for response costs and the remediation of such a release. In such a case, we also may be subject to claims for personal injury, property damage, and damage to natural resources. Our business is also subject to changes in legislation and regulations, which can affect our operations and those of our competitors. For example, new laws and initiatives to reduce and mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions could significantly impact the transportation industry. Future environmental laws in this area could adversely affect our ICs’ costs and practices and, consequently, our operations.
We are also subject to regulations to combat terrorism that the DHS and other agencies impose. 
The international freight forwarding and customs brokerage services provided by our Ascent business are regulated by a variety of regulatory agencies and bodies including, but not limited to: the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”), the CBP and the TSA within the DHS (customs brokerage and security issues); the IATA; the DOT; the FDA; the USDA; the FWS; the Bureau of 
9


Alcohol, Tobacco Products and Firearms (“BATF”); the U.S. Census Bureau; and other agencies or world governing bodies regulating international trade and compliance. Regulations and requirements must be strictly adhered to and can change periodically. Additionally, our Ascent business manages customer activities in numerous countries. As such, there may be risk associated with sudden fluctuations in currency, changes in economic policy, political unrest, changes to tariffs and trade policies/restrictions that are all outside of our control. Compliance with these changes may have a material impact on our operations and may increase our costs to service our customers.
Insurance
We insure our ICs and Company drivers against third-party claims for accidents or damaged shipments and we bear the risk of such claims. We maintain insurance for auto liability, general liability, and cargo damage claims. We maintain an aggregate of $100 million of auto liability and general liability insurance. We maintain auto liability insurance coverage for claims in excess of $1.0 million per occurrence and cargo coverage for claims in excess of $100,000 per occurrence. If our insurance does not cover all or any portion of the claim amount, we may be forced to bear the financial loss. We attempt to mitigate this risk by carefully selecting IC's and Company drivers using quality control procedures employing safety assessments.
In addition to auto liability, general liability, and cargo claim coverage, our insurance policies also cover other standard industry risks related to workers’ compensation and other property and casualty risks. We are self-insured up to $1.0 million per occurrence for workers compensation. We believe our insurance coverage is comparable in terms and amount of coverage to other companies in our industry. We establish insurance reserves for anticipated losses and expenses and periodically evaluate and adjust the reserves to reflect current trends and our historical experience.
Financial Information About Segments
See Note 16, “Segment Reporting” to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for financial information about our segments. Effective April 1, 2019, we changed our segment reporting to separate our Ascent OD (formerly Active On-Demand) air and ground expedite business from our truckload business. Segment information for prior periods has been revised to align with the new segment structure. 
Significant Events in Fiscal Year 2019
Rights Offering
On February 26, 2019, we closed our previously announced fully backstopped $450 million rights offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 36 million new shares of our common stock at the subscription price of $12.50 per share. An aggregate of 7,107,049 shares of our common stock were purchased pursuant to the exercise of basic subscription rights and over-subscription rights from stockholders of record during the subscription period, including from the exercise of basic subscription rights by stockholders who are affiliates of Elliott Management Corporation (“Elliott”). In addition, Elliott purchased an aggregate of 28,892,951 additional shares pursuant to the previously announced commitment from Elliott to purchase all unsubscribed shares of our common stock in the rights offering pursuant to a standby purchase agreement (the “Standby Purchase Agreement”) that we entered into with Elliott dated November 8, 2018, as amended (the “backstop commitment”). Overall, Elliott purchased a total of 33,745,308 shares of our common stock in the rights offering between its basic subscription rights and the backstop commitment, and following the closing of the rights offering beneficially owned approximately 90.4% of our common stock.
The net proceeds from the rights offering and backstop commitment were used to fully redeem the outstanding shares of our preferred stock and to pay related accrued and unpaid dividends. Proceeds were also used to pay fees and expenses in connection with the rights offering and backstop commitment. We retained in excess of $30 million of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. The purpose of the rights offering was to improve and simplify our capital structure in a manner that gave our existing stockholders the opportunity to participate on a pro rata basis.
Stockholders’ Agreement
On February 26, 2019, we entered into a Stockholders’ Agreement with Elliott (the “Stockholders’ Agreement”).

Our execution and delivery of the A&R Registration Rights Agreement was a condition to Elliott’s backstop commitment.

Trading of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange
On October 4, 2018, we received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) that we had fallen below the NYSE’s continued listing standards relating to minimum average global market capitalization and total stockholders’ investment, which require that either our average global market capitalization be not less than $50 million over a consecutive 30 trading day period, or our total stockholders’ investment be not less than $50 million. Pursuant to the NYSE continued listing standards, we timely notified the NYSE that we intended to submit a plan to the NYSE demonstrating how we intended to regain compliance with the continued listing standards within the required 18-month time frame. We timely submitted our plan, which was subsequently accepted by the NYSE. During the 18-month cure period, our shares continued to be listed and traded on the NYSE, subject to our compliance with other listing standards. The NYSE notification did not affect our business operations or our reporting requirements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
On October 12, 2018, we received a notice from the NYSE that we had fallen below the NYSE’s continued listing standard related to price criteria for common stock, which requires the average closing price of our common stock to equal at least $1.00 per share over a 30 consecutive trading day period. The NYSE notification did not affect our business operations or our SEC reporting requirements. As a result of our 1-for- 25 Reverse Stock Split that took effect on April 4, 2019, we received a notice from the NYSE on April 12, 2019 that a calculation of our average stock price for the 30-trading days ended April 12, 2019, indicated that our stock price was above the NYSE's minimum requirements of $1.00 based on a 30-trading day average. Accordingly, we are now in compliance with the $1.00 continued listed criterion. On September 10, 2019, we received a notice from the NYSE that we were back in compliance with the NYSE quantitative listing standards. This decision came as a result of our achievement of compliance with the NYSE's minimum market capitalization and stockholders' equity requirements over the prior two consecutive quarters. 
All references to numbers of common shares and per common share data in this Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted to account for the effects of the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented.
See Note 6, “Debt” to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the ABL Credit Facility, the Term Loan Credit Facility, the Fee Letter, and the Third Lien Credit Facility.
