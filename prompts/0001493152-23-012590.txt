Item 1. Business
 
We are a medical technology company with a mission to dramatically improve the cancer landscape with a modern solution for the early detection of multiple cancers thereby expanding the therapeutic window, significantly improving survivability, and reducing the cost of healthcare. One in two Americans will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and one in five will die. Clinical literature shows that early detection can save lives and money. We operate at the confluence of our Electrical Impedance Analytics (EIA) technology or bioimpedance and artificial intelligence (AI). We are developing an advanced multi-cancer screening technology for early detection of multiple cancers that may expand the therapeutic window, dramatically improve survivability and reduce the cost of healthcare. We have active projects in lung, breast and gastro-intestinal (GI) cancers. The first planned product utilizing our proprietary digital platform, the IONIQ ProLung Test™ for lung cancer, has been designated a Breakthrough Device by the U.S. FDA in February 2020. We submitted our de novo application to the U.S. FDA in February 2022 and we received a substantive review from the FDA outlining additional information that is required for US regulatory clearance. These items include questions and requests related to biocompatibility testing, clinical data, Indications for Use and labeling, cybersecurity documentation, electrical safety, special controls, human factors and usability, performance testing, risk analysis, software, sterility and shelf life. We remain fully-committed to gaining U.S. FDA regulatory de novo clearance and continue to collaborate with the US FDA so that we can satisfy their requests and subsequently commercialize the IONIQ ProLung Test for lung cancer.
 
Our non-invasive, rapid and radiation-free IONIQ ProLung Test developed to assess the risk of malignancy in lung nodules found in the chest by a Computed Tomography “CT” scan, which is currently the primary method used in the United States (“US”) for screening lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US and the world according to American Cancer Society and World Health Organization. Earlier detection makes a substantial improvement in survival in individuals at high risk of lung cancer. Timely identification of malignancy is essential for patients and their families. Currently, patients often wait from three months to three and one-half years to have the risk of malignancy assessed through periodic CT scan surveillance. Until malignancy is determined to be likely, invasive biopsy and treatment are typically delayed. Current statistics reflect an average 17% survival rate at five years for those diagnosed with lung cancer.
 
We believe the IONIQ ProLung Test, in conjunction with the discovery of a nodule by CT scan, provides a more rapid assessment of the risk of malignancy, which must be determined prior to biopsy. Since a lung biopsy is invasive and may require life threatening thoracic surgery, physicians, patients, and insurance companies typically delay biopsy and therapy until the risk of malignancy outweighs the risk of further diagnostic procedures. For these patients, the delay can reduce the time available to treat the tumor and may cause sustained emotional trauma.
 
The IONIQ ProLung Test is designed to enable the practitioner to promptly assess the risk of malignancy in patients with lung nodules. The IONIQ ProLung Test utilizes bioimpedance technology or Electrical Impedance Analytics (EIA). Our Bioimpedance technology involves a sequential scanning process that measures significant differences in electrical conductance between patients with cancerous and benign tissue. We plan to introduce the IONIQ ProLung Test to the market as a standard predictive analytic test, without the need for transmission of a physical sample or specimen to a lab for analysis.

The IONIQ ProLung Test acquires bioimpedance measurement data by means of a patented probe and disposable diaphoretic or EKG-type electrodes placed on the patient’s back and arms. The IONIQ ProLung Test registers and evaluates measurement data derived from numerous pathways through the chest and is processed by a predictive analytic algorithm. The results are summarized in a report that can be used by the physician, in concert with other risk factors such as nodule size, family history, smoking history and gender, to evaluate patients with nodules. The IONIQ ProLung Test requires minimal preparation and can be completed in about 20 minutes. Most importantly, it guides or informs the physician’s decision making without the time consuming and expensive watchful waiting period. We believe the IONIQ ProLung Test provides considerable cost savings when compared with today’s status quo of patients undergoing repeated CT imaging studies and potentially unnecessary surgery.
 
ProLung dba IONIQ Sciences owns the intellectual property and established the clinical research plan for the IONIQ ProLung Test. Beginning in 2005, we embarked on clinical research which revealed the potential of our technology. In 2011, our research demonstrated the utility of the IONIQ ProLung Test in lung cancer patients. To date, more than 1,400 subjects have been tested using the IONIQ ProLung Test at IONIQ’s headquarters and in major cancer centers. If our de novo U.S. FDA clearance is granted, of which there can be no assurance, we plan to transition the hospitals that participated in our clinical trials to commercial placements of the IONIQ ProLung Test System and consumable IONIQ ProLung Test kit.
 
In the US, the push for early detection of lung cancer was greatly accelerated in 2013 and again most recently in 2020. Recognizing the dismal rate of lung cancer survival in the US, and the potential value of early detection, U.S. guidelines were established for lung cancer CT screening. The guidelines provided for CT screening for lung cancer in asymptomatic adults aged 50 to 80 who have a 20 pack-year history of smoking and who currently smoke or have quit smoking in the past 15 years. This demographic group addresses a substantial portion of individuals of high risk of lung cancer. In 2020, the guidelines were expanded effectively doubling the population covered. The US health care industry has generally recognized the need for technologies that will provide for earlier detection of cancers at a lower cost. Genetic biomarkers, protein panels, and breath analysis, among others, are in various stages of development. The IONIQ ProLung Test is the first bioimpedance technology that has been developed for the risk stratification of lung cancer. In February 2015, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced its coverage of lung cancer screening by CT. This newly reimbursed screening procedure increased the number of individuals with suspicious lung nodules who may be candidates for the IONIQ ProLung Test.
 
With the arrival of lung cancer screening recommendations, the large U.S. market and government-backed reimbursement represent near term opportunities to accelerate diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer while reducing invasive biopsies and costs. We made U.S. clearance and recognition of the IONIQ ProLung Test a major priority, targeting lung cancer risk stratification and reducing time to treatment. The IONIQ ProLung Test has been designated a Breakthrough Medical Device by the U.S. FDA in February 2020 based on the clinical trial results from PLW-216 and the ability of the device to detect lung cancer in small lung nodules. We intend to seek government-backed reimbursement after FDA clearance. We are also interested in improving the cost of diagnosis and treatment with capitated providers. We believe the IONIQ ProLung Test can be offered at a fraction of the cost of current standard of care, which is repeat periodic imaging studies.
 
We have developed the quality management system, as well as supply chain and the ability to fully manufacture the entire IONIQ System in our own Salt Lake City facility. We have received ISO 13485 and other clearances and made certain refinements to the intellectual property that will further our capabilities, especially the development of the underlying predictive analytic algorithm and refinements to various software and physical components. We have repeatedly expanded our intellectual property (IP) portfolio, completed the development of the IONIQ ProLung Test and manufacturing of the IONIQ System and embarked upon clinical trials to provide validation to the medical community.

The results of the clinical trial of 420 patients from 15 cancer and medical centers across the US, named PL-208, was published in early 2019. The results of another clinical trial of 486 patients from four cancer and medical centers in China, named PLW-216, was published in late 2019. We believe the results are more solid indicators that our IONIQ ProLung Test is capable of identifying a signal that can be used to indicate the risk of malignancy in pulmonary nodules by non-invasively measuring their bioconductance biomarker. With the conclusion of these Studies, the IONIQ Team is eager to turn its focus to validating a number of already identified hardware, software and data collection improvements designed to strengthen our algorithm’s performance and support a future submission to the FDA. The Company is also in the midst of evaluating a number of potential strategic partnerships to accelerate our development by expanding our financial and support network.
 
In late 2018, we announced final results of our Repeatability Study, named PL-209. The repeatability study enrolled sixty subjects, 30 male and 30 female, half of each gender with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more, and half with a BMI of 28 or less. Each subject was scanned twice on Day One and twice on Day Two. All scans were done by the same operator on the same IONIQ System. Fifty-nine subjects produced evaluable data. Four models (algorithms) were tested. The study was conducted by ProLung. Study objectives included quantifying the effects of gender, body mass index (BMI), day-to-day subject variability and variability of a single device when volume-averaged thoracic bioconductance was measured with the IONIQ ProLung Test. The repeatability study addressed several questions regarding use of the IONIQ ProLung Test. One significant limitation of this study is that no subjects with known pulmonary nodules or malignancy were enrolled. It is unknown whether pulmonary nodules or malignancy affect the repeatability of the IONIQ ProLung Test. While the study showed statistically significant variability of approximately 2% when testing the same subject twice on the same day, the clinical impact of this finding is unknown because it is not anticipated that patients will receive a second test on the same day in clinical use. While we note significant day-to-day variability when using an earlier model (the algorithm used in the Johns Hopkins Study, Journal of Thoracic Oncology, 2012), repeatability is markedly improved when using a more refined model.
 
In late 2019, we announced the final results of our Validation Study, named PLW-216. The validation study enrolled 486 subjects from four leading cancer and medical centers in China. The results were 84% sensitivity and 73% specificity in the 418 subjects included in the analysis.
 
In February 2020, the FDA designated the IONIQ ProLung Test a Breakthrough Device. Through the Breakthrough Device program, the FDA will provide ProLung with expedited reviews. This is not a marketing clearance.
 
PL-209 Study Conclusions
 

1. | Same-day variability is statistically significant (average second score is 0.0214 points lower), but the clinical impact of this finding is unclear. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Day-to-day variability is impacted by the model (algorithm) chosen. One particular model with age (model 1b+age) has an ICC=0.958, indicating it is very repeatable. 
3. | Gender and BMI do not affect test performance. 
4. | Average test time is 18.5 minutes, with a range of 15-24 minutes. 
5. | The test is well tolerated and agreeable to test subjects. 

PL-208 Study (2012-2019)
 
Three Validation studies have been completed for the IONIQ ProLung Test. The first is PL-208 which enrolled 420 patients across 15 US centers (ID: NCT01566682). This study was two-phased, with a 200-patient open-labelled training set to test and optimize an algorithm, followed by testing of the optimized algorithm on the diagnosis-blinded 174-patient validation set. Forty-six (46) subjects (11%) were excluded for being lost to follow up or having an inconclusive diagnosis, missing or inadequate device data. The predictive algorithm utilized the patient’s bioconductance measurements coupled with the patient’s age and a binary cut-off point of 0.5 was chosen to distinguish between high and low likelihood of cancer. The algorithm was locked and applied to a blinded validation set of 174 patients and yielded a Sensitivity of 69% Specificity of 49%, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 70%, Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 47% and overall Accuracy of 61%.

PLW-208 Study (2015-2016)
 
The second validation trial (PLW-208) was completed by the Company’s licensor (ProLung Wuxi). This study enrolled 138 subjects at 2 centers in China. This study was similar in design to the US PL-208 Study and obtained a Sensitivity of 77%, Specificity of 60%, PPV of 82%, NPV of 41% and an Accuracy of 73%. In reviewing this study, the Sponsor determined that test method and operator training needed to be improved to obtain better results.
PLW-216 Study (2017-2019)
 
Ultimately, the Study Sponsor (ProLung Wuxi) improved the device operator training, test method and device predictive algorithm. The Sponsor concluded the PLW-208 Study and initiated PLW-216, utilizing improved training, test method and a modified locked predictive algorithm. This PLW-216 Study was a single-phase validation study whereby the predictive algorithm was locked prior to the first patient being enrolled and the IONIQ ProLung Test results were provided to site investigators prior to knowing the subject’s actual diagnosis. The PLW-216 Study enrolled 486 subjects in China at 4 centers led by Dr. Bai, the Chair of the Chinese Alliance against lung Cancer and Director of the Shanghai Respiratory Research Institute (ID: NCT 02726633, registration No 20170226). The Validation Study demonstrated improved performance yielding a Sensitivity of 84% Specificity of 73%, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 78%, Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 80% and overall Accuracy of 79% from the US Study PL-208 (ID NCT0156668). This performance is comparable to other diagnostic cancer devices such as Mammogram (~sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 71%) and was demonstrated in a large sample size of 418 subjects included in the final analysis.
PL-210 - ProLung Test Measurement Collection Protocols for Label Expansion (Ongoing NCT04134520)
 
The purpose of this Study is to identify and test different data collection methods to determine which approaches may be useful in evaluation additional cancers to lung cancer (including breast cancer) and improve the ProLung Testing procedure. Once this Study is complete, the Sponsor plans to evaluate these improvements in future follow up cancer validation studies that will assess device accuracy using the new measurement collection methods.

Lung Cancer Market Summary
 
According to the American Cancer Society (“ACS”), lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women in the US; about one out of four cancer deaths in the US are from lung cancer. The ACS estimates that in 2017 more people in the United States will die of lung cancer than of colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined.
 
According to the World Health Organization (“WHO”), lung cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer worldwide and is estimated to be responsible for nearly one in five cancer related deaths. The overall ratio of mortality to incidence is 87%. Each year there are over 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer worldwide, as well as nearly 1.6 million deaths. The lifetime chance of developing lung cancer is 1:17 in women and 1:14 in men.
 
Until recently, asymptomatic lung cancer was detected only incidentally when looking for something else. Currently, a lung cancer screen now reimbursed by Medicare, is performed by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). This has led to a dramatic increase in number of individuals with lung nodules detected, which is intensifying the need for a risk stratification test such as the IONIQ ProLung Test.
 
Lung cancer patients face median five-year survival rates of only 17% (compared to 89% for breast cancer and 98% for prostate cancer). Survival rates of lung cancer lags behind that of other cancer rates due to a lack of early and effective detection, and a challenging biopsy. A significant amount of time is required to assess the risk under current guidelines. Should innovation reduce the time required for assessing the risk of malignancy, lung cancer mortality could approach that of other cancer rates. In those instances when lung cancer was detected in its earliest stage, the five-year survival improves to 80% or approximately an improvement of five times.
 
U.S. Market
 
Americans at high risk:
 

Region | Population (in millions) | | At high risk (in millions) | | Market Channel
--------------+--------------------------+-----+----------------------------+----+---------------
United States | | 330 | | 94 | | Direct & Indirect

Symptomatic:
 
Each year approximately 225,500 people are diagnosed with lung cancer and approximately 90 percent of lung cancer patients are symptomatic at presentation (ACS, 2022).
 
Lung Cancer Screening:
 
Given the size of the US market and the progression of CT scan use in early detection, clearance and acceptance of the IONIQ ProLung Test in the US is the major priority. The CDC estimates that there are 94 million Americans at risk of lung cancer (which includes current and former smokers). In the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial of 53,454 patients, approximately 24% of the CT scans performed were positive revealing a lung nodule suspicious for lung cancer that required follow-up. CT screening was recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force on December 31, 2013, and Medicare began to pay for lung cancer screening on February 5, 2016. Based on these estimates, if the approximately 94 million Americans at risk for lung cancer received a low dose CT screen approximately 24% (or 23 million) Americans may reveal lung nodules requiring follow up. We believe these patients would be eligible to receive the IONIQ ProLung Test.

European Market
 
IONIQ Sciences plans to pursue a CE mark in conjunction with US marketing clearance in the European Union and European Free Trade Association Countries, which represents approximately 513 million individuals and 28-member states. Europe has some of the highest smoking prevalence of any region in the world which has led to a high incidence of lung cancer. In 2012, the World Health Organization estimated that 268,000 individuals died from lung cancer and that more than 313,000 cases were diagnosed in the European Union.
 
It is estimated that 28% of Europeans smoke and approximately 133 million individuals are at high-risk of lung cancer. Applying the US rates in the published National Lung Screening Trial (2011), over 30 million of these individuals are estimated to have an indeterminate lung nodule and require follow-up to determine the risk of malignancy. As the number of individuals with indeterminate lung nodules continues to increase in Europe, risk stratification tools such as the IONIQ ProLung Test are needed to close the gap between discovery of a nodule and the determination of malignancy.
 
China Market
 
IONIQ Sciences plans to enter the China market through its licensee (ProLung China). According to the World Health Organization, the number of smokers in China is steadily growing and increasing at higher rates than any other world region. One in three of the world’s cigarettes is smoked in China. The average Chinese smoker consumes 22 cigarettes per day. This is nearly a 50% increase from 1980. Overall, more cigarettes are smoked in China than in the next top 29 cigarette-consuming countries combined. Lung cancer is epidemic in China with 653,000 cases in 2012 and an estimated 597,000 deaths.
 
The government’s smoking cessation campaign and interventions are poorly funded and weakly enforced, and certain provincial governments are somewhat dependent upon state-owned tobacco sales and taxation. However, China’s Government is collaborating with pulmonology and radiology leadership to study low-dose CT screening for earlier detection of lung cancer. The government has also sponsored economic studies to investigate the reimbursement of lung cancer screening in the health insurance system.
 
As the number of individuals with indeterminate lung nodules continues to increase in China, risk stratification tools, such as the IONIQ ProLung Test will be needed to close the gap between discovery of a nodule and the determination of malignancy. This clinical need for risk stratification may be multiplied if a lung cancer screening program is implemented in the Chinese healthcare system.
 
Competition
 
The development and commercialization of new products to improve the accuracy and efficiency of risk stratification of lung cancer is competitive, and we expect considerable competition from major medical device companies, laboratory biomarker tests, and academic institutions that are conducting research in lung cancer. Extensive research and financial resources have been invested in the discovery and development of new lung cancer detection tests. Potential competing technologies include, but are not limited to, breath markers, sputum cytology, DNA-related markers, blood markers, radiography and CT imaging.
 
The timing of market introduction of some of our potential products or of competitors’ products may be an important competitive factor. We believe the speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical trials and clearance processes, and supply commercial quantities to market are important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors including product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, reimbursement, and patent position. We believe that our IONIQ ProLung Test is superior or equivalent to existing alternatives in these areas, other than availability (in the US due to lack of FDA clearance) and reimbursement.

Business
 
IONIQ ProLung Test
 
The IONIQ ProLung Test is comprised of the following two components:
 

● | IONIQ System - Each system, which will be sold to the customer, consists of the probe, scanner, tower, monitor, and keyboard which are all medical grade components available for sale in multiple languages. The pricing of the IONIQ System may vary upon the volume of the IONIQ ProLung Test Kits that a customer buys. We refer to the IONIQ System internally as capital equipment or the ‘razor handle’ in the ubiquitous ‘razor/razor blade’ sales analogy. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | IONIQ ProLung Test Kit – IONIQ ProLung Test Kit sales should provide near term and continual cash flow. Each single-use, disposable, IONIQ ProLung Test Kit is sold in a nonsterile envelope that displays a unique identifier code that is required for access to a IONIQ ProLung Test Report, together with all the components necessary to assure precision test performance, patient comfort and hygiene. Each IONIQ ProLung Test Kit includes six diaphoretic electrodes, one probe tip and one moistening sponge. Initially, ProLung plans to sell the IONIQ ProLung Test Kit for approximately $400 each, available in boxes of 10 and 40. We refer to the IONIQ ProLung Test internally as the disposable component or the razor blade in the ubiquitous razor/razor blade sales analogy. 

 
IONIQ Sciences’ novel Electrical Impedance Analytics (EIA) or bioimpedance technology simultaneously considers data from multiple measurement pathways and utilizes a patented predictive analytic algorithm to combine the individual measurements into a weighted average composite score that indicates an increased or decreased risk of malignancy in the individual in which the nodule has been detected. No images are generated by the IONIQ ProLung Test and extensive training is not required to interpret the composite score.
 
If required regulatory clearances are received, the IONIQ ProLung Test will be introduced to the market as a standard predictive analytic test without the need for transmission of a physical sample or specimen. Instead, the IONIQ ProLung Test acquires bioimpedance measurement data by means of a patented probe and disposable diaphoretic electrodes placed on the back and hands. The data containing precision measurements is processed by a patented predictive analytic algorithm and a report is generated that may be used by the physician in addition to other risk factors, such as nodule size, family history, smoking history, and gender to evaluate patients with suspicious lesions identified by CT scan. The IONIQ ProLung Test is non-invasive, rapid and non-radiating. It requires minimal patient preparation and can be completed in about 20 minutes.
 
The IONIQ ProLung Test Procedure
 

1. | IONIQ ProLung Test System is connected to the probe, to the electrode cables, and to the power supply. Following a brief power-on sequence, the IONIQ ProLung Test completes a self-diagnostic test. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The patient is seated. 
3. | IONIQ ProLung Test kit is opened and removed from its tamper-proof packaging. 
4. | Single-use diaphoretic electrodes are placed at sites on the patient’s back and arms. 
5. | Session data is entered including technician name, physician name, report delivery method and patient data. 
6. | Testing begins, as prompted by the device, by applying the probe to acquire measurement data from sites on the chest, shoulders and arms. 
7. | IONIQ System monitors the acquisition of real-time data. Should re-measurement be required, the device provides visual and audible notification that it has not received usable data. 

Research and Clinical Trial Results
 
Our IONIQ ProLung Test has been evaluated in seven clinical trials at 25 clinical sites with 1,400 subjects. We made modifications to the IONIQ ProLung Test throughout the research process and will continue to attempt to improve its performance. A description of each clinical trial is below:

Proof of Principle — McHenry, IL (2005)
 

● | Description. A blinded single-site study of 36 subjects was designed to detect differences in bioelectrical impedance measurements between biopsy-confirmed lung cancer subjects and age- and gender-matched control subjects. The trial was configured as a sequential design consisting of three individual cohorts. Following the completion of each cohort, the data was evaluated for the presence of a predictive model which would discriminate between the lung cancer patients and control subjects. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Results. The First Cohort of 12 subjects could not be utilized for statistical analysis because of an incorrectly calibrated device. An algorithm or predictive model was derived in the Second Cohort of 14 patients which fully discriminated between lung cancer patients and healthy volunteers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Subsequent analysis of the Third Cohort offered potentially confounding results, but ProLung felt the hypothesis of feasibility of the device had been successfully demonstrated and that sufficient evidence of feasibility existed to proceed with further research. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reliability and Repeatability — Salt Lake City, UT (2006)
 

● | Description. A single-site study to evaluate the variability of the IONIQ ProLung Test in 22 healthy volunteers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Results. Measurement variables evaluated were the maximum and minimum conductance. The maximum and minimum conductance values obtained from one operator making repeated measurements with the same device on volunteer subjects over two days of testing were comparable, with slightly lower standard deviations for maximum conductance readings and extremely high reliability indices for both measures. For both data sets, the same measurement points were found to have minimal variability (and maximal reliability) indices. The Electro Pulmonary Nodule Scan showed a reliability index of 0.99 and a correlation between device replicates of 0.98.

Algorithm Development Study a.k.a. FML-204 — Baltimore, MD (2012)
 

● | Description. This single arm, single site algorithm finding and internal validation trial was designed to derive an algorithm for lung cancer detection in subjects with suspicious lung nodules. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Results. Final results included the identification of an algorithm capable of 90% sensitivity (correctly identifying 26 of 29 malignant masses), 92% specificity (correctly identifying 11 of 12 non-malignant masses), and Receiver Operating Characteristic (“ROC”) area (combined sensitivity and specificity) of 90% (correctly identifying 37 of 41 patients overall). Final results were presented in 2011 at the World Conference of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and at the Annual Congress of the European Respiratory Society and were published in the April 2012 edition of the Journal of Thoracic Oncology. 
 | Though not part of the original study, a subsequent subset analysis was performed on Study subjects who had indeterminate results on FDG-PET scans (n=7). In this subset (3 benign, 4 malignant) the IONIQ ProLung Test correctly predicted the risk of malignancy in the index nodule being assessed. These results were presented at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer World Congress in Denver, CO, in September 2015 and published in volume 10, number 9, Supplement 2, Journal of Thoracic Oncology, p. S305). 

Repeatability a.k.a. PL-209 — Salt Lake City, Utah (2015)
 

● | Description. The repeatability study enrolled sixty subjects, 30 male and 30 female, half of each gender with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more, and half with a BMI of 28 or less. Each subject was scanned twice on Day One and twice on Day Two. All scans were done by the same operator on the same IONIQ System. Fifty-nine subjects produced evaluable data. Four models (algorithms) were tested. The study was conducted by ProLung. Study objectives included quantifying the effects of gender, body mass index (BMI), day-to-day subject variability and variability of a single device when volume-averaged thoracic bioconductance was measured with the IONIQ ProLung Test.

● | Final Results. (1) Same-day variability is statistically significant (average second score is 0.0214 points lower), but the clinical impact of this finding is unclear (2) Day-to-day variability is impacted by the model (algorithm) chosen. One particular model with age (model 1b+age) has an ICC=0.958, indicating it is very repeatable. (3) Gender and BMI do not affect test performance. (4) Average test time is 18.5 minutes, with a range of 15-24 minutes. (5) The test is well tolerated and agreeable to test subjects. The repeatability study addressed several questions regarding use of the IONIQ ProLung Test. One significant limitation of this study is that no subjects with known pulmonary nodules or malignancy were enrolled. It is unknown whether pulmonary nodules or malignancy affect the repeatability of the IONIQ ProLung Test. While the study showed statistically significant variability of approximately 2% when testing the same subject twice on the same day, the clinical impact of this finding is unknown because it is not anticipated that patients will receive a second test on the same day in clinical use. While we note significant day-to-day variability when using an earlier model (the algorithm used in the Johns Hopkins Study, Journal of Thoracic Oncology, 2012), repeatability is markedly improved when using a more refined model.

PL-208 Study – (2012-2019)
 

● | Description. Three Validation studies have been completed for the IONIQ ProLung Test. The first is PL-208 which enrolled 420 patients across 15 US centers (ID: NCT01566682). This study was two-phased, with a 200-patient open-labelled training set to test and optimize an algorithm, followed by testing of the optimized algorithm on the diagnosis-blinded 174-patient validation set. Forty-six (46) subjects (11%) were excluded for being lost to follow up or having an inconclusive diagnosis, missing or inadequate device data. The predictive algorithm utilized the patient’s bioconductance measurements coupled with the patient’s age and a binary cut-off point of 0.5 was chosen to distinguish between high and low likelihood of cancer. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Final Results. The algorithm was locked and applied to a blinded validation set of 174 patients and yielded a Sensitivity of 69% Specificity of 49%, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 70%, Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 47% and overall Accuracy of 61%. 

PLW-208 Study – (2015-2016) 
 

● | Description. The second validation trial (PLW-208) was completed by the Company’s licensor (ProLung Wuxi). This study enrolled 138 subjects at 2 centers in China. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Final Results. This study was similar in design to the US PL-208 Study and obtained a Sensitivity of 77%, Specificity of 60%, PPV of 82%, NPV of 41% and an Accuracy of 73%. In reviewing this study, the Sponsor determined that test method and operator training needed to be improved to obtain better results. 

PLW-216 Study – (2017-2019)
 

● | Description. Ultimately, the Study Sponsor (ProLung Wuxi) improved the device operator training, test method and device predictive algorithm. The Sponsor concluded the PLW-208 Study and initiated PLW-216, utilizing improved training, test method and a modified locked predictive algorithm. This PLW-216 Study was a single-phase validation study whereby the predictive algorithm was locked prior to the first patient being enrolled and the IONIQ ProLung Test results were provided to site investigators prior to knowing the subject’s actual diagnosis. The PLW-216 Study enrolled 486 subjects in China at 4 centers led by Dr. Bai, the Chair of the Chinese Alliance against lung Cancer and Director of the Shanghai Respiratory Research Institute (ID: NCT 02726633, registration No 20170226). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Final Results. The Validation Study demonstrated improved performance yielding a Sensitivity of 84% Specificity of 73%, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 78%, Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 80% and overall Accuracy of 79% from the US Study PL-208 (ID NCT0156668). This performance is comparable to other diagnostic cancer devices such as Mammogram (~sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 71%) and was demonstrated in a large sample size of 418 subjects included in the final analysis.

Other Research
 
PL-210 - ProLung Test Measurement Collection Protocols for Label Expansion (Ongoing NCT04134520)
 
The purpose of this Study is to identify and test different data collection methods to determine which approaches may be useful in evaluation additional cancers to lung cancer (including breast cancer) and improve the ProLung Testing procedure. Once this Study is complete, the Sponsor plans to evaluate these improvements in future follow up cancer validation studies that will assess device accuracy using the new measurement collection methods. Preliminary results showing the feasibility of the IONIQ technology to detect breast cancer have been published in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Journal (IEEE) in November of 2021.
 
Mexico. In 2011, ProLung supported a study with a hospital located in Mexico City. The study was administered by ProLung’s partner who was pursuing a joint venture license for the Mexico territory. The partner eventually abandoned the study. After receiving preliminary test results, ProLung had reason to question the quality of the data being gathered and withdrew its support of the study.
 
China. We issued a license to an entity conducting research in China in 2013. Their 486 patient Validation Study (PLW-216) using the ProLung technology was completed in 2019. In August 2019, ProLung announced that it amended the ProLung China license. The third addendum supports an expanded full collaboration business relationship wherein Prolung China Co. (“Prolung China”) and subsidiary (ProLung Biotech Wuxi) agree to provide all ProLung Biotech Wuxi Know-How and Improvements and clinical data which are used in Clinical Trials in China (PLW-208 and PLW-216) to ProLung, and other matters.
 
Italy and Switzerland. Four centers in Italy and one center in Switzerland conducted research with the IONIQ ProLung Test under the direction of local clinicians. Subject enrollment at these sites did not conform to research protocols utilized by ProLung. In addition, this prior research did not include IONIQ’s current measurement method and algorithm improvements. The results of these studies were presented in the World Congress of Thoracic Imaging and American Thoracic Society conferences.
 
At two other sites, Geneva and Florence, additional physician-sponsored research was conducted. It is not known whether these sites conducted research with the IONIQ ProLung Test that was compliant with Good Clinical Practice or whether these patients conformed with the IONIQ ProLung Test patient selection criteria. However, in June 2017, at the World Congress of Thoracic Imaging the Geneva site posted results indicating Test sensitivity of 66% and a specificity of 66%. The positive predictive value was 94% and negative predictive value was 20%. Geneva researchers concluded the IONIQ ProLung Test could lower the need for invasive biopsies, especially in high-risk patients. The small number of patients (n=27) precludes definitive conclusions.
 
Similarly, at a center in Florence, Italy, a study looked at 22 subjects undergoing the IONIQ ProLung Test and PET CT scans. They reported a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 50%, with a positive predictive value of 94% and a negative predictive value of 17%. Researchers concluded that the high positive predictive value of the IONIQ ProLung Test suggested utility in the evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules, adding that further research was warranted. This was presented in the form of a poster at the 2017 American Thoracic Society (ATS) Conference.

Governmental Regulations
 
Our business is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety. Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of subjective interpretations. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change, or new laws may be enacted.
 
Both federal and state governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers to comply with all applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations most relevant to our business.
 
US Food and Drug Administration regulation of medical devices.
 
The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and FDA regulations establish a comprehensive system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. Our products include medical devices that are subject to these, as well as other federal, state, local and foreign, laws and regulations. The FDA is responsible for enforcing most of the federal laws and regulations governing medical devices in the United States.
 
The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes - Class I, Class II, or Class III depending on their level of risk and the types of controls that are necessary to ensure device safety and effectiveness. The class assignment is a factor in determining the type of premarket submission or application, if any, that will be required before marketing in the United States. We currently anticipate that the IONIQ System will be classified as a Class II de novo medical device.
 

12
--


● | Class I devices present a low risk and are not life-sustaining or life-supporting. The majority of Class I devices are subject only to “general controls” -e.g., prohibition against adulteration and misbranding, registration and listing, good manufacturing practices, labeling, and adverse event reporting. General controls are baseline requirements that apply to all three classes of medical devices. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Class II devices present a moderate risk and are devices for which general controls alone are not sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices in Class II are subject to both general controls and “special controls” -e.g., special labeling, compliance with industry standards, and post market surveillance. Unless exempted, Class II devices typically require FDA clearance before marketing, through the premarket notification (“510(k)”) process. 
● | The de novo application process provides a pathway to Class I or II classification for medical devices for which general controls or general and special controls provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, but for which there is no legally marketed predicate device. 
● | Class III devices present the highest risk. These devices generally are life-sustaining, life-supporting, for a use that is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury, or are not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. Class III devices are devices for which general controls, by themselves, are insufficient and for which there is insufficient information to establish special controls to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class III devices are subject to general controls and typically require FDA clearance of a premarket approval (“PMA”) application before marketing. 

 
Unless it is exempt from premarket review requirements, a medical device must receive marketing authorization from the FDA prior to being commercially marketed, distributed or sold in the United States. The most common pathways for obtaining marketing authorization are 510(k) clearance and PMA.
 
510(k) pathway
 
The 510(k)-review process compares a new device to a legally marketed device. Through the 510(k) process, the FDA determines whether a new medical device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed device (i.e., predicate device) that is not subject to PMA requirements. “Substantial equivalence” means that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and either the same or similar technological characteristics as the predicate device, or if there are differences in technological characteristics, the differences do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate, and the information submitted in the 510(k) demonstrates that the proposed device is as safe and effective as the predicate device.
 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a 510(k)-application containing sufficient information and data to demonstrate that its proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. These data generally include non-clinical performance testing (e.g., software validation, animal testing, electrical safety testing), but clinical data may also be required. Typically, it takes six to twelve months for the FDA to complete its review of a 510(k) submission; however, it can take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. During its review of a 510(k), the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After completing its review of a 510(k), the FDA may issue an order, in the form of a letter, that finds the device to be either (1) substantially equivalent and states that the device can be marketed in the United States, or (2) not substantially equivalent and states that device cannot be marketed in the United States. Depending upon the reason(s) for the not substantially equivalent finding, the device may need to be approved through the PMA pathway (discussed below) prior to commercialization.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, including significant modifications to any products or procedures, requires a new submission and clearance of a new 510(k). The FDA relies on each manufacturer to make and document its determination that a new 510(k) is (or is not) required, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If we are granted an initial 510(k), we may make minor product enhancements that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearance. If the FDA disagrees with our determination regarding whether a new 510(k) clearance was required for these modifications, we may need to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device. The FDA may also subject us to other enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, issuing a warning letter or untitled letter to us, seizing our products, imposing civil penalties, or initiating criminal prosecution.

De novo pathway
 
If, at the end of the FDA review of a 510(k), the FDA determines that a device is “Not Substantially Equivalent” (“NSE”) due to the unavailability of a predicate device, a new intended use or different technological characteristics that raise different questions of safety and effectiveness, the FDA may indicate that the device may be suitable for review under the de novo classification process. If the FDA believes general controls or general and special controls may provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA may indicate in the NSE letter that the product may be appropriate for the de novo classification process under section 513(f)(2) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”). Inclusion of this language within an NSE letter does not indicate that sufficient information currently exists to support a successful de novo request, but simply indicates that given the risk profile of the device, it seems reasonable that de novo classification may be appropriate.
 
Alternatively, if a manufacturer believes their device is appropriate for classification into Class I or Class II and has determined, based on currently available information, there is no legally marketed predicate device, they may submit a de novo request without a preceding 510(k) and NSE.
 
Once a de novo request is received (regardless of whether it is preceded by a 510(k) and NSE determination), the FDA will also check that the content of the de novo request includes the information required by section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. De novo requests that lack information to determine whether a potential predicate device exists may be placed on hold. If the de novo request is missing information and/or data necessary to determine whether general controls or general and special controls can provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA may issue an additional information (AI) letter or request information via interactive review. If the de novo requestor fails to provide a complete response within 180 calendar days of the date of the AI request, the FDA will consider the de novo request to be withdrawn. If a de novo request is withdrawn due to failure to submit adequate information, a new de novo request is required in order to reinitiate review of the device under the de novo classification process.
 
If the data and information submitted demonstrate that general controls or general and special controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the FDA will grant the de novo request. If a de novo request is granted, the FDA will issue you a written order granting the de novo request and identifying the classification of the device (either class I or class II). For class II devices, the FDA will also identify the applicable special controls. Effective on the date of the granting order, the requester may immediately begin marketing the device subject to the general controls and any identified special controls. The device may be used as a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions as appropriate.
 
Premarket approval pathway
 
Unlike the comparative standard of the 510(k) pathway, the PMA approval process requires an independent demonstration of the safety and effectiveness of a device. PMA is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by the FDA. PMA approval is based on a determination by the FDA that the PMA contains sufficient valid scientific evidence to ensure that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). A PMA application generally includes extensive information about the device including the results of clinical testing conducted on the device and a detailed description of the manufacturing process.
 
After a PMA application is accepted for review, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. FDA regulations provide 180 days to review the PMA and make a determination; however, the review time is normally longer (e.g., 1-3 years). During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the data supporting the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to whether the data provide a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a preapproval inspection of the applicant’s establishment to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of finished devices.
 

14
--

 

Based on its review, the FDA may (1) issue an order approving the PMA, (2) issue a letter stating the PMA is “approvable” (e.g., minor additional information is needed), (3) issue a letter stating the PMA is “not approvable,” or (4) issue an order denying PMA. A company may not market a device subject to PMA review until the FDA issues an order approving the PMA. As part of a PMA approval (or 510(k) clearance), the FDA may impose post-approval conditions intended to ensure the continued safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and requiring the collection of additional clinical data. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval (or clearance) can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval (or clearance).
 
Most modifications to a PMA approved device, including changes to the design, labeling, or manufacturing process, require prior approval before being implemented. Prior approval is obtained through submission of a PMA supplement. The type of information required to support a PMA supplement and the FDA’s time for review of a PMA supplement vary depending on the nature of the modification.
 
Clinical trials
 
FDA generally prohibits the shipping and marketing of medical devices in the absence of a premarket clearance or approval (where required). However, the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) regulation exempts the provision of devices for use in certain types of clinical trials – i.e., clinical trials to collect safety and effectiveness data for investigational devices, and clinical trials evaluating new intended uses and/or certain modifications to a legally marketed device – from this prohibition. This regulation places significant responsibility on the sponsor of the clinical study including, but not limited to, choosing qualified investigators, monitoring the trial, submitting required reports, maintaining required records, and assuring investigators obtain informed consent, comply with the study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, submit required reports, etc.
 
Clinical trials of significant risk devices (e.g., implants, devices used in supporting or sustaining human life, devices of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or that otherwise present a serious risk to the health, safety, and welfare of a subject) require FDA and Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval prior to starting the trial. FDA approval is requested through submission of an IDE application. Clinical trials of non-significant risk (“NSR”), devices (i.e. devices that do not meet the regulatory definition of a significant risk device) do not require FDA approval but do require IRB approval before starting. The clinical trial sponsor is responsible for making the initial determination of whether a clinical study is significant risk or NSR; however, a reviewing IRB and/or FDA may review this decision and disagree with the determination.
 
An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as nonclinical performance data, animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the clinical study protocol is scientifically sound. There is no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials. Additionally, after a trial begins, the FDA may place a clinical trial on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
As noted above, the FDA may require a company to collect clinical data on a device in the post market setting.
 
The collection of such data may be required as a condition of PMA approval. The FDA also has the authority to order, via a letter, a post market surveillance study for certain devices at any time after they have been cleared or approved.
 
Pervasive and continuing FDA regulation
 
After a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or premarket pathway, numerous additional FDA requirements generally apply. These include, but are not limited to:
 

● | Establishment registration and device listing requirements; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | QSR, which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of finished devices; 


15
--


● | Labeling requirements, which mandate the inclusion of certain content in device labels and labeling, and when fully implemented, will generally require the label and package of medical devices to include a unique device identifier (“UDI”), and which also prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, i.e., “off-label,” uses; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”), regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and 
● | Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation, which requires that manufacturers and importers report to the FDA recalls (i.e., corrections or removals) if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; manufacturers and importers must keep records of recalls that they determine to be not reportable. The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include, but is not limited to, the following sanctions: 


● | Notice of inspectional observations; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Untitled letters or warning letters; 
● | Fines, injunctions and civil penalties; 
● | Recall or seizure of our products; 
● | Operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | Refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products; 
● | Withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and 
● | Criminal prosecution. 

 
We are subject to unannounced device inspections by the FDA, as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation of and compliance with applicable state public health regulations. These inspections may include our suppliers’ facilities.
 
Marketing Approvals Outside the United States
 
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ.
Europe
 
Under the European Union Medical Device Regulation, or EU MDR, medical devices must meet the EU MDR requirements and receive a CE marking certification prior to marketing in the European Union, or EU. CE marking is the uniform labeling system of products designed to facilitate the supervision and control of the EU concerning manufacturers’ compliance with the various regulations and directives of the EU and to clarify the obligations imposed in the various legislative provisions in the EU. Use of a uniform product labeling indicates compliance with all the directives and regulations required for the application of such labeling, and it is effective as a manufacturer’s declaration that the product meets the required criteria and technical specifications of the relevant authorities such as health, safety, and environmental protection. CE marking ensures free trade between the EU and European Free Trade Association countries (Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) and permits the enforcement and customs authorities in European countries not to allow the marketing of similar products that do not bear the CE marking sign. Such certification allows, among other things, marking the products (according to various categories) with the CE marking and their sale and marketing in the EU.

16
--

 

CE marking certification requires a comprehensive quality system program, comprehensive technical documentation and data on the product, which are then reviewed by a Notified Body, or NB. An NB is an organization designated by the national governments of the EU member states to make independent judgments about whether a product complies with the EU MDR requirements and to grant the CE marking if we, and our product, comply with specified terms. After receiving the CE marking, we must pass a review carried out by the competent NB annually, under which it audits our facilities to verify our compliance with the ISO 13485 quality system standard.
 
Compliance with the ISO 13485 standard, for medical device quality management systems, is required for regulatory purposes. ISO standards are recognized international quality standards that are designed to ensure that we develop and manufacture quality medical devices. Other countries are also instituting regulations regarding medical devices. Compliance with these regulations requires extensive documentation and clinical reports for all our product candidates, revisions to labeling, and other requirements such as facility inspections to comply with the registration requirements.
 
China
 
China’s medical device market, currently in a rapid state of expansion, is overseen by the National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA (formerly the China Food and Drug Administration). The NMPA issues registration certificates required for all medical devices sold in China. The NMPA uses a risk-based system, and its approval process requires mandatory testing for Class II and III devices. Class II devices are moderate-risk devices and Class III devices are high-risk medical devices. Third-party review of devices is currently not allowed in China; only the NMPA is authorized to approve devices. The registration process requires the submission of a registration standard along with device samples for testing. Manufacturers of Class II and Class III medical devices are also required to demonstrate that the device has been approved by the country of origin with documents like a CE certificate, 510(k) letter and PMA approval and compliance with ISO 13485, and they may also be required to submit clinical data in support of their application. In addition to these requirements, all medical device manufacturers must also include product information in Chinese on all packaging and labeling. Manufacturers exporting medical devices to China must appoint several China-based agents to act on their behalf. These include a registration agent to coordinate the NMPA registration process, a legal agent to handle any adverse events reported with a registered device, including a product recall, and an after-sales agent to provide technical service and maintenance support.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the CMS, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. These regulations include:

● | the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for referring an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a Federal health care program, or in return for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service or item, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law or related to off-label promotion constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal false claims laws; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 fraud and abuse provisions, which prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, or making false statements or concealing a material fact relating to payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services;

● | the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Post-Marketing Regulations
 
Following approval of a new product, a company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting for uses or in patient populations not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process.
 
Other Regulatory Matters
 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. Sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
The distribution of medical device products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of medical device products.

Our Marketing Process
 
We must receive separate regulatory approvals from the FDA and equivalent regulatory bodies in other countries for each of the devices before we can sell them commercially in the US or internationally. We cannot make the claims necessary to market any of our product candidates until we have completed the requirements for regulatory authorization. We do not know whether regulatory authorities will grant authorization for any of the products that we, our marketing partners, or distribution partners will develop.
 
A summary of the status of our marketing authorizations in the key initial markets we have identified is set forth below:
 

● | United States. The first planned product utilizing our proprietary digital platform, the IONIQ ProLung Test™ for lung cancer, has been designated a Breakthrough Device by the U.S. FDA in February 2020. We submitted our de novo application to the U.S. FDA in February 2022 and we received a substantive review from the FDA outlining additional information that is required for US regulatory clearance. These items include questions and requests related to biocompatibility testing, clinical data, Indications for Use and labeling, cybersecurity documentation, electrical safety, special controls, human factors and usability, performance testing, risk analysis, software, sterility and shelf life. We remain fully committed to gaining U.S. FDA regulatory de novo clearance and continue to collaborate with the US FDA so that we can satisfy their requests and subsequently commercialize the IONIQ ProLung Test for lung cancer. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | China. The NMPA (previously known as the SFDA) roughly follows the FDA model and is the source of clearance for the marketing and sale of medical devices in China. To be sold in China, medical devices must be registered with Chinese health authorities. In February 2014, the Company’s licensor in China received clearance to manufacture the device from the Beijing government. Additional clearances are required to market and sell the device in this market. 

 
After each respective regulatory clearance is obtained, the next step in each of these markets is for insurance companies or government agencies, as applicable, to agree to reimburse providers for the IONIQ ProLung Test. We have not commenced this process in the US or any other market, as we do not yet have marketing authorizations.
 
Manufacturing Requirements
 
As a manufacturer of medical devices, we must comply with the 21 CFR Part 820 Good Manufacturing Practice regulations established by the FDA. These requirements are meant to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective. We maintain a quality management system that includes standard operating procedures for key processes such as design, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, servicing, record keeping, complaint handling and corrective and preventative action. Our quality management system is currently ISO 13485 certified and is intended to meet the 21 CFR Part 820 Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. We will also be subject to similar requirements imposed by other countries.
Manufacturing
 
We currently manufacture the IONIQ ProLung Test and the IONIQ ProLung Test Kit. When volume requirements exceed current manufacturing capacity, we intend to utilize contract manufacturers for the physical manufacturing of our products. This may afford us numerous benefits, including:

● | the ability to ramp up production quickly; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | access to leading technologies, supply chain networks and best-in-class manufacturing processes for its products; 
● | flexibility to use one or many manufacturers in many regions of the world to optimize costs, production volumes, material availability, lead times, and to meet various regional regulations. 

 
Our prospective contract manufacturers will source our product components from multiple specialized vendors that supply plastics, sheet metal, machining, cables, wire harnesses, and other computer hardware components. We maintain our own design control and ISO 13485 quality system.
