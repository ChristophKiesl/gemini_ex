Overview
 
We develop products and operate platforms to provide a real money online gambling experience focused on esports and competitive gaming. We operate licensed online gambling platforms which are real money betting platforms. Our mission is to define, shape and drive growth of the current and future esports wagering ecosystem by providing advanced product, platform and marketing solutions directly to service providers and customers. We accept wagers on major esports titles including: Counter-Strike: GO, League of Legends, Dota 2, StarCraft 2, Rocket League, Rainbow Six, Warcraft 3, King of Glory and FIFA; as well as professional sports including the National Football League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, soccer and more.
 
On November 29, 2021, we acquired the Business to Consumer (B2C) business of Aspire Global plc (“Aspire”). The B2C business offers a portfolio of distinctive proprietary brands focused primarily on igaming, which is online casino and table games such as blackjack, virtual sport computer simulated games and slot machines, as well as traditional sports betting, in the locations where we are licensed to do so, to a diverse customer base operating across regulated markets. (See additional information on the acquisition of the Aspire B2C business below)
 
Esports is the competitive playing of video games by amateur and professional individuals and teams for cash prizes. Esports typically take the form of organized, multiplayer video games that include real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter, and multiplayer online battle arena games. Esports also includes games which can be played, primarily by amateurs, in multiplayer competitions on the Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox and WII Nintendo systems.
 
Although official competitions have long been a part of video game culture, participation and spectatorship of such events have seen a global surge in popularity over the past few years with the growth of online streaming and has been further accelerated by the cancelation of traditional sporting events worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As these esports matches are widely broadcasted and watched predominately online, live betting and wagering can occur on these matches, where it is legal and regulated.
 
Acquisition of Aspire Global Plc’s (“Aspire”) Business to Consumer (“B2C”) Business
 
In order to accelerate the growth and expand market access for our esports product offerings, on November 29, 2021, we acquired Aspire’s B2C Business, for €65,000,000 payable as follows: (i) a cash amount of €50,000,000; (ii) €10,000,000, payable in accordance with the terms of an unsecured subordinated promissory note; and (iii) 186,838 shares of our common stock, which were valued at €5,000,000.
 
This acquisition expands our product offerings and increases the number of markets in which we can operate. The B2C business offers a portfolio of distinctive proprietary brands to a diverse customer base operating across regulated markets. The B2C segment generated revenues of €69.3 million in the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021.
 
The acquisition of Aspire’s B2C business provides the following strategic benefits:
 

· | ownership of Aspire’s portfolio of B2C proprietary online casino and sportsbook brands consisting of Karamba, Hopa, Griffon Casino, BetTarget, Dansk777, and GenerationVIP;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | market access for our esports products in key regulated markets including the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, Malta, and Denmark, among others, allowing us to cross-sell esports wagering opportunities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | During 2022, we intend to launch additional esports focused online gaming websites that target these additional markets; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | enhanced strategic partnership with Aspire who will provide the on-line gaming platform and a managed services offering, including customer service, customer on-boarding and payment processing ensuring operational stability and continuity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our gaming license from the Curacao Gaming Authority and the licenses made available to us from the Acquisition of the Aspire B2C business allows us to accept esports and sports wagers from residents of more than 160 jurisdictions.

Market for Esports Gambling
 
The advent of online streaming has turned esports into a global industry that includes professional players and teams competing in major events that are simultaneously watched in-person in stadiums and by online viewers, which regularly exceed 1 million viewers for major tournaments. The impact of online streaming on the gaming industry has been so significant that video game developers are now building features into their games designed to facilitate competition. Most major professional esports events and a wide range of amateur esports events are broadcast live via streaming services including twitch.tv and youtube.com. This, in turn, has led to increases in wagering on these events.
 
According to Newzoo, a gaming industry source for games market insights and analytics, the global video game market is forecast to be worth $159 billion in 2020. Esports revenue for 2020 is projected to be $1.488 billion (not including gambling) according to Green Man Gaming. According to H2 Gambling Capital and iGaming Business, the net revenue from regulated esports-specific betting will grow by 39% year-on-year in 2020, to reach $343 million, and by 2024, the market is projected to generate $862 million in revenue. We are not currently expecting any meaningful revenue generation from the wider video game market or esports revenue opportunities, such as sponsorships, advertising, event and ticket sales or merchandise sales.
 
As the size of the market and the number of esports enthusiasts continues to grow, we anticipate the number of esports enthusiasts who gamble will grow concurrently which we believe may increase demand for our platform. Additionally, given the recent cancelations of sporting events and the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, along with the unknown timing of when life and business will return to normal, we believe a business opportunity exists to provide these opportunities to existing and new wagering customers as alternatives to live sporting events.
 
Our Products and Services
 
We currently operate online wagering websites where we take deposits and funds from our customers and offer our customers the ability to use those funds to wager on a wide range of events, focused on the outcome of esports competitive video game competitions. Although we focus on esports, we also offer iGaming, which is online casino and table games such as blackjack, virtual sport computer simulated games and slot machines, as well as traditional sports betting.


In 2021, we launched our “free to play” online esports experience. Our “free to play” experience allows users to predict esports match winners and outcomes without wagering real money. We offer users ways to earn points on our site for loyalty and continued engagement. We anticipate monetizing the traffic via advertising (both display and affiliate).

Our Technology and Product Development
 
In order to create the best real-money esports product offerings, we have invested in new esports predictive gaming models. Our proprietary technology has been developed to provide the best real money betting odds for the esports betting customer that will also increase the number of betting options for our esports customers. We are also developing a Google Chrome browser extension allowing increased in-play bets and cash-out options. We will continue to invest in these technologies and continue to purchase third-party intellectual property that will allow us to offer our users an expanded range of overall betting markets, more numerous esports cash-out offerings, and expanded live-betting options. Once live, these technologies will allow us to bring new innovative experiences to market. We believe these investments in proprietary intellectual property, combined with purchased or licensed third-party intellectual property, will allow us to offer our customers:

· | increased betting opportunities across additional esports games;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------
· | better pricing for placing wagers; and 
· | expanded esports cash-out and live-betting offerings. 

 
We expect to launch these products beginning in calendar first quarter of 2022.
 
Our Intellectual Property and License Agreements
 
Our long-term strategy is to differentiate ourselves in the esports gaming industry by developing our own intellectual property in the form of new esports predictive gaming models, predictive consolidated data feeds, bet matching engines, and the platform and software services that allow distribution to both customers and business partners.
 
In connection with our strategy, we have filed patent applications for various intellectual property including
 
Live Streaming Wagering Technology - On June 23, 2021, we filed a patent application for our technology that enhances the betting experience for sports and esports live streaming events that integrates sports and esports wagering across many of the world’s most popular live streaming platforms, including Twitch, YouTube, Amazon TV & Gaming, Facebook Gaming, and Hulu among others.
Artificial Intelligence-Powered Real-Time Odds Modeling & Simulation System – On August 19, 2021, we filed a patent application for our technology that uses artificial intelligence to generate odds models for use in a betting algorithm for esports tournaments and various stages of a tournament to generate odds instantly for any number of esports match.
Electronic Sports Betting Exchange System – On November 2, 2021, we filed a patent application for our technology for a private betting exchange model that is configured to offer operators and high-volume bettors greater liquidity and improved pricing in an esports betting environment where large bet sizes do not impact market prices.
Esports Wagering Modeling System and Method in Multiplayer Games – On November 9, 2021, we filed a new patent application for a system that uses a modified statistical distribution for modeling possible outcomes in battle games involving multiple players and teams. The systems and methods described in Esports Technologies’ patent application detail the use of this statistical tool to represent the exact score distribution of kills in multiplayer online battle events.

We also license software from third parties which we believe will give us competitive advantages and create valuable and new experiences for customers during their wagering experience. We have an exclusive software licensing agreement, except with respect to the licensor and one entity, Hillside (Technology) Limited, for the use, distribution, and resale of multiple cash-out patents as well as a lottery and jackpot software platform in the field of esports with Colossus Bets (LTD), a London-based company that is licensed and regulated in Great Britain. Pursuant to the license, we will share equally in any and all revenue payable to us during the term of the license from the licensing by us of the licensed patents to any third parties. The license will enable us to exclusively provide Colossus Jackpot functionality for esports. The esports Jackpot product allows us to offer a user the chance to win multi-million-dollar prize pools for a low entry cost, much like a lottery ticket. The agreement also stipulates the exclusive usage and distribution rights for the cash-out patents in the portfolio. The license has a three-year term, provided that Colossus Bets (LTD) may terminate the license after two years if it has not generated at least GBP £500,000 in revenue during that two-year period, provided that we have the option to extend the license for one year upon the payment of an additional fee of GBP £150,000.
 
On September 1, 2020, our wholly owned subsidiary, ESEG Limited, entered into three domain purchase agreements pursuant to which it acquired the following domain names: Esportsbook.com, Browserbets.com, esportsgames.com, Esportstechnologies.com, Browserbet.com, Fantasyduel.com and Esportsgamers.com.
 
Competition
 
We operate in the global entertainment and gaming industries and our customers and there is intense competition among online gaming and entertainment providers. A number of established, well-financed companies producing online gaming products and services compete with our offerings, and other well-capitalized companies may introduce competitive services.
Human Capital Resources
 
As a multinational technology company with approximately 60 employees and contractors located in 8 countries, our business success is driven by our highly skilled workforce. With our global technology and product team, we are focused on delivering new, innovative and exciting products to our growing base of customers.
 
We recognize that engaging and developing our employees is a key to our success and we rely on attracting and retaining our talent to deliver on our mission. During the year we have implemented a new human resources system to better understand employees’ satisfaction through quarterly performance assessments. These assessments ensure we understand how we can better deliver on our investments in technology and meet our customers’ needs.
 
We also offer our employees a competitive compensation package with health and welfare benefits for our employees and family members. In addition, every employee is eligible for equity awards to share in our financial success.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that affect our ability to operate our product offerings. These product offerings are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulations that could change based on political and social norms and that could be interpreted in ways that could negatively impact our business.
 
Our gaming license from the Curacao Gaming Authority and the licenses made available to us from the Acquisition of the Aspire B2C business allows us to accept esports and sports wagers from residents of more than 160 jurisdictions. Our focus is to invest and develop our business in Western Europe, Asia and Latin America. We currently do not have the ability to accept wagers from customers based in the United States.
 
The gaming industry is highly regulated and we must maintain compliance to licenses and pay gaming taxes or a percentage of revenue where required by the jurisdictions in which we operate in order to continue our operations. Our business is subject to compliance with extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, integrity and character of the owners, managers and persons with material financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in that and other jurisdictions.

Data Protection and Privacy
 
Because we handle, collect, store, receive, transmit and otherwise process certain personal information of our users and employees, we are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws related to the privacy and protection of such data.
 
With our operations in Europe, we face particular privacy, data security and data protection risks in connection with requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (EU) 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) and other data protection regulations. Any failure to comply with these rules may result in regulatory fines or penalties including orders that require us to change the way we process data. In the event of a data breach, we are also subject to breach notification laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the GDPR, and the risk of litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.
 
Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, interpretations of laws or regulations, or market practices, regarding the use of personal data, or regarding the manner in which we seek to comply with applicable laws and regulations, could require us to make modifications to our products, services, policies, procedures, notices, and business practices, including potentially material changes. Such changes could potentially have an adverse impact on our business.
 
Curacao License
 
The Curacao Ministry of Justice has only granted four online gaming Master Licenses. Our license is a sublicense from one of the four master license holders, Gaming Services Provider N.V. #365/JAZ. The Curacao Ministry of Justice allows an applicant for a sublicense from a Master License holder to operate under the master license holder’s license, so long as they meet certain operating and compliance criteria, including, without limitation, providing quarterly and annual submissions and conducting “know your customer” procedures. These criteria must be met at the stage of application as well as on an ongoing basis. As such, so long as we maintain the requisite criteria for holding the sublicense, as a sublicensee we can enjoy the same privileges and rights that the Master License holder has, but without the ability to issue licenses.
 
This single sublicense covers any kind of game requiring skill or chance, including esports and sports betting. Additionally, it also allows the operator to carry out and offer services related to iGaming including aggregators, software providers, and platform operators.
 
The entities that evaluate our ongoing compliance are the Master License holder and the Curacao Gaming Control Board. There is no set standard, to date, to quantify sanctions. These are reviewed on an individual basis. The framework to suspend a sublicense is based on the severity of the infraction, and include, not paying licensing fees, not adhering to policies or resolving customer issues, and not keeping required “know your customer” procedures up to date. Where direct violations of the sublicense agreement pertain to the compliance with the Master License, suspensions would be enforced until the sublicense holder has submitted all needed information or documents as requested by the Master License holder or the Curacao Gaming Board. In addition, any customer complaints that are not resolved could result in a suspension of our sublicense depending on the severity of the issue. Finally, marketing or accepting players from prohibited countries could result in an immediate suspension of our sublicense. In such case, we would need to show that IP geo blocking of the countries has been implemented and measures put in place to ensure we are not accepting customers from said country moving forward.
 
Responsible and Safer Gaming
 
We view the safety and welfare of our users as critical to our business and have made appropriate investments in our processes and systems. We are committed to industry-leading responsible gaming practices and seek to provide our users with the resources and services they need to play responsibly.
Legal Proceedings
 
While we are not presently party to any active legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results, from time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.
