In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company sold a 70% Membership Interest in its wholly owned subsidiary (MA & Associates, LLC) in consideration of retirement of approximately $1,000,000 in the Company’s debt and approximately $500,000 in cash (of which $117,894 was funded as of December 31, 2017). The buyer also has an option to buy an additional 10% for 18 months from the closing at a 10% premium to the 70% purchase. The option to purchase the additional 10% has been extended to November 22, 2020 (i.e. three years from the date of the sale of the initial 70% interest). The Company will account for their remaining 30% interest as an equity level investment going forward. On June 30, 2020, the Company sold the remaining 10% equity interest from the November 22, 2017 Membership Interest Agreement in MA & Associates for an aggregate total of $226,388. The total amount was in the form of retirement of the loans extended by the Buyer as designated by Buyer in Buyer’s sole and absolute discretion, including applicable interest, default interest, late charges, and other obligations accrued. The Company still maintains a 20% equity interest in MA & Associates. 
 
Line of Business
 
We currently have a minority interest one line of business relating to and revolving around the cannabis industry; at this time no significant revenue has been derived from this source.

· | Testing Facilities. We entered this arena through our acquisition of a 100% equity stake in MA & Associates, LLC in order to set up two testing locations within the State of Nevada. MA & Associates, LLC was launched in September of 2013 to provide quality control services to the medical cannabis industry. MA & Associates, LLC's primary mission is to protect the public health by providing infrastructure and analytical services to legally authorized distributors and producers of cannabis and to regulators tracking their operations.

MA & Associates, LLC's primary customer base includes all of the licensed cannabis cultivators, in the State of Nevada, who are required by law to have their products tested before they can be transferred to the dispensaries. Furthermore, MA has acquired all of the Membership interest in Harris Lee Holdings, LLC. Harris Lee Holdings, LLC was set up to take the MA model and testing operations to additional states above and beyond Nevada either in direct testing laboratories or through licensing the testing protocol. As such, MA is in a unique position to provide the mandated health and safety testing in this burgeoning industry. Lastly, Harris Lee Holdings, LLC, due to Colorado residency requirements, entered into an advisory agreement with Harris Lee Colorado, LLC, Harris Lee Holdings, LLC has sub-licensed the testing protocols to Harris Lee Colorado, LLC in exchange for a management fee for each test conducted. The Colorado MED approved the transfer of management of an existing laboratory, operating as Steep Hill Colorado, to Harris Lee Colorado, LLC (a related party) and Harris Lee Holdings, LLC has derived management fees from Harris Lee Colorado, LLC in the year ending December 31, 2016. All 2016 revenue was derived from these related-party management fees for the year ended December 31, 2016. However, because of the failure to transfer the MED license to Harris Lee Colorado, LLC, the Denver laboratory was closed by the end 2016. As of December 31, 2017, MA & Associates was not yet operational but still ramping up staff, policies, procedures and scientific methodologies. As of August 24, 2020, MA & Associates is operational and fully staffed. 
 
Growth Strategy
 
We plan to grow our assets and earnings per share by employing the following business strategies, all of which are dependent on securing further funding through debt and/or equity capital infusions:

· | Continue to support MA & Associates LLC and opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions. We plan to selectively pursue strategic, investments in, or acquisitions of, companies (like MA & Associates, LLC and Harris Lee Holdings, LLC) and assets that are complementary to our existing line of business.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Pazoo will continue to support and contribute to the growth strategy of MA & Associates LLC, which is licensed by the State of Nevada and the city of Las Vegas to test all aspects of potency, purity, and other criteria of cannabis products to determine an independent profile for any cannabis product.

Cannabis Testing Industry Trends
 
The marijuana testing industry will continue to increase as it is just in its infancy. Of the 50 US States, 47 have enacted some form of medical marijuana laws. The following States have legalized the recreational use of marijuana: Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington as well as the District of Columbia. Of the States that have enacted some form of medical marijuana laws, all have some type of testing guidelines. The State of Nevada has been recognized as the State with the strictest laboratory testing rules and requirements and is becoming the model for cannabis laboratory testing requirements for the rest of the county. 
Competition
 

· | Pharmaceutical Testing. Inasmuch as this industry is in its infancy, it is clear that there is currently competition and if the industry goes as we anticipate, new entrants to the market will be inevitable. However, there are certain barriers to entry which clearly benefit MA & Associates, LLC. For example:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. | Cost of establishing a testing laboratory. The cost to setting up a fully operational laboratory, depending on the variety and number of tests the laboratory can do, can range from $1,000,000 to $3,000,000. Pazoo has the advantage of going through this process with MA & Associates, LLC and has built relationships with equipment suppliers for the lease and/or purchase of the equipment needed to run a laboratory.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The Need for a Proven Set of Testing protocols. Nevada boasts the most stringent testing laws in the nation and we are developing our own standard testing protocols by which to operate in this state and subsequently in other states in the future. 
3. | Limited Number of Licenses to be Issued. Each state has its own regulations for the licensing of testing laboratories. Many states, such as Nevada, limit the number of licenses which may be issued. Accordingly, if the maximum number of licenses has been issued, there would be a complete bar to the entry of new competitors.
