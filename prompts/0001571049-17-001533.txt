(a) General Development of Business
 
Otter Tail Power Company was incorporated in 1907 under the laws of the State of Minnesota. In 2001, the name was changed to “Otter Tail Corporation” to more accurately represent the broader scope of consolidated operations and the name Otter Tail Power Company (OTP) was retained for use by the electric utility. On July 1, 2009 Otter Tail Corporation completed a holding company reorganization whereby OTP, which had previously been operated as a division of Otter Tail Corporation, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the new parent holding company named Otter Tail Corporation (the Company). The new parent holding company was incorporated in June 2009 under the laws of the State of Minnesota in connection with the holding company reorganization. The Company’s executive offices are located at 215 South Cascade Street, P.O. Box 496, Fergus Falls, Minnesota 56538-0496 and 4334 18th Avenue SW, Suite 200, P.O. Box 9156, Fargo, North Dakota 58106-9156. The Company’s telephone number is (866) 410-8780.
 
The Company makes available free of charge at its website (www.ottertail.com) its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed on behalf of directors and executive officers and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Information on the Company’s website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Otter Tail Corporation and its subsidiaries conduct business primarily in the United States. The Company had approximately 2,054 full-time employees in its continuing operations at December 31, 2016. The Company’s businesses have been classified in three segments to be consistent with its business strategy and the reporting and review process used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker. The three segments are Electric, Manufacturing and Plastics.
 
From 2011 through 2015 the Company sold several businesses in execution of an announced strategy to realign its business portfolio to reduce its risk profile and dedicate a greater portion of its resources toward electric utility operations. The following divestitures occurred in this timeframe:
 

· | In 2011, the Company sold Idaho Pacific Holdings, Inc., its Food Ingredient Processing business, and E.W. Wylie Corporation, its flat-bed trucking company.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In January 2012, the Company sold the assets of Aviva Sports, Inc., a recreational equipment manufacturer.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In February 2012, the Company sold DMS Health Technologies, Inc., its former Health Services segment business.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In November 2012, the Company completed the sale of the assets of its former wind tower company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On February 8, 2013 the Company sold substantially all the assets of its former dock and boatlift company.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | On February 28, 2015 the Company sold the assets of AEV, Inc., its former energy and electrical construction contractor, and on April 30, 2015 the Company sold Foley Company, its former water, wastewater, power and industrial construction contractor. With the sale of these two companies in 2015 the Company eliminated its Construction segment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On September 1, 2015 the Company acquired the assets of Impulse Manufacturing Inc. (Impulse) of Dawsonville, Georgia, now operating under the name BTD-Georgia, for a final adjusted payment of $29.3 million in cash. BTD-Georgia offers a wide range of metal fabrication services ranging from simple laser cutting services and high volume stamping to complex weldments and assemblies for metal fabrication buyers and original equipment manufacturers.
 
The chart below indicates the companies included in each of the Company’s reporting segments.

· | Electric includes the production, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota by OTP. In addition, OTP is a participant in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) markets. OTP’s operations have been the Company’s primary business since 1907. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Manufacturing consists of businesses in the following manufacturing activities: contract machining, metal parts stamping, fabrication and painting, and production of material and handling trays and horticultural containers. These businesses have manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Illinois and Minnesota and sell products primarily in the United States.
· | Plastics consists of businesses producing polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe at plants in North Dakota and Arizona. The PVC pipe is sold primarily in the upper Midwest and Southwest regions of the United States. 

 
OTP is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company’s manufacturing and plastic pipe businesses are owned by its wholly owned subsidiary, Varistar Corporation (Varistar). The Company’s corporate operating costs include items such as corporate staff and overhead costs, the results of the Company’s captive insurance company and other items excluded from the measurement of operating segment performance that are not allocated to its subsidiary companies. Corporate assets consist primarily of cash, prepaid expenses, investments and fixed assets. Corporate is not an operating segment. Rather, it is added to operating segment totals to reconcile to totals on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
The Company has lowered its overall risk by investing in rate base growth opportunities in its Electric segment and divesting certain nonelectric operating companies that no longer fit the Company’s portfolio criteria. This strategy has provided a more predictable earnings stream, improved the Company’s credit quality and preserved its ability to fund the dividend. The Company’s goal is to deliver annual growth in earnings per share between four to seven percent over the next several years, using 2016 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as the base for measurement. The growth is expected to come from the substantial increase in the Company’s regulated utility rate base and from planned increased earnings from existing capacity in place at the Company’s manufacturing and plastic pipe businesses, including the 2015 acquisition of BTD-Georgia and the facilities expansion and addition of paint services at BTD’s Minnesota facilities completed in 2016. The Company will continue to review its business portfolio to see where additional opportunities exist to improve its risk profile, improve credit metrics and generate additional sources of cash to support the growth opportunities in its electric utility. The Company will also evaluate opportunities to allocate capital to potential acquisitions in its Manufacturing and Plastics segments. Over time, the Company expects the electric utility business will provide approximately 75% to 85% of its overall earnings. The Company expects its manufacturing and plastic pipe businesses will provide 15% to 25% of its earnings, and will continue to be a fundamental part of its strategy. The actual mix of earnings from continuing operations in 2016 was 80% from the electric utility and 20% from the manufacturing and plastic pipe businesses, including unallocated corporate costs.
 
The Company maintains the following criteria in evaluating whether its operating companies are a strategic fit, the operating company:
 

· | Maintains a threshold level of net earnings and a return on invested capital in excess of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Has a strategic differentiation from competitors and a sustainable cost advantage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Operates within a stable and growing industry and is able to quickly adapt to changing economic cycles. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Has a strong management team committed to operational excellence.

North Dakota | | 38.4 | | | 40.6 | 
South Dakota | | 8.6 | | | 9.0 | 
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | %

 
The territory served by OTP is predominantly agricultural. The aggregate population of OTP’s retail electric service area is approximately 230,000. In this service area of 422 communities and adjacent rural areas and farms, approximately 126,000 people live in communities having a population of more than 1,000, according to the 2010 census. The only communities served which have a population in excess of 10,000 are Jamestown, North Dakota (15,427); Bemidji, Minnesota (13,431); and Fergus Falls, Minnesota (13,138). As of December 31, 2016 OTP served 131,546 customers. Although there are relatively few large customers, sales to commercial and industrial customers are significant.
 
The following table provides a breakdown of electric revenues by customer category. All other sources include gross wholesale sales from utility generation, net revenue from energy trading activity and sales to municipalities.

OTP has a direct control load management system which provides some flexibility to OTP to effect reductions of peak load. OTP also offers rates to customers which encourage off-peak usage.
 
OTP’s capacity requirement is based on MISO Module E requirements. OTP is required to have sufficient Zonal Resource Credits to meet its monthly weather normalized forecast demand, plus a reserve obligation. OTP met its MISO obligation for the 2016-2017 MISO planning year. OTP generating capacity combined with additional capacity under purchased power agreements (as described above) and load management control capabilities is expected to meet 2017 system demand and MISO reserve requirements.
 
Fuel Supply
 
Coal is the principal fuel burned at the Big Stone, Coyote and Hoot Lake generating plants. Coyote Station, a mine-mouth facility, burns North Dakota lignite coal. Hoot Lake Plant and Big Stone Plant burn western subbituminous coal.
 
The following table shows the sources of energy used to generate OTP’s net output of electricity for 2016 and 2015:
 

 | 2016 | | 2015 
--------------------+----------------------------------+-----------+----------------------------

Total | | 2,821,779 | | 100.0 | % | 2,305,968 | 100.0 | %

 
OTP has the following primary coal supply agreements:
 

Plant | Coal Supplier | Type of Coal | Expiration Date 
----------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------------+------------------
Big Stone Plant | Contura Coal Sales, LLC | Wyoming subbituminous | December 31, 2017
Big Stone Plant | Peabody COALSALES, LLC | Wyoming subbituminous | December 31, 2017
Coyote Station | Coyote Creek Mining Company, L.L.C. | North Dakota lignite | December 31, 2040
Hoot Lake Plant | Cloud Peak Energy Resources LLC | Montana subbituminous | December 31, 2023

 
OTP’s anticipated coal needs for Big Stone Plant are secured under contract through December 2017.
 
In October 2012 the Coyote Station owners, including OTP, entered into a lignite sales agreement (LSA) with Coyote Creek Mining Company, L.L.C. (CCMC), a subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, for the purchase of coal to meet the coal supply requirements of Coyote Station for the period beginning in May 2016 and ending in December 2040. The price per ton being paid by the Coyote Station owners under the LSA reflects the cost of production, along with an agreed profit and capital charge. The LSA provides for the Coyote Station owners to purchase the membership interests in CCMC in the event of certain early termination events and also at the end of the term of the LSA.
 
OTP’s coal supply requirements for Hoot Lake Plant are secured under contract through December 2023.

Railroad transportation services to the Big Stone Plant and Hoot Lake Plant are provided under a common carrier rate by the BNSF Railway. The common carrier rate is subject to a mileage-based methodology to assess a fuel surcharge. The basis for the fuel surcharge is the U.S. average price of retail on-highway diesel fuel. No coal transportation agreement is needed for Coyote Station due to its location next to a coal mine.
 
The average cost of fuel consumed (including handling charges to the plant sites) per million British Thermal Units (Btu) for the years 2016, 2015, and 2014 was $2.146, $2.281 and $2.036, respectively.
 
General Regulation
 
OTP is subject to regulation of rates and other matters in each of the three states in which it operates and by the federal government for certain interstate operations.
 
A breakdown of electric rate regulation by each jurisdiction is as follows:
 

 | | 2016 | | | 2015 
-------------------------+--------------------------------------+-------------------------+-------+---+----------------
Rates | Regulation | % of Electric Revenues | | | % of kwh Sales | | % of Electric Revenues | % of kwh Sales | 
MN Retail Sales | MN Public Utilities Commission | | 47.5 | % | | 54.0 | % | 47.2 | % | 52.0 | %
ND Retail Sales | ND Public Service Commission | | 34.4 | | | 37.1 | | 38.0 | | 38.7 | 
SD Retail Sales | SD Public Utilities Commission | | 7.8 | | | 8.9 | | 8.5 | | 9.3 | 
Transmission & Wholesale | Federal Energy Regulatory Commission | | 10.3 | | | — | | 6.3 | | — | 
Total | | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 
OTP operates under approved retail electric tariffs in all three states it serves. OTP has an obligation to serve any customer requesting service within its assigned service territory. The pattern of electric usage can vary dramatically during a 24-hour period and from season to season. OTP’s tariffs are designed to recover the costs of providing electric service. To the extent peak usage can be reduced or shifted to periods of lower usage, the cost to serve all customers is reduced. In order to shift usage from peak times, OTP has approved tariffs in all three states for residential demand control, general service time of use and time of day, real-time pricing, and controlled and interruptible service. Each of these specialized rates is designed to improve efficient use of OTP resources, while giving customers more control over their electric bill. OTP also has approved tariffs in its three service territories which allow qualifying customers to release and sell energy back to OTP when wholesale energy prices make such transactions desirable.
 
With a few minor exceptions, OTP’s electric retail rate schedules provide for adjustments in rates based on the cost of fuel delivered to OTP’s generating plants, as well as for adjustments based on the cost of electric energy purchased by OTP. OTP also credits certain margins from wholesale sales to the fuel and purchased power adjustment. The adjustments for fuel and purchased power costs are presently based on a two month moving average in Minnesota and by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), a three month moving average in South Dakota and a four month moving average in North Dakota. These adjustments are applied to the next billing period after becoming applicable. These adjustments also include an over or under recovery mechanism, which is calculated on an annual basis in Minnesota and on a monthly basis in North Dakota and South Dakota.
 
Below are descriptions of OTP’s major capital expenditure projects that have had, or will have, a significant impact on OTP’s revenue requirements, rates and alternative revenue recovery mechanisms, followed by summaries of the material regulations of each jurisdiction applicable to OTP’s electric operations, as well as any specific electric rate proceedings during the last three years with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC), the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC), the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC) and the FERC. The Company’s manufacturing and plastic pipe businesses are not subject to direct regulation by any of these agencies.
 
Major Capital Expenditure Projects
 
The Big Stone South – Brookings MVP and CapX2020 Project—This 345 kiloVolt (kV) transmission line, currently under construction, will extend approximately 70 miles between a substation near Big Stone City, South Dakota and the Brookings County Substation near Brookings, South Dakota. OTP and Northern States Power – MN (NSP MN), a subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., jointly developed this project, and the parties will have equal ownership interest in the transmission line portion of the project. MISO approved this project as a Multi-Value Project (MVP) under the MISO Open Access Transmission, Energy and Operating Reserve Markets Tariff (MISO Tariff) in December 2011. MVPs are designed to enable the region to comply with energy policy mandates and to address reliability and economic issues affecting multiple areas within the MISO region. The cost allocation is designed to ensure the costs of transmission projects with regional benefits are properly

Fargo–Monticello 345 kV CapX2020 Project (the Fargo Project)—OTP has invested approximately $81 million and has a 14.2% ownership interest in the jointly-owned assets of this 240-mile transmission line, and owns 100% of certain assets of the project. The final phase of this project was energized on April 2, 2015.
 
Brookings–Southeast Twin Cities 345 kV CapX2020 Project (the Brookings Project)—OTP has invested approximately $26 million and has a 4.8% ownership interest in this 250-mile transmission line. The MISO granted unconditional approval of the Brookings Project as an MVP under the MISO Tariff in December 2011. The final segments of this line were energized on March 26, 2015.
Big Stone Plant Air Quality Control System (AQCS)— OTP completed construction and testing of the Big Stone Plant AQCS in the fourth quarter of 2015 and placed the AQCS into commercial operation on December 29, 2015. OTP’s capitalized cost of the project, excluding allowance for funds used during construction, was approximately $200 million.
 
Recovery of OTP’s major transmission investments is through the MISO Tariff (several as MVPs) and, currently, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota Transmission Cost Recovery (TCR) Riders.
 
Minnesota
 
Under the Minnesota Public Utilities Act, OTP is subject to the jurisdiction of the MPUC with respect to rates, issuance of securities, depreciation rates, public utility services, construction of major utility facilities, establishment of exclusive assigned service areas, contracts and arrangements with subsidiaries and other affiliated interests, and other matters. The MPUC has the authority to assess the need for large energy facilities and to issue or deny certificates of need, after public hearings, within one year of an application to construct such a facility.
 
Pursuant to the Minnesota Power Plant Siting Act, the MPUC has authority to select or designate sites in Minnesota for new electric power generating plants (50,000 kW or more) and routes for transmission lines (100 kV or more) in an orderly manner compatible with environmental preservation and the efficient use of resources, and to certify such sites and routes as to environmental compatibility after an environmental impact study has been conducted by the Minnesota Department of Commerce (MNDOC) and the Office of Administrative Hearings has conducted contested case hearings.
 
The Minnesota Division of Energy Resources, part of the MNDOC, is responsible for investigating all matters subject to the jurisdiction of the MNDOC or the MPUC, and for the enforcement of MPUC orders. Among other things, the MNDOC is authorized to collect and analyze data on energy including the consumption of energy, develop recommendations as to energy policies for the governor and the legislature of Minnesota and evaluate policies governing the establishment of rates and prices for energy as related to energy conservation. The MNDOC also has the power, in the event of energy shortage or for a long-term basis, to prepare and adopt regulations to conserve and allocate energy.

2016 General Rate Case—On February 16, 2016 OTP filed a request with the MPUC for an increase in revenue recoverable under general rates in Minnesota. In its filing, OTP requested an allowed rate of return on rate base of 8.07% and an allowed rate of return on equity of 10.4% based on an equity ratio of 52.5% of total capital. On April 14, 2016 the MPUC issued an order approving an interim rate increase of 9.56% to the base rate portion of customers’ bills effective April 16, 2016, as modified and subject to refund. The request and interim rate information is detailed in the table below:

($ in thousands) | Annualized or Test Year | | | Actual Through December 31, 2016 | 
---------------------------------------------+--------------------------+---------+---+-----------------------------------+--
Revenue Increase Requested | $ | 19,296 | | | | 
Increase Percentage Requested | | 9.80 | % | | | 
Jurisdictional Rate Base | $ | 483,000 | | | | 
Interim Revenue Increase (subject to refund) | $ | 16,816 | | | $ | 10,976

 
The major components of the requested rate increase are summarized below:
 

Revenue Requirement Deficiency Cost Factors (in thousands) | 2016 Test Year Allocation | 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------+-------
Increased Rate Base | $ | 10,000 | 
Increased Expenses | | 7,700 | 
Other | | 1,596 | 
Total Requested Revenue Increase | $ | 19,296 | 
Excluded from Interim Rates: Rate Base Effect of Prepaid Pension Asset | | (2,480 | )
Approved Interim Revenue Increase (subject to refund) | $ | 16,816 | 

 
The deadline for submission of intervenor direct testimony was August 16, 2016. Direct testimony of the MNDOC included a recommendation for an 8.87% allowed rate of return on equity, and direct testimony of the Minnesota Office of the Attorney General (OAG) included a recommendation for a 6.96% allowed rate of return on equity. In response, in rebuttal testimony, OTP modified its request to provide for an allowed rate of return on equity of 10.05%. In rebuttal testimony, the MNDOC revised its recommendation to an 8.66% allowed rate of return on equity, and the Minnesota OAG revised its recommendation to a 7.14% allowed rate of return on equity. Hearings before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) occurred in October 2016. On January 5, 2017 the ALJ’s report was issued which included a recommendation for a 9.54% allowed rate of return on equity.
 
Based on OTP’s modifications to its original request and other expected outcomes in the aforementioned rate case, OTP has recorded an estimated interim rate refund of $3.6 million as of December 31, 2016. Oral arguments before the MPUC are expected to occur in late February 2017. The MPUC is expected to make its final decision in March 2017 and issue its written order in spring 2017.
 
2010 General Rate Case—OTP’s most recently completed general rate increase in Minnesota of approximately $5.0 million, or 1.6%, was granted by the MPUC in an order issued on April 25, 2011 and effective October 1, 2011. Pursuant to the order, OTP’s allowed rate of return on rate base increased from 8.33% to 8.61% and its allowed rate of return on equity increased from 10.43% to 10.74%.
Integrated Resource Plan (IRP)—Minnesota law requires utilities to submit to the MPUC for approval a 15-year advance IRP. A resource plan is a set of resource options a utility could use to meet the service needs of its customers over a forecast period, including an explanation of the utility’s supply and demand circumstances, and the extent to which each resource option would be used to meet those service needs. The MPUC’s findings of fact and conclusions regarding resource plans shall be considered prima facie evidence, subject to rebuttal, in Certificate of Need (CON) hearings, rate reviews and other proceedings. Typically, the filings are submitted every two years.
 
On December 5, 2014 the MPUC issued an order approving OTP’s 2014-2028 IRP filing, which included the following items:
 

· | Authorization to add up to 300 MW of wind between 2017 and 2021 if it is cost effective and does not negatively impact OTP’s electric system operation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Construction of solar generation sufficient to comply with the Minnesota Solar Energy Standard by 2020.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Confirmation of a 1.5% energy savings goal, as filed in OTP’s triennial Minnesota Conservation Improvement Program (MNCIP) plan.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Authorization to obtain 200 MW, subject to need, of intermediate natural gas generation in the 2019-2021 timeframe.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


10
--

 

On September 14, 2015 the MPUC granted OTP a six-month extension to June 1, 2016 to file its latest IRP. The extension allowed OTP time to model compliance with final rules on proposed standards of performance for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on October 23, 2015 and to incorporate planned wind and natural gas-fired generation additions.
 
OTP filed its 2017-2031 IRP with the MPUC on June 1, 2016, which included the following items:
 

· | Adding 200 megawatts (MW) of wind resources (100 MW in 2018 and 100 MW in 2020) and authorization to add up to 100 MW more at a later time. With three 100-MW additions to OTP’s wind energy resources, wind would serve approximately 34% of OTP’s customers' energy needs. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Adding 30 MW of solar resources by 2020 to comply with Minnesota's Solar Energy Standard. 
· | Adding a 248 MW simple-cycle natural gas-fired plant in 2021 to replace Hoot Lake Plant’s two coal-fired steam turbines to be retired in 2021. The natural gas-fired plant will likely be located in close proximity to a high-voltage transmission line and a large natural gas pipeline within OTP’s service area.

 
OTP expects the MPUC hearing on the 2017-2031 IRP to occur in late February or early March 2017.
 
Renewable Energy Standards, Conservation, Renewable Resource Riders—Minnesota law favors conservation over the addition of new resources. In addition, Minnesota law requires the use of renewable resources where new supplies are needed, unless the utility proves that a renewable energy facility is not in the public interest. An existing environmental externality law requires the MPUC, to the extent practicable, to quantify the environmental costs associated with each method of electricity generation, and to use such monetized values in evaluating generation resources. The MPUC must disallow any nonrenewable rate base additions (whether within or outside of the state) or any related rate recovery, and may not approve any nonrenewable energy facility in an IRP, unless the utility proves that a renewable energy facility is not in the public interest. The state has prioritized the acceptability of new generation with wind and solar ranked first and coal and nuclear ranked fifth, the lowest ranking. The MPUC’s current estimate of the range of costs of future CO2 regulation to be used in modeling analyses for resource plans is $9 to $34/ton of CO2 commencing in 2022. The MPUC is required to annually update these estimates.
 
Minnesota has a renewable energy standard which requires OTP to generate or procure sufficient renewable generation such that the following percentages of total retail electric sales to Minnesota customers come from qualifying renewable sources: 17% by 2016; 20% by 2020 and 25% by 2025. In addition, Minnesota law requires 1.5% of total Minnesota electric sales by public utilities to be supplied by solar energy by 2020. At least 10% of the 1.5% requirement must be met by solar energy generated by or procured from solar photovoltaic devices with a nameplate capacity of 20 kWs or less. Under certain circumstances and after consideration of costs and reliability issues, the MPUC may modify or delay implementation of the standards. OTP has acquired sufficient renewable resources to currently comply with Minnesota renewable energy standards. OTP is evaluating potential options for maintaining compliance and meeting the solar energy standard. OTP’s projected capital expenditures include $40 million for a solar project in 2019. OTP’s compliance with the Minnesota renewable energy standard will be measured through the Midwest Renewable Energy Tracking System.
 
Under the Next Generation Energy Act of 2007, an automatic adjustment mechanism was established to allow Minnesota electric utilities to recover investments and costs incurred to satisfy the requirements of the renewable energy standard. The MPUC is authorized to approve a rate schedule rider to enable utilities to recover the costs of qualifying renewable energy projects that supply renewable energy to Minnesota customers. Cost recovery for qualifying renewable energy projects can be authorized outside of a rate case proceeding, provided that such renewable projects have received previous MPUC approval. Renewable resource costs eligible for recovery may include return on investment, depreciation, operation and maintenance costs, taxes, renewable energy delivery costs and other related expenses.
 
Minnesota Conservation Improvement Programs—Under Minnesota law, every regulated public utility that furnishes electric service must make annual investments and expenditures in energy conservation improvements, or make a contribution to the state's energy and conservation account, in an amount equal to at least 1.5% of its gross operating revenues from service provided in Minnesota.
 
The MNDOC may require a utility to make investments and expenditures in energy conservation improvements whenever it finds that the improvement will result in energy savings at a total cost to the utility less than the cost to the utility to produce or purchase an equivalent amount of a new supply of energy. Such MNDOC orders can be appealed to the MPUC. Investments made pursuant to such orders generally are recoverable costs in rate cases, even though ownership of the improvement may belong to the property owner rather than the utility. OTP recovers conservation related costs not included in base rates under the MNCIP through the use of an annual recovery mechanism approved by the MPUC.

On September 26, 2014 the MPUC approved OTP’s 2013 financial incentive request for $4.0 million, an updated surcharge rate to be effective October 1, 2014, as well as a change to the carrying charge to be equal to the short term cost of debt set in OTP’s most recent general rate case.
 
OTP recognized a financial incentive for 2014 of $3.0 million due, in part, to the MPUC lowering the MNCIP financial incentive from approximately $0.09 per kwh saved for 2013-2015 to $0.07 per kwh saved for 2014-2016. Additionally, OTP saved approximately 2 million less kwhs in 2014 compared with 2013 under conservation improvement programs in Minnesota. On July 9, 2015 the MPUC granted approval of OTP’s 2014 financial incentive of $3.0 million along with an updated surcharge with an effective date of October 1, 2015.
 
Based on results from the 2015 MNCIP program year, OTP recognized a financial incentive of $4.2 million. The 2015 MNCIP program resulted in an approximate 39% increase in energy savings compared to 2014 program results. On April 1, 2016 OTP requested approval for recovery of its 2015 MNCIP program costs not included in base rates, a $4.3 million financial incentive and an update to the MNCIP surcharge from the MPUC. On July 19, 2016 the MPUC issued an order approving OTP’s request with an effective date of October 1, 2016.
 
Based on results from the 2016 MNCIP program year, OTP recognized a financial incentive of $5.1 million in 2016. The 2016 program resulted in an approximate 18% increase in energy savings compared to 2015 program results. OTP will request approval for recovery of its 2016 MNCIP program costs not included in base rates, a $5.1 million financial incentive and an update to the MNCIP surcharge from the MPUC by April 1, 2017.
 
On May 25, 2016 the MPUC adopted the MNDOC’s proposed changes to the MNCIP financial incentive. The new model will provide utilities an incentive of 13.5% of 2017 net benefits, 12% of 2018 net benefits and 10% of 2019 net benefits, assuming the utility achieves 1.7% savings compared to retail sales. OTP estimates the impact of the new model will reduce the MNCIP financial incentive by approximately 50% compared to the previous incentive mechanism.
 
In 2016 the MNDOC opened an additional docket to investigate how investor-owned utilities calculate their avoided costs pertaining to generation capacity, energy, transmission and distribution. Avoided costs are the basis of MNCIP program benefits which, going forward, will establish OTP’s financial incentive. On May 23, 2016 the MNDOC accepted OTP’s 2017 avoided costs calculation, but is requiring Minnesota investor-owned utilities to undergo an analysis of transmission and distribution avoided costs for 2018 and 2019. OTP is participating in a stakeholder group with the MNDOC, Xcel Energy Inc., and Minnesota Power to determine the best method for calculating avoided costs. Results from this work should be submitted to the MNDOC in the second quarter of 2017.
 
Transmission Cost Recovery Rider—The Minnesota Public Utilities Act (the MPU Act) provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment outside of a general rate proceeding to recover the costs of new transmission facilities that have been previously approved by the MPUC in a CON proceeding, certified by the MPUC as a Minnesota priority transmission project, made to transmit the electricity generated from renewable generation sources ultimately used to provide service to the utility's retail customers, or exempt from the requirement to obtain a Minnesota CON. The MPUC may also authorize cost recovery via such TCR riders for charges incurred by a utility under a federally approved tariff that accrue from other transmission owners’ regionally planned transmission projects that have been determined by the MISO to benefit the utility or integrated transmission system. The MPU Act also authorizes TCR riders to recover the costs of new transmission facilities approved by the regulatory commission of the state in which the new transmission facilities are to be constructed, to the extent approval is required by the laws of that state, and determined by the MISO to benefit the utility or integrated transmission system. Finally, under certain circumstances, the MPU Act also authorizes TCR riders to recover the costs associated with distribution planning and investments in distribution facilities to modernize the utility grid. Such TCR riders allow a return on investment at the level approved in a utility’s last general rate case. Additionally, following approval of the rate schedule, the MPUC may approve annual rate adjustments filed pursuant to the rate schedule. MISO regional cost allocation allows OTP to recover some of the costs of its transmission investment from other MISO customers.
 
OTP filed an annual update to its Minnesota TCR rider on February 7, 2013 to include three new projects as well as updated costs associated with existing projects. In a written order issued on March 10, 2014, the MPUC approved OTP’s 2013 TCR rider update but found capitalized internal costs, costs in excess of CON estimates and a carrying charge ineligible for recovery through the TCR rider. These items were removed from OTP’s Minnesota TCR rider effective March 1, 2014. OTP is seeking recovery of the capitalized internal costs and costs in excess of CON estimates in its current general rate case filing in Minnesota. In response to the MPUC’s approval of OTP’s annual TCR update, OTP submitted a compliance filing in April 2014 reflecting the TCR rider revenue requirements changes relating to the MPUC’s ruling and requesting no rate change be implemented at the time. The MPUC approved OTP’s compliance filing on June 19, 2014. On February 18, 2015 the MPUC approved OTP’s 2014 TCR rider annual update with an effective date of March 1, 2015. OTP filed an annual update to its Minnesota TCR rider on September 30, 2015 requesting revenue recovery of approximately $7.8 million. A supplemental filing to the update was made on December 21, 2015 to address an issue surrounding the proration of accumulated deferred

income taxes and, in an unrelated adjustment, the TCR rider update revenue request was reduced to $7.2 million. On March 9, 2016 the MPUC issued an order approving OTP’s annual update to its TCR rider, with an effective date of April 1, 2016.
 
OTP filed an update to its TCR rider on April 29, 2016 to incorporate the impact of bonus depreciation for income taxes, an adjusted rate of return on rate base and allocation factors to align with its 2016 general rate case request. On July 5, 2016 the MPUC issued an order approving the proposed rates on a provisional basis, as recommended by the MNDOC. The proposed rate changes went into effect on September 1, 2016. The MPUC granted extensions to the MNDOC to file initial comments in this docket until February 2, 2017.
 
In OTP’s 2016 general rate case, the MNDOC has argued that the MPUC should require OTP to include in the TCR rider retail rate base 100% of OTP’s investment in the Big Stone South – Brookings and Big Stone South – Ellendale MVP Projects and all revenues received from other utilities under MISO’s tariffed rates as a credit in its TCR revenue requirement calculations. OTP has opposed this treatment, arguing the projects are appropriately assigned to the FERC jurisdiction, and the FERC’s determination of the projects’ revenue requirements should not be altered by forcing the revenues into the retail revenue requirement calculations. In the general rate case proceeding, the ALJ recommended that the MPUC should affirm OTP’s treatment. If the MPUC finds that the MNDOC’s treatment should be followed, it would result in the projects being treated as retail investments for Minnesota retail ratemaking purposes. Because the FERC’s revenue requirements and authorized returns will vary from the MPUC revenue requirements and authorized returns for the project investments over the lives of the projects, the impact of this decision will vary over time and be dependent on the differences between the revenue requirements and returns in the two jurisdictions at any given time.
 
Environmental Cost Recovery (ECR) Rider—On December 18, 2013 the MPUC granted approval of OTP’s Minnesota ECR rider for recovery of OTP’s Minnesota jurisdictional share of the revenue requirements of its investment in the Big Stone Plant AQCS effective January 1, 2014. The ECR rider recoverable revenue requirements included a return on the project’s construction work in progress (CWIP) balance at the level approved in OTP’s 2010 general rate case. The MPUC approved OTP’s 2014 ECR rider annual update request on November 24, 2014 with an effective date of December 1, 2014. OTP filed its 2015 annual update on July 31, 2015, with a request to keep the 2014 annual update rate in place. On December 21, 2015 OTP filed a supplemental filing with updated financial information. The MPUC issued an order on March 9, 2016 approving OTP’s request to leave the 2014 annual update rate in place. OTP filed an update to its Minnesota ECR rider on April 29, 2016 to incorporate the impact of bonus depreciation for income taxes, an adjusted rate of return on rate base and allocation factors to align with its 2016 general rate case request, with an effective date of September 1, 2016. On July 5, 2016 the MPUC issued an order approving the proposed rates on a provisional basis and has since granted extensions to the MNDOC to file initial comments in this docket until February 2, 2017. Reply comments were due from OTP on February 13, 2017.
Reagent Costs and Emission Allowances—On July 31, 2014 OTP filed a request with the MPUC to revise its Fuel Clause Adjustment (FCA) rider in Minnesota to include recovery of reagent and emission allowance costs. On March 12, 2015 the MPUC denied OTP’s request to revise its FCA rider to include recovery of these costs. These costs are included in OTP’s 2016 general rate case in Minnesota and are being considered for recovery either through the FCA rider or general rates. These costs are currently being expensed as incurred.
Capital Structure Petition—Minnesota law requires an annual filing of a capital structure petition with the MPUC. In this filing the MPUC reviews and approves the capital structure for OTP. Once the petition is approved, OTP may issue securities without further petition or approval, provided the issuance is consistent with the purposes and amounts set forth in the approved capital structure petition. The MPUC approved OTP’s most recent capital structure petition on August 2, 2016, allowing for an equity to total capitalization ratio between 47.5% and 58.1%, with total capitalization not to exceed $1,123,168,000 until the MPUC issues a new capital structure order for 2017. OTP is required to file its 2017 capital structure petition no later than May 1, 2017.
North Dakota
 
OTP is subject to the jurisdiction of the NDPSC with respect to rates, services, certain issuances of securities, construction of major utility facilities and other matters. The NDPSC periodically performs audits of gas and electric utilities over which it has rate setting jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of overall rate levels. In the past, these audits have occasionally resulted in settlement agreements adjusting rate levels for OTP.
 
The North Dakota Energy Conversion and Transmission Facility Siting Act grants the NDPSC the authority to approve sites in North Dakota for large electric generating facilities and high voltage transmission lines. This Act is similar to the Minnesota Power Plant Siting Act described above and applies to proposed wind energy electric power generating plants exceeding 500 kW of electricity, non-wind energy electric power generating plants exceeding 50,000 kW and transmission lines with a design in excess of 115 kV. OTP is required to submit a ten-year plan to the NDPSC biennially.

The NDPSC reserves the right to review the issuance of stocks, bonds, notes and other evidence of indebtedness of a public utility. However, the issuance by a public utility of securities registered with the SEC is expressly exempted from review by the NDPSC under North Dakota state law.
 
General Rates—OTP’s most recent general rate increase in North Dakota of $3.6 million, or approximately 3.0%, was granted by the NDPSC in an order issued on November 25, 2009 and effective December 2009. Pursuant to the order, OTP’s allowed rate of return on rate base was set at 8.62%, and its allowed rate of return on equity was set at 10.75%.
Renewable Resource Adjustment—OTP has a North Dakota Renewable Resource Adjustment (NDRRA) which enables OTP to recover the North Dakota share of its investments in renewable energy facilities it owns in North Dakota. This rider allows OTP to recover costs associated with new renewable energy projects as they are completed, along with a return on investment. The NDPSC approved OTP’s 2013 annual update to its NDRRA on March 12, 2014 with an effective date of April 1, 2014, which resulted in a 13.5% reduction in the NDRRA rate. The NDPSC approved OTP’s 2014 annual update to the NDRRA, including a change in rate design from an amount per kwh consumed to a percentage of a customer’s bill, on March 25, 2015 with an effective date of April 1, 2015. OTP submitted its 2015 annual update to the NDRRA rider rate on December 31, 2015 with a requested implementation date of April 1, 2016. On February 25, 2016 OTP made a supplemental filing to address the impact of bonus depreciation for income taxes and related deferred tax assets on the NDRRA, as well as an adjustment to the estimated amount of Federal Production Tax Credits used. The NDPSC approved the NDRRA 2015 annual update on June 22, 2016 with an effective date of July 1, 2016. The updated NDRRA reflects a reduction in the return on equity (ROE) component of the rate from 10.75%, approved in OTP’s most recent general rate case, to 10.50%. OTP submitted its 2016 annual update to the NDRRA rider rate on December 30, 2016, requesting a decrease to the NDRRA rate from 7.573% to 7.005%, with a requested implementation date of April 1, 2017.
Transmission Cost Recovery Rider—North Dakota law provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment outside of a general rate proceeding to recover jurisdictional capital and operating costs incurred by a public utility for new or modified electric transmission facilities. For qualifying projects, the law authorizes a current return on CWIP and a return on investment at the level approved in the utility's most recent general rate case. The NDPSC approved OTP’s 2014 annual update to its TCR rider rate on December 17, 2014 with an effective date of January 1, 2015. On August 31, 2015 OTP filed its 2015 annual update to its North Dakota TCR rider rate requesting recovery of approximately $10.2 million for 2016 compared with $8.5 million for 2015, including costs assessed by the MISO as well as new costs from the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) that OTP began incurring January 1, 2016. These new costs are associated with OTP’s load connected to the transmission system of Central Power Electric Cooperative (CPEC). OTP’s load became subject to SPP transmission-related charges when CPEC transmission assets were added to the SPP. The NDPSC approved OTP’s 2015 annual update to its TCR rider rate on December 16, 2015, with an effective date of January 1, 2016. On September 1, 2016 OTP filed its annual update to the TCR rider requesting a revenue requirement of $5.7 million, which includes a reduction of $2.6 million for a projected over-collection for 2016. Primary drivers of the decrease from the 2015 updated rider rate include the impact of federal bonus depreciation and unresolved MISO ROE complaint proceedings. OTP filed a supplemental filing on September 14, 2016, requesting that the over-collection balance be spread over the next two years for purposes of reducing the volatility of the rates from year to year. The NDPSC approved the update on December 14, 2016. The new rates went into effect on January 1, 2017.
Environmental Cost Recovery Rider—On December 18, 2013 the NDPSC approved OTP’s request for an ECR rider to recover OTP’s North Dakota jurisdictional share of the revenue requirements associated with its investment in the Big Stone Plant AQCS. The ECR provides for a current return on CWIP and a return on investment at the level approved in OTP’s most recent general rate case. On March 31, 2014 OTP filed an annual update to its North Dakota ECR rider rate. The update included a request to increase the ECR rider rate from 4.319% of base rates to 7.531% of base rates. The NDPSC approved OTP’s 2014 ECR rider annual update request on July 10, 2014 with an August 1, 2014 implementation date. On March 31, 2015 OTP filed its annual update to the ECR. This update included a request to increase the ECR rider rate from 7.531% to 9.193% of base rates. The NDPSC approved the annual update on June 17, 2015 with an effective date of July 1, 2015, along with the approval of recovery of OTP’s North Dakota jurisdictional share of Hoot Lake Plant Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) project costs.
 
On March 31, 2016 OTP filed its annual update to the ECR rider requesting a reduction in the rate from 9.193% to 7.904% of base rates, or a revenue requirement reduction from $12.2 million to $10.4 million, effective July 1, 2016. The rate reduction request was primarily due to the Company’s 2015 bonus depreciation election for income taxes, which reduces revenue requirements. The filing was approved on June 22, 2016.
 
Reagent Costs and Emission Allowances—On July 31, 2014 OTP filed a request with the NDPSC to revise its FCA rider in North Dakota to include recovery of new reagent and emission allowance costs. On February 25, 2015 the NDPSC approved recovery of these costs through modification of the ECR rider, instead of recovery through the FCA as OTP had proposed. The ECR rider reagent and emissions allowance charge became effective May 1, 2015.

South Dakota
 
Under the South Dakota Public Utilities Act, OTP is subject to the jurisdiction of the SDPUC with respect to rates, public utility services, construction of major utility facilities, establishment of assigned service areas and other matters. Under the South Dakota Energy Facility Permit Act, the SDPUC has the authority to approve sites in South Dakota for large energy conversion facilities (100,000 kW or more) and transmission lines with a design of 115 kV or more.
2010 General Rate Case—OTP’s most recent general rate increase in South Dakota of approximately $643,000 or approximately 2.32% was granted by the SDPUC in an order issued on April 21, 2011 and effective with bills rendered on and after June 1, 2011. Pursuant to the order, OTP’s allowed rate of return on rate base was set at 8.50%.
Transmission Cost Recovery Rider—South Dakota law provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment outside of a general rate proceeding to recover jurisdictional capital and operating costs incurred by a public utility for new or modified electric transmission facilities. The SDPUC approved OTP’s 2013 annual update on February 18, 2014 with an effective date of March 1, 2014. The SDPUC approved OTP’s 2014 annual update on February 13, 2015 with an effective date of March 1, 2015. OTP filed its 2015 annual update on October 30, 2015 with a proposed effective date of March 1, 2016. A supplemental filing was made on February 3, 2016 to true-up the filing to include the impact of bonus depreciation elected for 2015, the inclusion of a deferred tax asset relating to a net operating loss and the proration of accumulated deferred income taxes. This update included the recovery of new SPP transmission costs OTP began to incur on January 1, 2016. On February 12, 2016 the SDPUC approved OTP’s annual update to its TCR rider, with an effective date of March 1, 2016. On November 1, 2016 OTP filed the annual update to the South Dakota TCR rider. OTP made a supplemental filing on January 20, 2017 to include updated costs through December 2016 as well as updated forecast information. The proposed effective date of the new rates is March 1, 2017.
Environmental Cost Recovery Rider—On November 25, 2014 the SDPUC approved OTP’s ECR rider request to recover OTP’s South Dakota jurisdictional share of revenue requirements associated with its investment in the Big Stone Plant AQCS and Hoot Lake Plant MATS projects, with an effective date of December 1, 2014. On August 31, 2015 OTP filed its annual update to the South Dakota ECR requesting recovery of approximately $2.7 million in annual revenue. The SDPUC approved the request on October 15, 2015 with an effective date of November 1, 2015. On August 31, 2016 OTP filed its 2016 update to the ECR rider, requesting recovery of approximately $2.3 million in annual revenue. The SDPUC approved the request on October 26, 2016 with an effective date of November 1, 2016. The lower revenue requirement is a result of the implementation of federal bonus depreciation taken on the Big Stone Plant AQCS.
Reagent Costs and Emission Allowances—On August 1, 2014 OTP filed a request with the SDPUC to revise its FCA rider in South Dakota to include recovery of reagent and emission allowance costs. On September 16, 2014 the SDPUC approved OTP’s request to include recovery of these costs in its South Dakota FCA rider.
Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP)—The SDPUC has encouraged all investor-owned utilities in South Dakota to be part of an Energy Efficiency Partnership to significantly reduce energy use. The plan is being implemented with program costs, carrying costs and a financial incentive being recovered through an approved rider.
 
On May 1, 2014 OTP filed a request with the SDPUC for approval of updates to its EEP based on 2013 results. On August 26, 2014 the SDPUC issued a written order approving the maximum available incentive payment limited to 30% of the budget amount provided in the EEP, or $84,000. In addition to the incentive payment approval, the SDPUC approved OTP’s proposal to leave the South Dakota Energy Efficiency Adjustment Rider at $0.00103/kwh.
 
On May 1, 2015 OTP filed its 2014 South Dakota EEP Status Report, financial incentive and surcharge adjustment along with a request for approval of an incentive of $105,000 and EEP surcharge increase to $0.00152/kwh. On July 14, 2015 the SDPUC issued a written order approving OTP’s 2014 EEP Status Report, incentive and surcharge increases.
 
On April 29, 2016 OTP filed its 2015 South Dakota EEP Status Report, financial incentive and surcharge adjustment with the SDPUC. The filing requested approval of an incentive of $105,900 and a decrease in the EEP surcharge from $0.00152/kwh to $0.00114/kwh effective July 1, 2016. The SDPUC approved the request. On April 29, 2016 OTP also filed its 2017-2019 goals and budgets for its South Dakota EEP triennial plan. For the 2017, 2018 and 2019 EEP planning years, OTP has proposed energy savings goals and budgets of 3,804,094 kwh and $449,000 in 2017, 3,805,177 kwh and $449,000 in 2018 and 3,806,262 kwh and $449,000 in 2019. On November 22, 2016 the SDPUC approved OTP’s 2017-2019 EEP triennial plan with certain conditions.

FERC
 
Wholesale power sales and transmission rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act of 1935, as amended. The FERC is an independent agency with jurisdiction over rates for wholesale electricity sales, transmission and sale of electric energy in interstate commerce, interconnection of facilities, and accounting policies and practices. Filed rates are effective after a one day suspension period, subject to ultimate approval by the FERC.
Multi-Value Transmission Projects—On December 16, 2010 the FERC approved the cost allocation for a new classification of projects in the MISO region called MVPs. MVPs are designed to enable the region to comply with energy policy mandates and to address reliability and economic issues affecting multiple transmission zones within the MISO region. The cost allocation is designed to ensure that the costs of transmission projects with regional benefits are properly assigned to those who benefit. On October 20, 2011 the FERC reaffirmed the MVP cost allocation on rehearing.
 
Effective January 1, 2012 the FERC authorized OTP to recover 100% of prudently incurred CWIP and Abandoned Plant Recovery on two projects approved by MISO as MVPs in MISO’s 2011 Transmission Expansion Plan: the Big Stone South–Brookings MVP and the Big Stone South–Ellendale MVP.
 
On November 12, 2013 a group of industrial customers and other stakeholders filed a complaint with the FERC seeking to reduce the ROE component of the transmission rates that MISO transmission owners, including OTP, may collect under the MISO Tariff. The complainants sought to reduce the 12.38% ROE used in MISO’s transmission rates to a proposed 9.15%. The complaint established a 15-month refund period from November 12, 2013 to February 11, 2015. On October 16, 2014 the FERC issued an order finding that the current MISO ROE may be unjust and unreasonable and setting the issue for hearing. Parties, including OTP, sought rehearing of the FERC’s decision to set the November 12, 2013 complaint for hearing. This rehearing was denied on July 21, 2016. On September 19, 2016 the MISO transmission owners sought appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit). A non-binding decision by the presiding ALJ was issued on December 22, 2015 finding that the MISO transmission owners’ ROE should be 10.32%, and the FERC issued an order on September 28, 2016 setting the base ROE at 10.32%.
 
On November 6, 2014 a group of MISO transmission owners, including OTP, filed for a FERC incentive of an additional 50-basis points for Regional Transmission Organization participation (RTO Adder). On January 5, 2015 the FERC granted the request, deferring collection of the RTO Adder until the FERC issued its order in the ROE complaint proceeding. Based on the FERC adjustment to the MISO Tariff ROE resulting from the November 12, 2013 complaint and OTP’s incentive rate filing, OTP’s ROE will be 10.82% (a 10.32% base ROE plus the 0.5% RTO Adder) effective September 28, 2016.
 
On February 12, 2015 another group of stakeholders filed a complaint with the FERC seeking to reduce the ROE component of the transmission rates that MISO transmission owners, including OTP, may collect under the MISO Tariff from 12.38% to a proposed 8.67%. This second complaint established a second 15-month refund period from February 12, 2015 to May 11, 2016. The FERC issued an order on June 18, 2015 setting the complaint for hearings before an ALJ, which were held the week of February 16, 2016. Parties, including OTP, sought rehearing of the FERC’s decision to set the November 12, 2013 complaint for hearing. This rehearing was denied on July 21, 2016. On September 19, 2016 the MISO transmission owners sought appeal to the D.C. Circuit. A non-binding decision by the presiding ALJ was issued on June 30, 2016 finding that the MISO transmission owners’ ROE should be 9.7%. The FERC is expected to issue its order not earlier than spring 2017.
 
Based on a potential reduction by the FERC in the ROE component of the MISO Tariff, OTP recorded reductions in revenue of $1.6 million in 2016 and $1.1 million in 2015 and has a $2.7 million liability on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, representing OTP’s best estimate of the refund obligations that would arise, net of amounts that would be subject to recovery under state jurisdictional TCR riders, based on a reduced ROE.
 
Together with as many as 200 utilities, generators and power marketers, OTP participated in proceedings before the FERC regarding the calculation, assessment and implementation of MISO Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges for entities participating in the MISO wholesale energy market since that market’s start on April 1, 2005 until the conclusion of the proceedings on May 2, 2015. The proceedings fundamentally concerned MISO’s application of its MISO RSG rate on file with FERC to market participants, revisions to the RSG rate based on several FERC orders and FERC’s decision to resettle the markets based on MISO application of the RSG rate to market participants. Several of the FERC’s orders are on review in a set of consolidated cases before the D.C. Circuit. The consolidated petitions at the D.C. Circuit involve multiple petitioners and intervenors. These consolidated cases are currently held in abeyance while the parties engage in mediation before the D.C. Circuit. OTP is an intervenor in these cases and a participant in mediation. The scope of the issues that will be subject to appeal at the D.C. Circuit have not yet been finalized. In addition, MISO has not made available past billing or resettlement data necessary for determining amounts that might be payable if the FERC’s decisions are reversed. Therefore, the Company cannot estimate OTP’s exposure at this time from a final order reversing the relevant FERC orders. Although the Company cannot estimate OTP’s exposure at this time, a final order reversing the relevant FERC orders could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.

NAEMA has over 150 members with operations in 48 states and Canada. Power pool sales are conducted continuously through NAEMA in accordance with schedules filed by NAEMA with the FERC.
North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)
 
NERC is an international regulatory authority, subject to oversight by the FERC and governmental authorities in Canada, whose mission is to assure the reliability of the bulk power system in North America. As an owner and operator within the bulk power system, OTP is required to comply with NERC reliability standards, including standards on cybersecurity and protection of critical infrastructure. The FERC approved NERC’s critical infrastructure and protection standards in November 2014.
Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO)
 
OTP is a member of the MRO. The MRO is a non-profit organization dedicated to ensuring the reliability and security of the bulk power system in the north central region of North America, including parts of both the United States and Canada. MRO began operations in 2005 and is one of eight regional entities in North America operating under authority from regulators in the United States and Canada through a delegation agreement with the NERC. The MRO is responsible for: (1) developing and implementing reliability standards, (2) enforcing compliance with those standards, (3) providing seasonal and long-term assessments of the bulk power system’s ability to meet demand for electricity, and (4) providing an appeals and dispute resolution process.
 
The MRO region covers roughly one million square miles spanning the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, the states of North Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska and the majority of the territory in the states of South Dakota, Iowa and Wisconsin. The region includes more than 130 organizations that are involved in the production and delivery of power to more than 20 million people. These organizations include municipal utilities, cooperatives, investor-owned utilities, a federal power marketing agency, Canadian Crown Corporations, independent power producers and others who have interests in the reliability of the bulk power system.
 
To ensure our compliance with NERC standards, the MRO periodically audits OTP. OTP’s most recent audit began with a notification in October 2015 and MRO audit staff conducted fieldwork in January 2016. On January 23, 2017 OTP received its draft audit report from the MRO audit team. Based on the results of their fieldwork and subsequent discussions with OTP, the MRO found no potential violations at OTP.
 
MISO
 
OTP is a member of the MISO. As the transmission provider and security coordinator for the region, the MISO seeks to optimize the efficiency of the interconnected system, provide regional solutions to regional planning needs and minimize risk to reliability through its security coordination, long-term regional planning, market monitoring, scheduling and tariff administration functions. The MISO covers a broad region containing all or parts of 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba. The MISO has operational control of OTP’s transmission facilities above 100 kV, but OTP continues to own and maintain its transmission assets.
 
Through the MISO Energy Markets, MISO seeks to develop options for energy supply, increase utilization of transmission assets, optimize the use of energy resources across a wider region and provide greater visibility of data. MISO aims to facilitate a more cost-effective and efficient use of the wholesale bulk electric system.

Competition, Deregulation and Legislation
 
Electric sales are subject to competition in some areas from municipally owned systems, rural electric cooperatives and, in certain respects, from on-site generators and cogenerators. Electricity also competes with other forms of energy. The degree of competition may vary from time to time depending on relative costs and supplies of other forms of energy.
 
The Company believes OTP is well positioned to be successful in a competitive environment. A comparison of OTP’s electric retail rates to the rates of other investor-owned utilities, cooperatives and municipals in the states OTP serves indicates OTP’s rates are competitive.
 
Legislative and regulatory activity could affect operations in the future. OTP cannot predict the timing or substance of any future legislation or regulation. The Company does not expect retail competition to come to the states of Minnesota, North Dakota or South Dakota in the foreseeable future. There has been no legislative action regarding electric retail choice in any of the states where OTP operates. The Minnesota legislature has in the past considered legislation that, if passed, would have limited the Company’s ability to maintain and grow its nonelectric businesses.
 
OTP is unable to predict the impact on its operations resulting from future regulatory activities, from future legislation or from future taxes that may be imposed on the source or use of energy.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
Impact of Environmental Laws—OTP’s existing generating plants are subject to stringent federal and state standards and regulations regarding, among other things, air, water and solid waste pollution. In the five years ended December 31, 2016 OTP invested approximately $210 million in environmental control facilities. The 2017 and 2018 construction budgets include approximately $6 million and $5 million, respectively, for environmental equipment for existing facilities.
Air Quality - Criteria Pollutants—Pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA), the EPA has promulgated national primary and secondary standards for certain air pollutants.
 
The primary fuels burned by OTP’s steam generating plants are North Dakota lignite coal and western subbituminous coal. Electrostatic precipitators have been installed at the principal units at the Hoot Lake Plant. The Hoot Lake Plant is currently operating within all presently applicable federal and state air quality and emission standards.
 
The South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) issued a Title V Operating Permit to the Big Stone Plant on June 9, 2009, allowing for operation. The Big Stone Plant continues to operate under Title V permit provisions. The Big Stone Plant is currently operating within all presently applicable federal and state air quality and emission standards.
 
The Coyote Station is equipped with sulfur dioxide (SO2) removal equipment. The removal equipment—referred to as a dry scrubber—consists of a spray dryer, followed by a fabric filter, and is designed to desulfurize hot gases from the stack. The fabric filter collects spray dryer residue along with the fly ash. The Coyote Station is currently operating within all presently applicable federal and state air quality and emission standards.
 
The CAA, in addressing acid deposition, imposed requirements on power plants in an effort to reduce national emissions of SO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOx).
 
The national Acid Rain Program SO2 emission reduction goals are achieved through a market based system under which power plants are allocated "emissions allowances" that require plants to either reduce their SO2 emissions or acquire allowances from others to achieve compliance. Each allowance is an authorization to emit one ton of SO2. SO2 emission requirements are currently being met by all of OTP’s generating facilities without the need to acquire additional allowances for compliance with the acid deposition provisions of the CAA.
 
The national Acid Rain Program NOx emission reduction goals are achieved by imposing mandatory emissions standards on individual sources. All of OTP’s generating facilities met the NOx standards during 2016.
 
The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) requires SO2 and NOx emission reductions in primarily eastern states in order to allow downwind states to achieve national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). CSAPR's Phase 1 emission budgets began on January 1, 2015 for the annual SO2 and NOx programs, with stricter Phase 2 budgets beginning in 2017.

The CSAPR rule applies to OTP’s Solway gas peaking plant and the Hoot Lake coal-fired plant in Minnesota. Hoot Lake Plant may be required to purchase SO2 allowances to continue operating at historical levels. Minnesota is considered a Group 2 state for SO2 compliance. Any SO2 allowances that need to be obtained for Hoot Lake Plant will need to be from an entity in a Group 2 state. However, due to reduced dispatch of Hoot Lake Plant in 2016 and early 2017 due to power market conditions, and a decline in Group 2 SO2 allowance prices throughout 2016, the impact of the CSAPR rule is anticipated to be minimal.
 
On September 7, 2016 the EPA finalized an update to the CSAPR to address interstate emission transport with respect to the more recent 2008 ozone NAAQS. The updated CSAPR does not apply to Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota.
 
On October 1, 2015 the EPA announced that it tightened the primary and secondary NAAQS for ozone from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb. This was at the upper end of the range of which the EPA had proposed, which was 65 to 70 ppb. As set forth in the rule, EPA requested that states submit their initial ozone designation recommendations no later than October 1, 2016. All of the states in which OTP operates recommended that they be designated as attainment. EPA will review these recommendations, along with 2014-2016 air quality data, to make final determinations of whether areas are in attainment with the new standard by October 1, 2017. Nonattainment areas are required to meet the standard in the 2020 to 2037 timeframe, with deadlines depending on the severity of an area's ozone problem. Several parties filed petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit challenging the rule and litigation is now pending.
 
In June 2010, the EPA established a new primary NAAQS for SO2 at a level of 75 ppb on a 1-hour average. Designations for this standard are proceeding under several different pathways. For certain large sources as defined by 2012 emissions, including Big Stone Plant and Coyote Station, the EPA entered into a consent decree with the Sierra Club/Natural Resources Defense Council that required the EPA to promulgate final designations near those sources by July 2, 2016. On June 30, 2016, the EPA signed a final rule that designated the areas around Big Stone Plant and Coyote Station as being in attainment/unclassifiable with the 1-hour SO2 NAAQS. Numerous other sources, including Hoot Lake Plant, are covered by the EPA's final Data Requirements Rule (DRR) that was finalized in August 2015. The DRR requires states to provide either modeling or monitoring data to adequately characterize SO2 emissions surrounding those sources. Based on modeling, in January 2017, the state of Minnesota recommended to the EPA that the area surrounding Hoot Lake Plant be designated as attainment. The EPA will evaluate the state submittals, and it is anticipated that the EPA will issue final designations for the DRR by the end of 2017.
 
Air Quality – Hazardous Air Pollutants—On December 16, 2011 the EPA signed a final rule to reduce mercury and other air toxics emissions from power plants known as the MATS rule. The final rule became effective on April 16, 2012, and plants had until April 16, 2015 to comply. However, the EPA encouraged state permitting authorities to broadly grant a one-year compliance extension to plants that need additional time to install controls. With the installation of new pollution control equipment in 2015, OTP's affected units are meeting current requirements. Emissions monitoring equipment and/or stack testing is being used to verify compliance with the standards. Litigation surrounding the MATS rule is ongoing despite the expiration of the compliance deadlines, and the rule remains in effect while the litigation continues. On April 15, 2016 the EPA issued a supplemental finding that the MATS rule continues to be “appropriate and necessary” when considering the costs of compliance. This finding is being challenged by several parties.
Air Quality – EPA New Source Review Enforcement Initiative—In 1998 the EPA announced its New Source Review Enforcement Initiative targeting coal-fired power plants, petroleum refineries, pulp and paper mills and other industries for alleged violations of the EPA’s New Source Review rules. These rules require owners or operators that construct new major sources or make major modifications to existing sources to obtain permits and install air pollution control equipment at affected facilities. Pursuant to the Initiative, the EPA has attempted to determine if emission sources violated certain provisions of the CAA by making major modifications to their facilities without installing state-of-the-art pollution controls. OTP has not received any recent requests from the EPA, pursuant to Section 114(a) of the CAA, to provide information relative to past operation and capital construction projects at its coal-fired plants.
 
Air Quality – Regional Haze Program—The EPA promulgated the Regional Haze Rule in 1999, and on June 15, 2005 the EPA provided final guidelines for conducting Best-Available Retrofit Technology (BART) determinations under the rule. The Regional Haze Rule requires emissions reductions from BART-eligible sources that are deemed to contribute to visibility impairment in Class I air quality areas. Big Stone Plant is BART eligible, and the South Dakota DENR determined that the plant is subject to emission reduction requirements based on the modeled contribution of the plant emissions to visibility impairment in downwind Class I air quality areas. Based on the South Dakota DENR's BART determination and the final South Dakota Regional Haze State Implementation Plan (SIP) approved by the EPA on March 29, 2012, Big Stone Plant was required to install Selective Catalytic Reduction and separated over-fire air to reduce NOx emissions, dry flue gas desulfurization to reduce SO2 emissions, and a new baghouse for particulate matter control. The Big Stone Plant BART compliant AQCS equipment was placed into commercial operation on December 29, 2015.

The North Dakota Regional Haze SIP requires that Coyote Station reduce its NOx emissions to 0.5 pounds per million Btu as calculated on a 30-day rolling average basis beginning on July 1, 2018. The control equipment was installed during a spring 2016 outage, and tuning of the equipment is ongoing.
 
Air Quality – Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Regulation—Combustion of fossil fuels for the generation of electricity is a considerable stationary source of CO2 emissions in the United States and globally. OTP is an owner or part-owner of three baseload, coal-fired electricity generating plants and three fuel-oil or natural gas-fired combustion turbine peaking plants with a combined net dependable capacity of 650 MW. In 2016 these plants emitted approximately 2.7 million tons of CO2.
 
In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that determined that the EPA has authority to regulate CO2 and other GHGs from automobiles as “air pollutants” under the CAA. The EPA thereafter conducted a rulemaking to determine whether GHG emissions contribute to climate change “which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” While this case addressed a provision of the CAA related to emissions from motor vehicles, a parallel provision of the CAA applies to stationary sources such as electric generators. The EPA determined that parallel provision would be automatically triggered once the EPA began regulating motor vehicle GHG emissions. The first step in the EPA rulemaking process was the publication of an endangerment finding in the December 15, 2009 Federal Register where the EPA found that CO2 and five other GHGs – methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride – threaten public health and the environment.
 
The EPA’s endangerment finding for GHGs did not in and of itself impose any emission reduction requirements but rather authorized the EPA to finalize the GHG standards for new light-duty vehicles as part of the joint rulemaking with the Department of Transportation. These standards applied to motor vehicles as of January 2011, which the EPA determined made GHGs “subject to regulation” under the CAA. According to the EPA, this triggered the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V operating permits programs for stationary sources of GHGs.
 
On June 6, 2010 the EPA published a final “tailoring rule” that phased in application of its PSD and Title V programs to GHG emission sources, including power plants. The PSD program applies to existing sources if there is a physical change or change in the method of operation of the facility that results in a significant net emissions increase of any pollutant. As a result, PSD does not apply on a set timeline as is the case with other regulatory programs, but is triggered when certain activities take place at a major source. If triggered, the owner or operator of an affected facility must undergo a review which requires, among other things, the identification and implementation of best-available control technology (BACT) for the regulated air pollutants for which there is a significant net emissions increase, and an analysis of the ambient air quality impacts of the facility.
 
In June 2012 the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld most of the EPA’s rules regarding the regulation of GHGs under the CAA, including the tailoring rule. However, in October 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the question of whether the regulation of new motor vehicle GHG emissions does in fact automatically trigger PSD and Title V regulation of GHGs for stationary sources. On June 23, 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision that, in summary, held the EPA exceeded its statutory authority and may not require a PSD or Title V permit based solely on GHG emissions. However, the U.S. Supreme Court also said the EPA could continue to require that PSD permits for sources otherwise subject to PSD based on emissions of conventional pollutants contain limitations on GHG emissions based on the application of BACT. The EPA revised its regulations to implement this ruling and in 2016 proposed a de minimis level of GHG emissions below which PSD would not apply. OTP does not anticipate making modifications that would trigger PSD requirements at any of its facilities or undertaking construction of a new unit that might trigger PSD.
 
The EPA has developed New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for GHGs from new and existing fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. On October 23, 2015 the EPA published the final NSPS under section 111(b) of the CAA that requires certain new units (as well as modified and reconstructed units) to meet CO2 emission standards. New natural gas combustion turbines are required to meet a standard of 1,000 lbs. of CO2 per gross megawatt hour averaged over a 12-month period if they meet the definition of a baseload unit. New natural gas combined cycle units are anticipated to fit into this category. Simple cycle combustion turbines are regulated in a non-baseload category that is required to meet a heat input based standard that can be met by burning clean fuels such as natural gas. This rule was challenged by a number of parties and litigation is pending.
 
The EPA also published GHG performance standards for existing sources under CAA Section 111(d) (111(d) Standard). A 111(d) Standard, unlike those set under CAA Section 111(b), applies to existing sources of a pollutant. Under Section 111(d), the EPA promulgates emission guidelines and the states are then given a period of time to develop plans to implement the standard. The EPA reviews each state-developed standard and then approves it if the state’s plan comports with the federal emission guidelines. If the state does not submit a plan or the EPA finds that the plan is inadequate, the EPA will prescribe a plan for that state.

For both new and existing sources, the EPA must develop a “standard of performance,” which is defined as:
 
…a standard for emissions of air pollutants which reflects the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction and any non-air quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements) the [EPA] Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated.
 
For existing sources, Section 111(d) also requires the EPA to consider, “among other factors, remaining useful lives of the sources in the category of sources to which such standard applies.”
 
On June 18, 2014 the EPA published proposed Section 111(d) emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel-fired power plants, termed the Clean Power Plan (CPP). The CPP proposed state-specific rate-based goals for CO2 emissions from the power sector, as well as guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to achieve the goals. An interim goal was proposed to be achieved on average over the ten year period of 2020-2029, and a final goal in 2030 and each year thereafter. The EPA used a formula that relies on four building blocks to determine the state-specific goal: (1) a six percent heat rate improvement at each coal plant, (2) increased reliance on natural gas combined cycle units, (3) a renewable energy target, and (4) demand side energy efficiency savings. Specific to OTP, EPA's proposed formula created substantially different targets for North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota, primarily due to the EPA's second building block that envisioned redispatching natural gas combined cycle units to a 70% capacity factor.
 
On October 23, 2015 the EPA published the final CPP. The final rule delayed the start of the interim goal period to 2022 and used a different formula to calculate state goals that resulted in a narrower range of state-specific targets. The EPA formula relied on only three building blocks in the final rule: (1) a heat rate improvement at each coal plant, (2) increased reliance on natural gas combined cycle units, and (3) increased deployment of renewable energy. These building blocks were applied to each grid interconnection that resulted in final national uniform emission rate standards of 1,305 pounds of CO2 per net megawatt hour for coal plants and 771 pounds of CO2 per net megawatt hour for natural gas combined cycle plants. These uniform rates were applied on a weighted average basis to the affected units of each state, resulting in a much narrower range of goals in the final rule as compared to the proposed rule. The EPA then translated the rate goals into mass-based goals that can be applied to existing sources or, if a state chooses, a mass-based goal that applies to both existing sources and new sources.
 
A number of states, utilities, and trade groups filed petitions for review with the D.C. Circuit seeking to overturn the rule, and also moved to stay the rule. On January 14, 2016 the D.C. Circuit denied the stay motions. Numerous petitioners then sought an emergency stay in the U.S. Supreme Court. On February 9, 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the rule pending disposition of petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit and, if a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court were granted, any final Supreme Court determination. The D.C. Circuit heard oral argument on challenges to the CO2 emission guidelines on September 27, 2016 before the full court, and a decision is likely to be rendered in the first half of 2017. In addition, members of Congress and the new administration have been very critical of the CPP and may take actions that could impact the rule or the litigation. Therefore, while the CPP remains stayed, there is uncertainty regarding the future of the rule.
 
Also on October 23, 2015 the EPA proposed model trading rules along with the proposed federal plan for states that do not have a fully approved state plan. The EPA proposed both a rate-based trading plan and a mass-based trading plan for the federal plan. On December 19, 2016 the EPA withdrew the model trading rules and federal plan from the interagency review process and instead released the model trading rules as a working draft. The draft does not reflect final agency action or official statement of policy, and does not create any legal obligations. The docket for these items will remain open so that the EPA can potentially finalize the work in the future should the CPP, or a similar rule, be implemented.
 
Several states and regional organizations have or will develop state-specific or regional legislative initiatives to reduce GHG emissions through mandatory programs. In 2007 the state of Minnesota passed legislation regarding renewable energy portfolio standards that requires retail electricity providers to obtain 25% of the electric energy sold to Minnesota customers from renewable sources by the year 2025. Additionally, in 2013 the state of Minnesota passed a provision that requires public utilities to generate or procure sufficient electricity generated by solar energy to serve its retail electricity customers in Minnesota so that by the end of 2020, at least 1.5% of the utility's total retail electric sales to retail customers in Minnesota is generated by solar energy. The Minnesota legislature set a January 1, 2008 deadline for the MPUC to establish an estimate of the likely range of costs of future CO2 regulation on electricity generation. The legislation also set state targets for reducing fossil fuel use, included goals for reducing the state's output of GHGs, and restricted importing electricity that would contribute to statewide power sector CO2 emission. The MPUC, in its order dated December 21, 2007, established an estimate of future CO2 regulation costs at between $4/ton and $30/ton emitted in 2012 and after. Annual updates of the range are required. For 2016 the range is $9-$34/ton, and the applicable effective date to begin using CO2 costs in resource planning decisions is 2022. Minnesota opened a new docket to investigate the environmental and socioeconomic costs of externalities associated with electricity generation. A final ruling in that case is not expected until the second quarter of 2017.

The states of North Dakota and South Dakota currently have no proposed or pending legislation related to the regulation of GHG emissions, but North Dakota and South Dakota have 10% renewable energy objectives. OTP currently has sufficient renewable generation to meet the renewable energy objectives in both North Dakota and South Dakota.
 
While the eventual outcome of GHG regulation is unknown, OTP is taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint and mitigate levels of CO2 emitted in the process of generating electricity for its customers through the following initiatives:
 

· | Supply efficiency and reliability: Since 2005, SO2 and NOx emitted from OTP’s fossil fuel-fired plants have decreased 50% and 62%, respectively. OTP’s efforts to increase plant efficiency and add renewable energy to its resource mix have reduced its CO2 intensity. Between 2005 and 2015 OTP decreased its overall system average CO2 emissions intensity by approximately 30%. With recent installations of pollution control equipment, OTP expects to achieve reductions of mercury emissions of more than 70% between 2005 and 2016. Further reductions are expected with the anticipated replacement of Hoot Lake Plant generation with natural gas-fired generation in the 2021 timeframe. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Conservation: Since 1992 OTP has helped its customers conserve more than 3.1 million cumulative megawatt-hours of electricity, which is roughly equivalent to the amount of electricity that 258,000 average homes would use in a year and represents approximately 250% of the annual energy sales of OTP’s entire residential customer base. Additionally, OTP’s conservation programs contribute 71 MW of load reduction to its system. 
· | Renewable energy: Since 2002, OTP’s customers have been able to purchase 100% of their electricity from wind generation through OTP’s Tail Winds program. OTP has access to 102.9 MW of wind powered generation under power purchase agreements and owns 138 MW of wind powered generation. OTP is exploring options for meeting a Minnesota legislative mandate requiring Minnesota’s investor-owned utilities to serve 1.5% of their Minnesota retail electric sales with solar power by 2020. 
· | Other: OTP is a participating member of the EPA’s sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) Emission Reduction Partnership for Electric Power Systems program, which proactively is targeting a reduction in emissions of SF6, a potent GHG. SF6 has a global-warming potential 23,900 times that of CO2. OTP participates in carbon sequestration research through the Plains CO2 Reduction (PCOR) Partnership through the University of North Dakota’s Energy and Environmental Research Center. The PCOR Partnership is a collaborative effort of approximately 100 public and private sector stakeholders working toward a better understanding of the technical and economic feasibility of capturing and storing anthropogenic CO2 emissions from stationary sources in central North America.

 
While the future financial impact of any proposed or pending litigation or regulation of GHG emissions is unknown at this time, any capital and operating costs incurred for additional pollution control equipment or CO2 emission reduction measures, such as the cost of sequestration or purchasing allowances, or offset credits, or the imposition of a carbon tax or cap and trade program at the state or federal level could materially adversely affect the Company’s future results of operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition, unless such costs could be recovered through regulated rates and/or future market prices for energy.
 
Water Quality—The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and amendments thereto, provide for, among other things, the imposition of effluent limitations to regulate discharges of pollutants, including thermal discharges, into the waters of the United States, and the EPA has established effluent guidelines for the steam electric power generating industry. Discharges must also comply with state water quality standards.
 
Effluent limits specific to Hoot Lake Plant and Coyote Station are incorporated into their National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. Big Stone Plant is a zero discharge facility and therefore does not have a NPDES permit. On November 3, 2015 the EPA published the final rule that sets technology-based effluent limitations on certain types of discharges. Generally, the final rule establishes new requirements for wastewater streams from wet flue gas desulfurization, fly ash transport, and bottom ash transport. This includes zero discharge requirements for fly ash and bottom ash transport water. OTP’s facilities either utilize dry ash handling or use transport water in a closed loop manner. Therefore, OTP anticipates minimal impact from the rule.
 
On May 9, 2014 the EPA Administrator signed a final rule implementing Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act establishing standards for cooling water intake structures for certain existing facilities. The final rule includes seven compliance options, plus a potential "de minimis" option that is not well defined. Although the impact of the Hoot Lake Plant intake structure has been extensively evaluated in two separate studies both of which showed minimal impact, OTP will need to have state agency discussions during the renewal of the Hoot Lake Plant NPDES permit to determine the appropriate path forward. Coyote Station will also need to provide various studies with their next NPDES permit renewal application, but minimal impact is anticipated since Coyote Station already uses closed-cycle cooling. Litigation over the final rule remains pending.

OTP has all federal and state water permits presently necessary for the operation of the Coyote Station, the Big Stone Plant and the Hoot Lake Plant.
 
OTP owns five small dams on the Otter Tail River, which are subject to FERC licensing requirements. A license for all five dams was issued on December 5, 1991. In June 2015 OTP notified the FERC of its intent to relicense these dams. The current FERC license expires in 2021 and the licensing process takes approximately 5 years. The FERC completed the scoping meeting in the fall of 2016. OTP is currently in the process of finalizing the study plan. The studies will be completed in 2017 and 2018. These studies will be followed by the filing of the license application in 2019. OTP expects FERC to issue an order on the license application in 2021. Total nameplate rating (manufacturer’s expected output) of the five dams is 3,450 kW.
 
Solid Waste—Permits for disposal of ash and other solid wastes have been issued for the Coyote Station, the Big Stone Plant and the Hoot Lake Plant.
 
On December 19, 2014 the EPA announced a final rule regulating coal combustion residuals (CCR) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulating the disposal of coal ash generated from the combustion of coal by electric utilities under Subtitle D’s nonhazardous provisions. The final rule was published on April 17, 2015. The rule requires OTP to complete certain actions, such as installing additional groundwater monitoring wells and investigating whether existing surface impoundments meet defined location restrictions, in order to determine whether existing surface impoundments should be retired or retrofitted with liners. OTP is still in the process of completing its actions. Therefore, the cost impact of this rule will not be known until those actions are completed. Existing landfill cells can continue to operate as designed, but future expansions will require composite liner and leachate collection systems. On December 20, 2016 the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act was signed into law. The WIIN Act allows states to regulate CCR if the state standards are at least as protective as the EPA CCR Rule.
 
At the request of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), OTP has an ongoing investigation at its former, closed Hoot Lake Plant ash disposal sites. The MPCA continues to monitor site activities under its Voluntary Investigation and Cleanup (VIC) Program. OTP completed projects in 2014 and 2015 that removed the ash from two entire VIC areas and placed it in OTP’s permitted disposal area. Efforts to remove ash from the remaining two VIC areas began in 2016 and will continue through 2017.
 
In 1980 the United States enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or the Federal Superfund law, which was reauthorized and amended in 1986. In 1983 Minnesota adopted the Minnesota Environmental Response and Liability Act, commonly known as the Minnesota Superfund law. In 1988 South Dakota enacted the Regulated Substance Discharges Act, commonly known as the South Dakota Superfund law. In 1989, North Dakota enacted the Environmental Emergency Cost Recovery Act. Among other requirements, the federal and state acts establish environmental response funds to pay for remedial actions associated with the release or threatened release of certain regulated substances into the environment. These federal and state Superfund laws also establish liability for cleanup costs and damage to the environment resulting from such release or threatened release of regulated substances. The Minnesota Superfund law also creates liability for personal injury and economic loss under certain circumstances. OTP has not incurred any significant costs to date related to these laws. OTP is not presently named as a potentially responsible party under the federal or state Superfund laws.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
OTP is continually expanding, replacing and improving its electric facilities. During 2016 approximately $150 million in cash was invested for additions and replacements to its electric utility properties. During the five years ended December 31, 2016 gross electric property additions, including construction work in progress, were approximately $677 million and gross retirements were approximately $89 million. OTP estimates that during the five-year period 2017-2021 it will invest approximately $862 million for electric construction, which includes $315 million for renewable wind and solar energy generation projects, $147 million for natural gas-fired generation to replace Hoot Lake Plant capacity and $116 million for MVP transmission projects. The remainder of the 2017-2021 anticipated capital expenditures is for asset replacements, additions and improvements across OTP’s generation, transmission, distribution and general plant. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Requirements” section for further discussion.
 
The $315 million planned investment for renewable wind and solar energy generation projects includes the Merricourt Wind Project. In November 2016 OTP signed agreements to purchase this 150-MW wind farm in southeastern North Dakota that EDF Renewable Energy will design and build in 2019.

MANUFACTURING
 
General
 
Manufacturing consists of businesses engaged in the following activities: contract machining, metal parts stamping, fabrication and painting, and production of material handling trays and horticultural containers.
 
The Company derived 28%, 28% and 27% of its consolidated operating revenues and 11%, 9% and 17% of its consolidated operating income from the Manufacturing segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Following is a brief description of each of these businesses:
 
BTD Manufacturing, Inc. (BTD), with headquarters located in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, is a metal stamping and tool and die manufacturer that provides its services mainly to customers in the Midwest. BTD stamps, fabricates, welds, paints and laser cuts metal components according to manufacturers’ specifications primarily for the recreational vehicle, agricultural, oil and gas, lawn and garden, industrial equipment, health and fitness and enclosure industries in its facilities in Detroit Lakes and Lakeville, Minnesota, Washington, Illinois and Dawsonville, Georgia.

Plastics’ Otsego thermoforming facility has an AIB International compliance rating for producing food-contact packaging materials in its operations.
 
Product Distribution
 
The principal method for distribution of the manufacturing companies’ products is by direct shipment to the customer by common carrier ground transportation. No single customer or product of the Company’s manufacturing companies account for over 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenue.
Competition
 
The various markets in which the Manufacturing segment entities compete are characterized by intense competition from both foreign and domestic manufacturers. These markets have many established manufacturers with broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, greater capital resources, excess capacity, labor advantages and larger marketing, research and development staffs and facilities than the Company’s manufacturing entities.

The Company believes the principal competitive factors in its Manufacturing segment are product performance, quality, price, technical innovation, cost effectiveness, customer service and breadth of product line. The Company’s manufacturing entities intend to continue to compete on the basis of high-performance products, innovative production technologies, cost-effective manufacturing techniques, close customer relations and support, and increasing product offerings.
 
Raw Materials Supply
 
The companies in the Manufacturing segment use raw materials in the products they manufacture, including steel, aluminum and polystyrene and other plastics resins. Both pricing increases and availability of these raw materials are concerns of companies in the Manufacturing segment. The companies in the Manufacturing segment attempt to pass increases in the costs of these raw materials on to their customers. Increases in the costs of raw materials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a negative effect on profit margins in the Manufacturing segment. Additionally, a certain amount of residual material (scrap) is a by-product of many of the manufacturing and production processes used by the Company’s manufacturing companies. Declines in commodity prices for these scrap materials due to weakened demand or excess supply can negatively impact the profitability of the Company’s manufacturing companies as it reduces their ability to mitigate the cost associated with excess material.
Backlog
 
The Manufacturing segment has backlog in place to support 2017 revenues of approximately $118 million compared with $134 million one year ago.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
Capital expenditures in the Manufacturing segment typically include additional investments in new manufacturing equipment or expenditures to replace worn-out manufacturing equipment. Capital expenditures may also be made for the purchase of land and buildings for plant expansion and for investments in management information systems. During 2016, cash expenditures for capital additions in the Manufacturing segment were approximately $8 million. Total capital expenditures for the Manufacturing segment during the five-year period 2017-2021 are estimated to be approximately $54 million.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2016 the Manufacturing segment had 1,175 full-time employees. There were 1,037 full-time employees at BTD and its subsidiaries and 138 full-time employees at T.O. Plastics as of December 31, 2016.
PLASTICS
 
General
 
Plastics consists of businesses producing PVC pipe at plants in North Dakota and Arizona. The Company derived 19%, 20% and 22% of its consolidated operating revenues and 16%, 19% and 20% of its consolidated operating income from the Plastics segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Following is a brief description of these businesses:
Northern Pipe Products, Inc. (Northern Pipe), located in Fargo, North Dakota, manufactures and sells PVC pipe for municipal water, rural water, wastewater, storm drainage systems and other uses in the northern, midwestern, south-central and western regions of the United States as well as central and western Canada.
Vinyltech Corporation (Vinyltech), located in Phoenix, Arizona, manufactures and sells PVC pipe for municipal water, wastewater, water reclamation systems and other uses in the western, northwestern and south-central regions of the United States.
 
Together these companies have the current capacity to produce approximately 300 million pounds of PVC pipe annually.
 
Customers
 
PVC pipe products are marketed through a combination of independent sales representatives, company salespersons and customer service representatives. Customers for the PVC pipe products consist primarily of wholesalers and distributors throughout the northern, midwestern, south-central, western and northwest United States. The principal method for distribution of the PVC pipe companies’ products is by common carrier ground transportation. No single customer of the PVC pipe companies accounts for over 10% of the Company’s consolidated revenue.

Competition
 
The plastic pipe industry is fragmented and competitive, due to the number of producers, the small number of raw material suppliers and the fungible nature of the product. Due to shipping costs, competition is usually regional, instead of national, in scope. The principal factors of competition are price, service, warranty, and product performance. Northern Pipe and Vinyltech compete not only against other plastic pipe manufacturers, but also ductile iron, steel and concrete pipe producers. Pricing pressure will continue to affect our Plastics segment operating margins in the future.
 
Northern Pipe and Vinyltech intend to continue to compete on the basis of their high quality products, cost-effective production techniques and close customer relations and support.
 
Manufacturing and Resin Supply
 
PVC pipe is manufactured through a process known as extrusion. During the production process, PVC compound (a dry powder-like substance) is introduced into an extrusion machine, where it is heated to a molten state and then forced through a sizing apparatus to produce the pipe. The newly extruded pipe is then pulled through a series of water cooling tanks, marked to identify the type of pipe and cut to finished lengths. Warehouse and outdoor storage facilities are used to store the finished product. Inventory is shipped from storage to distributors and customers by common carrier.
 
The PVC resins are acquired in bulk and shipped to point of use by rail car. There are four vendors that Northern Pipe and Vinyltech can source to supply their PVC resin requirements. Two vendors provided 100% and 96% of total resin purchases in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The supply of PVC resin may also be limited primarily due to manufacturing capacity and the limited availability of raw material components. A majority of U.S. resin production plants are located in the Gulf Coast region, which is subject to risk of damage to the plants and potential shutdown of resin production because of exposure to hurricanes that occur in that part of the United States. The loss of a key vendor, or any interruption or delay in the supply of PVC resin, could disrupt the ability of the Plastics segment to manufacture products, cause customers to cancel orders or require incurrence of additional expenses to obtain PVC resin from alternative sources, if such sources were available. Both Northern Pipe and Vinyltech believe they have good relationships with their key raw material vendors.
 
Due to the commodity nature of PVC resin and PVC pipe and the dynamic supply and demand factors worldwide, historically the markets for both PVC resin and PVC pipe have been very cyclical with significant fluctuations in prices and gross margins.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
Capital expenditures in the Plastics segment typically include investments in extrusion machines and support equipment. During 2016, cash expenditures for capital additions in the Plastics segment were approximately $3 million. Total capital expenditures for the five-year period 2017-2021 are estimated to be approximately $20 million to replace existing equipment.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2016 the Plastics segment had 156 full-time employees. Northern Pipe had 90 full-time employees and Vinyltech had 66 full-time employees as of December 31, 2016.
