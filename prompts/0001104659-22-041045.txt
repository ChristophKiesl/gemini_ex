--------+----------

General
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on July 1, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination. We have not selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or sector, we intend to focus our efforts on identifying businesses in the FinTech and financial services industries with an equity value of approximately $300 million to $500 million.
 
FinTech is in the beginning stages of transforming the global financial and investment business. There has been a rise in the level of sophistication and interconnectivity between innovative technology and financial services providers, and we expect this trend to continue and accelerate. We believe that there are many potential targets within the financial services space that could become attractive public companies. These potential targets exhibit a broad range of business models and financial characteristics that range from very high growth and innovative companies to more mature businesses with established markets, recurring revenues and strong cash flows.
 
We believe that our executives and board have considerable experience, talent and expertise in the global financial services and financial technologies sectors, which collectively will offer us an advantage in searching for and acquiring an attractive company with significant value for our shareholders.
 
Mr. Peel, our interim Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, has extensive international experience in technology markets with a strong focus on software for financial markets. Mr. Peel has run his own advisory firm (Quadriga Consulting Ltd) since January 2002 and has worked with dozens of technology firms on growth, market expansion and channel development. Mr. Peel is joined by Mr. Rzepka, our Chief Financial Officer, who has a more than twenty-year corporate career, serving as CFO and finance director in privately held companies as well as local subsidiaries of publicly listed international corporations. Our other directors Stefan Nolte, James Needham and Jamie Khurshid bring extensive experience in international business, investment banking, financial markets, blockchain and digital assets to the table.
 
On December 14, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 10,005,000 public units, which included the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 1,305,000 public units to cover over-allotments, with each public unit consisting of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, $0.0001 par value per share, one redeemable warrant, with each public warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, and one public right, with each public right entitling the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of Class A common stock upon our consummation of an initial business combination. The public units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per public unit, and the Initial Public Offering generated gross proceeds of $100,050,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses).
 
On December 14, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 373,750 representative’s shares, and representative’s warrants to purchase an aggregate of 800,400 shares of common stock, exercisable at $12.00 per share, to I-Bankers in connection with its services as the representative of the underwriters for the Initial Public Offering and as a result of the full exercise of its over-allotment option. I-Bankers has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the representative’s shares without the Company’s prior written consent until the completion of the Company’s initial business combination. In addition, I-Bankers (and/or its designees) has agreed (i) to vote such shares in favor of any proposed business combination, (ii) to waive its redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of the Company’s initial business combination and (iii) to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete its initial business combination within 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination, as described in more detail herein). The representative’s warrants may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, at any time during the period commencing on the later of the first anniversary of the effective date of the Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-260434) and the closing of the Company’s initial business combination and terminating on the fifth anniversary of the commencement of sales in the Initial Public Offering.

The representative’s warrants grant to holders certain demand and “piggy-back” registration rights for periods of five and seven years, respectively, from the commencement of sales in the Initial Public Offering with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the representative’s warrants. The representative’s shares, representatives warrants and any shares purchase pursuant to the representative’s warrants have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a period of 180 days immediately following the commencement date of sales in the Initial Public Offering pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1).
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the issuance and sale of the public units, we sold 504,950 private placement units at a price of $10.00 per private placement unit to our co-sponsors, anchor investors and I-Bankers in the Private Placement, generating gross proceeds of $5,049,500. Each private placement unit consists of one private placement share, one redeemable private placement warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, and one private placement right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon the consummation by the Company of an initial business combination. The private placement warrants are substantially similar to the public warrants, except that the private placement warrants, so long as they are held by our co-sponsors, initial stockholders or their permitted transferees, (i) will not be redeemable by us, (ii) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination, (iii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) will be entitled to registration rights.
 
The net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering, together with certain of the proceeds from the Private Placement, $101,050,500 in the aggregate, were placed in the trust account. Except for the withdrawal from interest earned the proceeds in the trust account to fund taxes payable and up to $100,000 to pay dissolution expenses, or upon the redemption by public stockholders of common stock in connection with certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, none of the funds held in the trust account will be released until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or the redemption of 100% of the public shares and issued by the us in the Initial Public Offering if we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within 12 months (or, if extended by resolution of our board of directors, up to 18 months) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering.
 
Business Strategy
 
We currently intend to concentrate our efforts in identifying businesses in the financial services industry with an equity value of approximately $300 million to $500 million or more, with particular emphasis on businesses that are providing or changing technology to exploit growing foreign demand for cutting edge, real-time access to United States financial markets for trading in equities, foreign exchange and futures.
 
Over the past several years, there has been a rise in the level of sophistication and interconnectivity between innovative technology and financial services providers, and we expect this trend to continue and accelerate. We believe that there are many potential targets within the financial services space that could become attractive public companies. These potential targets exhibit a broad range of business models and financial characteristics that range from very high growth innovative companies to more mature businesses with established franchises, recurring revenues and strong cash flows.
 
There has been significant disruption and change in the delivery of financial services in recent years, including, among others:
 

• | Payments processing for consumers and businesses; 
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Wealth management (robo advisors); 
--+---------------------------------------

• | Exchanges and trading platforms;
--+---------------------------------


• | Big data moving to the cloud, APIs, data security; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Digital assets and blockchain technology. 
--+----------------------------------------------

 
With increased adoption of technology solutions by both consumers and businesses, we believe that the sector is poised for continued growth in both overall market size and penetration. Key industry characteristics include long-term organic growth, attractive competitive dynamics and further consolidation opportunities. Key business characteristics include high barriers to entry, low risk of technological obsolescence and public market-ready scale. Key financial metrics include organic revenue growth, recurring revenues and strong cash flow conversion.
 
We do not intend to limit our search to one segment of the financial services ecosystem, but will instead target a wide variety of companies that deliver a solution or product to the financial services end-market. We believe that our extensive experience and demonstrated success in advising and investing in businesses in this industry provides us with a unique set of capabilities that will be utilized in generating stockholder returns.
 
We will seek to acquire established businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial, operational, strategic or managerial improvements to maximize value. We will also look at earlier stage companies that exhibit the potential to change the industries in which they participate and which offer the potential of sustained high levels of revenue growth. Consistent with our industry focus, we intend to target financial services businesses that have strong management teams, demonstrated organic growth, and differentiated products or services. Opportunities range from high-growth, customer facing technologies in payments, lending and digital assets to more mature, high-margin, stable businesses which may be engaged in lending, asset management, or providing critical processing and support to established financial services firms.
 
We believe that the wide networks of our management team and our advisor will deliver access to a broad spectrum of opportunities across the financial services landscape. In addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own, we anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions.
 
The members of our management team and our advisor have begun communicating with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business combination and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potential opportunities.
 
Acquisition Criteria
 
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We expect that no individual criterion will entirely determine a decision to pursue a particular opportunity. We intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe:

• | are fundamentally sound companies that can enhance stockholder value through a combination with us, and offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have strong, experienced management teams, or provide a platform to assemble an effective management team with a track record of driving growth and profitability; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | are at an inflection point, such as requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate through new operational techniques, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | can benefit from the application and exploitation of financial service technologies; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
3

 


• | have a history of, or potential for, strong, stable free cash flow generation, with predictable and recurring revenue streams; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | can grow both organically and where we believe our ability to source proprietary opportunities and execute transactions will help the business grow through additional acquisitions; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have a leading or niche market position and that demonstrate advantages when compared to their competitors, which may help to create barriers to entry against new competitors; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | can benefit from being a publicly traded company, with access to broader capital markets, to achieve the Company’s growth strategy; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe can be enhanced based on our analysis and due diligence review. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management team and advisors may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, would be in the form of proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents that we would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
We may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our initial business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our initial business combination. We intend to acquire a company with an enterprise value significantly above the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement. Depending on the size of the transaction or the number of public shares we become obligated to redeem, we may potentially utilize several additional financing sources, including but not limited to the issuance of additional securities to the sellers of a target business, debt issued by banks or other lenders or the owners of the target, a private placement to raise additional funds, or a combination of the foregoing. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our initial business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient to meet our obligations or our working capital needs, we may need to obtain additional financing.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
 

• | Management Operating and Investing Experience. Our directors and executive officers have significant experience in the financial services and financial technology industries. We believe that this breadth of experience provides us with a competitive advantage in evaluating businesses and acquisition opportunities in our target industry. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Established Deal Sourcing Network. As a result of their extensive experience in the financial services industry, our management team members have developed a broad array of contacts in the industry. We believe that these contacts will be important in generating acquisition opportunities for us. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong Financial Position and Flexibility. With a trust account initially in the amount of $101,050,500 and a public market for our common stock, we offer a target business a variety of options to facilitate a future business transaction and fund the growth and expansion of business operations. Because we are able to consummate an initial business transaction using our capital stock, debt, cash or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to design an acquisition structure to address the needs of the parties. We have not, however, taken any steps to secure third party financing and expect to do so only in connection with the consummation of our initial business transaction. Accordingly, our flexibility in structuring an initial business transaction may be constrained by our ability to arrange third-party financing, if required.

• | Status as a Public Company. We believe our structure will make us an attractive business transaction partner to prospective target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business transaction with us. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. We believe that being a public company can also augment a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid it in attracting and retaining talented employees.

Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% of net assets test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
 
Our Business Combination Process
 
In evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review process that will encompass, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), on-site inspection of facilities and assets (if deemed necessary), discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews and other reviews as we deem appropriate.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our co-sponsors or our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our co-sponsors, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.

Our officers and directors indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement units. Because of this ownership, our co-sponsors and our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
We have not selected any specific business combination target yet. However, we have started discussions with potential targets for a business combination.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will not materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.
 
Our Management Team
 
Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
 
We believe our management team’s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies will provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships in various industries. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. See the section of this Report entitled “
