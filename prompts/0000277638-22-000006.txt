Item 1.  Business.
General
The Davey Tree Expert Company, which was founded in 1880 and incorporated in Ohio in 1909, and its subsidiaries provide a wide range of arboricultural, horticultural, environmental and consulting services to our customers throughout the United States and Canada. We have two reportable operating segments organized by type or class of customer: Residential and Commercial, and Utility.
Our Residential and Commercial segment provides services to our residential and commercial customers including: the treatment, preservation, maintenance, removal and planting of trees, shrubs and other plant life; the practice of landscaping, grounds maintenance, tree surgery, tree feeding and tree spraying; the application of fertilizer, herbicides and insecticides; and natural resource management and consulting, forestry research and development, and environmental planning.
Our Utility segment is principally engaged in providing services to our utility customers--investor-owned, municipal utilities, and rural electric cooperatives--including: the practice of line-clearing and vegetation management around power lines and rights-of-way and chemical brush control, natural resource management and consulting, forestry research and development and environmental planning.
We also maintain research, technical support and laboratory diagnostic facilities.
Competition and Customers
Our Residential and Commercial segment is one of the largest national tree care organizations in the United States, and competes with other national and local firms with respect to its services. On a national level, our competition is primarily landscape construction and maintenance companies as well as residential and commercial lawn care companies. At a local and regional level, our competition comes mainly from small, local companies which are engaged primarily in tree care and lawn services. Our Utility segment is the second largest organization in the industry in the United States, and competes principally with one major national competitor, Asplundh Tree Expert, LLC, as well as several smaller regional firms.
Principal methods of competition in both operating segments are customer service, marketing, image, performance and reputation. Our program to meet our competition stresses the necessity for our employees to have and project to customers a thorough knowledge of all horticultural services provided, and utilization of modern, well-maintained equipment. Pricing is not always a critical factor in a customer's decision with respect to our Residential and Commercial segment; however, pricing is generally the principal method of competition for our Utility segment, although in most instances consideration is given to reputation and past production performance.
We provide a wide range of horticultural services to private companies, public utilities, local, state and federal agencies, and a variety of industrial, commercial and residential customers. During 2021, we had revenues of approximately $176 million, or approximately 13% of total revenues, from Pacific Gas & Electric Company ("PG&E"), our largest customer.
Regulation and Environment
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among other things, labor, wages, health and safety matters, immigration, employee benefits and privacy and customer data security as well as requirements of federal and state transportation

agencies with respect to vehicles in our fleet. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to fines or civil or criminal prosecution and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, and results of operations.
Additionally, our facilities and operations, in common with those of the industry generally, are subject to governmental regulations designed to protect the environment. This is particularly important with respect to our services regarding insect and disease control, because these services involve, to a considerable degree, the blending and application of spray materials, which require formal licensing in most areas. Constant changes in environmental conditions, environmental awareness, technology and social attitudes make it necessary for us to maintain a high degree of awareness of the impact such changes have on the market for our services. We believe that we comply in all material respects with existing federal, state and local laws regulating the use of materials in our spraying operations as well as the other aspects of our business that are subject to any such regulation.
Marketing
We solicit business from residential customers principally through referrals, direct mail programs and to a lesser extent through the placement of advertisements in national magazines and trade journals, local newspapers and telephone directories. We also employ online marketing and lead generation strategies, including email marketing campaigns, search engine optimization, search engine marketing, and social media communication. Business from utility and commercial customers is obtained principally through negotiated contracts and competitive bidding. We carry out all of our sales and services through our employees. We generally do not use agents, and do not franchise our name or business.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal, primarily due to fluctuations in horticultural services provided to Residential and Commercial customers. We can also be affected to a lesser extent by budget constraints of our Utility customers. Because of this seasonality, we have historically incurred losses in the first quarter, while sales and earnings are generally highest in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. Consequently, this has created heavy demands for additional working capital at various times throughout the year. We borrow primarily against bank commitments in the form of a revolving credit facility and issue notes to provide the necessary funds for our operations. You can find more information about our bank commitments in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" of this report under "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
Other Factors
Due to rapid changes in equipment technology and intensity of use, we must constantly update our equipment and processes to ensure that we provide competitive services to our customers and continue our compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
We own several trademarks including "Davey," "Davey and Design," "Arbor Green Pro," "Arbor Green," and "Davey Resource Group." Through substantial advertising and use, we believe that these trademarks have become of value in the identification and acceptance of our products and services.
Human Capital
Our values — safety, integrity, expertise, leadership, stewardship and perseverance — are built on the foundation that our people are the key to our success and sustainability as a company. We aim to engage and inspire our employees every day, providing them with education and development opportunities to help them grow personally and professionally. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 10,200 people, of which approximately 92% were in the United States and 8% were in our Canadian locations. Of our active employees,

99% are full time, 1% are part time and 14% are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
We encourage you to visit our website, http://www.davey.com, for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Any reference to our website in this Form 10-K is intended to be an inactive textual reference only.
Oversight
Our board of directors provides oversight on certain human capital matters, including employee ownership programs and employee relations issues. The compensation committee of our board of directors oversees risks related to our employment policies and our compensation and benefit arrangements. Our Human Resource and Legal departments also have responsibility for advising, educating, and assisting the business on human resource matters and executing our overall human capital management strategies. In addition, the board of directors and the compensation committee receive regular updates from our Chief Executive Officer regarding human capital matters. 
Employee Attraction and Retention
As a provider of arboricultural, horticultural, environmental and consulting services, attracting and retaining top talent is critical to our success. We actively recruit candidates who share our commitment to advance the green industry. While our industry faces challenges of seasonal employment and high average turnover, our structure as an employee-owned company enables our talented employees to invest in us as we invest in them. Our recruiting and employee development team cultivates employee strength by recruiting, training and retaining a diverse and talented workforce. The team supports the hiring and early employee experiences of our workforce by utilizing recruiting hubs, which allow for better support to our employees while addressing hiring needs across the U.S. and Canada. We also offer a referral bonus program which encourages current employees to recommend people to join our Company. Employees receive a cash bonus for referring an individual who becomes an employee and remains employed at least 90 days.
We recognize that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, cultural background or religious belief. As of December 31, 2021, women represented 13% of our total employees, and minorities (defined as those who identify as Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and/or two or more races) represented 29% of our U.S. employees.
Education and Development
To sustain our growth, it is imperative that we invest in our employees’ personal and professional development. For nearly 140 years, employee education has been fundamental to our success, equipping each employee with the tools they need to deliver the best possible care to our clients. Through our Learning Management System ("LMS"), employees can access our extensive online education and development programs, consisting of over 650 courses covering a variety topics. In addition to online LMS training, we offer multiple in-person training opportunities at our Davey Institute and regional workshop sessions. The largest onsite training—the Davey Institute of Tree Sciences ("D.I.T.S.")—takes place each February in Kent, Ohio. A modern-day take on the original experiences taught by John Davey, D.I.T.S. is open to employees from all over the U.S. and Canada, and the program still uses a combination of lecture and outdoor experiential learning.
Additionally, ongoing partnerships with trade associations as well as an associate’s degree program offered through Kent State University provide Davey employees with opportunities to continue their education and advance their careers at Davey.

Safe Business Practices
Safety lies at the heart of our company. Our safety program – The Road to Zero – encourages a culture of communication, collaboration and consistency. We view safety and skills training as a continuous development tool and we provide both in-person and distance learning activities to 100% of our field employees each year through our safety department. Davey operates in regions across the United States and Canada where fire seasons and changing climate increase the risk of fire on and around our job sites. In areas with increased fire risk, employees complete an annual fire prevention curriculum developed in collaboration with multiple fire safety and forestry agencies.
In 2017, we implemented our Close Call Communicator, an electronic company-wide platform for safety communication. The platform allows employees to report a close call incident and share those incidents across the Company to build tools and tactics for prevention. Employees are encouraged to watch out for potential situations that may put themselves or their co-workers at risk and to speak up if they see something. These efforts serve to improve the holistic management of safety across our operations.
Compensation, Benefits and Well-being
We offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall health and well-being but recognize that supporting our employees does not end there. We encourage employees to plan for their future, and after one year of service, our employees are eligible to invest in our 401(k) plan, where we will match up to 5% of employees’ contributions, or by becoming a shareholder and enrolling in our stock purchase plan, where they can purchase shares of the company at a 15% discount. Both are great ways to save for retirement. We also offer a family scholarship program to assist employees with approved college education tuition and expenses for their children and legal wards.
We have a long-standing tradition of giving back to our communities across the U.S. and Canada, and we encourage our employees to get involved in the communities where they live and work to help grow a better future. In 2018, we launched the Green Leaders program, which recognizes employees’ volunteer activities that are meaningful to them, as well as supporting initiatives that promote trees, sustainable landscapes and the environment. In 2021, employees invested over 6,800 hours to organizations that were meaningful to them. We also encourage employees to give back by offering a charitable matching gift program whereby we match employees’ eligible contributions up to a preset limit.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to take steps to support our employees and protect their health and safety, while also ensuring that our business can continue to operate and provide services to our customers including continuing to provide additional administrative leave for employees affected by COVID-19 directly or indirectly. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021, we began to bring employees back to our corporate headquarters on a limited basis with increased safety protocols and in compliance with public health and government guidance and also began to lift travel restrictions in situations where necessary.
Core to our values is being there for our people when the unexpected happens. We have two employee assistance programs in place to support our employees. The first is our emergency employee assistance program, which provides grants to employees for food, shelter and other basic needs due to unexpected financial hardships. The second is our COVID-19 relief program through the Davey Company Foundation, which provides tax-free payments to employees for eligible expenses incurred as a result of the pandemic.
Domestic and Foreign Operations
We sell our services to customers in the United States and Canada.
